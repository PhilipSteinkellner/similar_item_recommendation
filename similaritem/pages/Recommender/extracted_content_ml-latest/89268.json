She was arrested, sentenced to be executed and sent to a concentration camp. Her attending physician in the camp, Dr. Ditten, had been a fan of her and helped her sent a letter to her son Mark Preysing. Mark rushed to Germany after receiving the letter and sought the assistance of police, locals, family friend Fritz Keller, and Countess Ruby von Treck; all refused to help and told him to go back to the United States immediately. Having inherited his mothers outspoken, free-spirited ways, a frustrated Mark soon aroused the attention of the Gestapo. Mark ended up meeting Dr. Ditten through Ruby, who recognized Mark and sympathised with him. He poisoned Emmy, causing a death-like coma sleep, so that Mark would need to make arrangements to claim his mothers body and get her out of the camp. Fritz, not knowing that Emmy was alive, agreed to help. Mark and Fritz got Emmy out but she was too weak and needed rest, so Mark brought her to Ruby, who turned her mansion into a girls finishing school after her husband died. Ruby took them in for the night, but refused to offer more help; as her survival depends on her relationship with General Kurt von Kolb, an older man insanely jealous of any man around Ruby. But seeing the mother reunited with the son woke the American in Ruby, adding to the attraction already growing between Ruby and Mark; she finally decided to not only help Mark and Emmy, but leave with them. Mark, Frtiz and Emmy headed for the airport first, Ruby was about to join them when General von Kolb returned, having sensed that Ruby was helping Mark. Torn between her patriotism towards both Germany and the United States, she decided to stay and hold off General von Kolb, so that Mark can get on the airplane safely.",

         "As a Norma Shearer fan, I looked for this movie for years and finally found it on TCM (hail the great god, Ted Turner!). First of all, I was surprised to find a movie made so early in the years of WW2 that actually brought up the topic of concentration camps, and the reason why Robert Taylor's mother is to be executed (she helped Jewish refugees leave for America -- \"Jew\" is never mentioned, but it is obvious). The performances are top-notch, and it was nice to see Nazimova toning down her usual grande dame-isness. I've never been a Robert Taylor fan, but this movie has one of his best performances as he alternately bucks authority in the good old American way and puts up with the Nazi-Gestapo badgering. Norma Shearer is fine, even though her role is small, and her scenes with Conrad Veidt (playing her Nazi suitor) are very effective. You can see her democratic side gradually gaining strength against Veidt's facism as she sees more and more of Taylor and his own dilemma makes her question her present beliefs. It's a must-see.",
         "This is another underrated film, probably due to the fact that in those days, the studios just churned them out. It's a shame that today, with fewer films being made, more can't be \"churned out\" like this one. A top-notch cast, including Robert Taylor, Nazimova, Conrad Veidt and Norma Shearer do justice to a very good script which at times has you on the edge of your seat. Robert Taylor plays an American who comes to Germany looking for his mother, a well-known German actress, who married an American and returns to Germany to sell her house. One can really feel his frustration as he frantically tries to find information on her whereabouts. Finally, he learns that she is in a concentration camp awaiting execution. Along the way, he has met Shearer, an American, who continued to live in Germany after she was widowed and is now seeing a German officer. The film is heavy on propaganda, as Taylor comes up against citizens afraid to talk and nasty, uncaring Nazis. Even Shearer refuses to help him initially, and an old family friend pretends not to know him. Taylor does an excellent job as both a desperate man and a loving, tender son. Without giving the story away, he has one magnificent nonverbal moment where it literally looks like the blood has drained from his face. Shearer is lovely, and Veidt is alternately charming and scary. Nazimova plays Taylor's mother in a strong performance. Though she went outside the studio to get Tyrone Power to costar with her in \"Marie Antoinette\" rather than use Taylor, both Shearer and Taylor were under contract to MGM and would meet again for Shearer's final film, \"Her Cardboard Lover.\" Some of the final scenes of \"Escape\" are very intense. Highly recommended.",
         "In the Ethel Vance novel, the role of the Countess is even smaller than it is in the film. The story has been re-structured to fit MGM's Norma Shearer (still the Queen of the lot at the time) and Robert Taylor. Taylor, always an underrated actor, gives one of his most forceful, sensitive and earnest performances as an American trying to free his mother from a German prison camp and seeking the help of the Countess to achieve his goal. Suspense builds as the Nazi menace (Conrad Veidt) threatens to destroy any hope he has of enabling his mother to escape. Handsomely produced, although much of the Alpine scenery has a studio-bound stage setting look, it gives us a glimpse of Norma Shearer's aristocratic beauty and Robert Taylor in his prime--which should be enough for some movie fans. Added to that is the suspenseful story and an excellent supporting cast--including Nazimova as the mother, Felix Bressart and Bonita Granville as a pro-Nazi sympathizer. It all moves rather smoothly under Mervyn LeRoy's direction, a glossy melodrama that unfortunately has never made its way to video. Well worth watching, so catch it if you can on one of the cable stations.",
         "This relatively unknown star vehicle is unusual for a number of different reasons. Although top billed, MGM Studio Queen, Norma Shearer's role is substantially smaller than co-star Robert Taylor's heroic turn as an American son desperately attempting to save his mother from a German Concentration camp. His mother is wonderfully played (and occasionally overplayed) by Nazimova, one of the great theatrical legends of the early 20th century. It's an interesting footnote, that it was Irving Thalberg who helped cut short the meretricious Nazimova's strange film career while his widow, Shearer, graciously allowed the former star to appear to great advantage in one of Shearer's last screen appearances. Conrad Veidt plays Shearer's Nazi lover and while he appears as icy and unyielding as he would two years later in \"Casablanca\", his character is softened somewhat by his un-disclosed illness and by Shearer's devotion to him. This film was one of the few made in Hollywood prior to the war which was openly critical of the Nazis (although they do hedge their bets by having a sympathetic German doctor, which gives the impression that more than a few intelligent German's disagreed with the Nazis. Significantly, this character does appear in full Nazi drag towards the end of the picture). Robert Taylor is given a very tricky part to play as a man determined to save his mother against all odds. With his masculine demeanor and his controlled sensitivity he gives a performance of great passion and conviction. Norma Shearer, looking regally beautiful and every bit the Countess, manages to convey the situation of a woman who desperately wants to help Taylor and leave her adopted country, but realizes that she must stay out of duty to Veidt, in spite of her true feelings. Felix Bressart also appears as the Nazimova's frightened but faithful servant, who helps Taylor escape. Bressart, who made a career of playing befuddled foreigners, is best known as one of the three Russian Communists in Ninotchka. Interesting casting was Bonita Granville, best known as the screen's all-American girl detective, Nancy Drew, here playing the role of a pro-Nazi student at Miss Shearer's finishing school (she would play a similar role in 1943's wartime propaganda film, \"Hitler's Children\"). The film was sumptuously mounted and stylishly directed by Mervyn Leroy the same year as he directed \"Waterloo Bridge\" also starring Taylor with Vivien Leigh. \"Escape\" is effective, at times shocking, but always vastly entertaining. Interesting footnote: Norma Shearer would turn down \"Pride & Prejudice\" and \"Mrs. Miniver\" both of which would turn Greer Garson into an MGM star much in the the same vein as Miss Shearer. Norma Shearer's last film, \"Her Cardboard Lover\" would also be opposite Robert Taylor.",
         "Robert Taylor is in Nazi Germany in search of his mother, a former prominent stage actress played by silent screen star Alla Nazimova. He meets a whole bunch of people in his quest, some who help and some who hinder. One of them is an expatriate American Norma Shearer who is the widow of a German Count and now involved with an Army General played by Conrad Veidt. Essentially that's the plot of Escape and a clever plot is hatched to help Nazimova escape from a concentration camp. With a few unexpected curves thrown in the way and a not so happy ending for two of the principals, you can probably figure the rest of it out. The most interesting character in the film is Conrad Veidt. He's a whole lot like the character Burt Lancaster played in Judgement at Nuremberg. A man who has disdain for the Nazis, but when they succeed in gaining power, he accomodates himself to the new regime as did so many in the German Armed Forces. But for something that happens to him in the film, I can see Veidt before the bar of justice at Nuremberg after World War II. Robert Taylor plays a 20th century version of Armand Duval, the part he successfully played opposite Greta Garbo in Camille. It's another role as a callow youth. He was getting old for those kind of parts and I think upon seeing him in Escape, MGM realized this. Taylor would be getting more mature parts from then on. Norma Shearer is the American girl essentially trapped by her now noble title in Germany. She's turned her spacious living quarters into a girl's school and she's living a genteel life, but one filled with anxiety. Eventually she has to choose between Taylor and Veidt and at the end of the film, fate makes the choice for her. Veidt and Shearer do the best jobs here. Taylor was now 29 and not suited for the Armand kind of part anymore. Still he does a good job and others to watch for are the ever dependables Alfred Basserman, Felix Bressart and Phillip Dorn.",
         "\"Escape\" represents the few movies Hollywood was making before America entered the war in 1941. This movie was Hollywood's way to ease into the war. They made two endings: one for America and one for the international market (they were already fighting in a war). The international ending makes more sense. You can see the movie with both endings on Turner Classic Movies. It is not on video - too bad. The movie is over dramatic, but in an intriguing way, interesting to watch. Norma Shearer and Robert Taylor are an unlikely romantic couple but it works. This is Ms. Shearer's second best performance after \"Marie Antoinette\". She is luminous and beautiful in this role. After this movie, she made a couple of terrible comedies and retired in 1942. Shearer's other co-star, Conrad Veidt as her Nazi boyfriend, suits her better in this movie because they are closer in age and have the same elegance and smooth-cultural speaking voices. However, Taylor provided some needed humorous remarks in the movie. The supporting cast is perfect, headed by Alla Nazimova, in her best speaking role.",
         "In the 1940's Mervyn LeRoy was a great director of many fine films and you can tell by the great actors performing in this film and the mysterious plot to this story. Norma Shearer,(Countess Ruby Von Treck),\"The Women\",'39, had an admiring Nazi General, Conrad Veidt,(General Kurt von Kolb),\"Casablanca\",'42, who tried to take over her life. However, Robert Taylor,(Mark Preysing),\"Johnny Tiger\",'66, came to Europe to find his mother who was a retired actress and being held captive by the Nazi authorities. There is a coffin and graveyard involved in this story which makes the film quite interesting, considering it was made in 1940. If you look close you will see Bonita Granville,(Ursula, a Student),\"Nancy Drew Pictures of 1930's\", trying to help Mark Preysing avoid being captured by the Nazi soldiers. If you love a very young looking Robert Taylor, this is the film for YOU!",
         "Just stumbled upon this movie tonight. Quite a gem. Lots of emotions involved in this movie, considering it is a son trying to save his mother from an undeserved fate. Nice acting by Taylor and Shearer, and Veidt does well as the ominous and ever-present antagonist. What I really liked about this movie is the timing of its making. It is before average American's really knew about Hitler and Nazi's, and well before Pearl Harbor, and America's entry into the war. Yet, it shows in a magnificently subdued way the political climate of the time, without ever mentioning Germany or Nazi's. Keep in mind, if you watch this movie, that the actors, directors, and producers knew nothing of the horrors the Nazi's would ultimately do. Seeing movies like this one makes me wonder what people were thinking at the time. Could the holocaust have been prevented? Is there something going on right now that we should take notice of, and maybe prevent? In summary, I say watch this movie, and try and put yourself in 1938 while watching. The movie has to be viewed from that perspective to fully appreciate it.",
         "Imagine! Returning to the country of yourself birth and finding yourself convicted of treason, then condemned to death, and for the sole crime of selling your old family home. Thus begins the nightmare one woman is plunged into in 1936 Nazi Germany, and is the setting for her son's desperate attempt to free and get her to safety. Robert Taylor plays the American-born son who goes to Germany to find out what has happened to his missing mother. Feel his shock and incredulity when he learns of his mother's impending execution. See his mounting desperation and frustration as his inquiries are met with fearful denials from the very people who were once his mother's friends and neighbors. To who can this lone American turn to for help? You will find yourself on the edge of your seat as you watch the unfolding horror, the near misses, the turning of fate. Better yet, read the novel this movie is based on.",
         "This is an unusual film for the Queen of MGM, Norma Shearer. Although she has never looked better, in this suspense drama, she is not the central character but rather a supporting one. The story centers on Robert Taylor who is desperate to evacuate his mother (played by the silent screen legend Alla Nazimova) from Nazi occupied Europe. Director Mervyn LeRoy keeps the pace going swiftly and contemporary audiences will enjoy the film as much as they did in 1940 when it opened at Radio City Music Hall in New York."

         "American Mark Preysing is in Nazi Germany looking for his German national mother, Emmy Ritter, a renowned stage actress. All he is able to learn is that she has been imprisoned somewhere in the country for treason against the German state for harboring German fugitives while she lived in the United States. A non-political but nonetheless outspoken person, she views her actions as humanitarian ones of helping German refugees in their time of need. What Mark does not know is that she is slated for execution at the end of the week. During his search for her, Mark meets some people who seem to know what is going on with his mother but won't tell him and won't help him for fear for their own safety from the Nazis. These include Fritz Keller an old friend from the United States, Dr. Berthold Ditten and Countess Ruby von Treck. The widowed Countess is a born and bred American who married into her title and has decided to stay in her adopted home country following the death of her German husband. The Countess has managed to live outside of the political fray of the Nazis, despite her somewhat romantic friendship with General Kurt von Kolb, who, despite not being in the army, is privy to the goings-on of the party. Mark has to convince these in the know to help him, all the while keep the truth behind his actions from the Nazis.",
