Today, more than a quarter of a century later, the movie looks as fresh and entertaining as before. Those who don't speak Russian lose a lot by not watching this piece of art. Every character is authentic and original. Sergei Yursky, one of the famous Russian comedians, is especially funny as Dyadya Mitya. Aleksandr Mikhailov, who in most other films plays a macho, here does an outstanding job as a simpleton Vasya. Fortunately, the director balanced well the contribution of Lyudmila Gurchenko, a veteran of the Soviet cinema, with that of the others. After watching the movie you have the feeling that you have lived together with the heroes."],
