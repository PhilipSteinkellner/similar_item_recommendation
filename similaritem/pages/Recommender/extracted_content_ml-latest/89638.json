         "A very promising cinema debut. Though most of it is set on the Irish West coast, the whole film has an Eastern European feel to it: sparse dialog, little music, beautiful still shots of landscape and interiors and relentlessly grim weather. I don't find the choice of location at all artificial. If you want to get away from one of the most densely populated countries in the world on a budget, the West of Ireland doesn't seem such a bad choice. This is a film not so much about loneliness, but about being alone. While the female lead clearly had a very negative experience before the story begins (loss of a loved one or traumatic end of a relationship?), one senses that her being alone in this remote corner of Europe is something she deliberately chose and eventually prefers. It seems male viewers have problems with her arrogance and rudeness, while women (including yours truly) find her strong and full of character. Stephen Rea provides a perfect match for her impulsive behaviour and injects a gentle sense of humour. Fortunately their developing 'relationship' avoids romantic clichés. I like films that leave you guessing about the characters' inner thoughts, motives and actions. Combined with the powerful imagery, it makes this one linger in the mind long after the house lights have switched on. Although I found the last scene puzzling and out of place and while the storyline might have been tightened up here and there, I am certainly keen to see what Urszula Antoniak comes up with in her next project.",
         "Lotte Verbeek and Stephen Rea, two highly accomplished actors, take on this thoughtful two- hander from Polish-Dutch débutant Urszula Antoniak about loneliness and the difficulty of human connection. Verbeek plays an unnamed Dutch woman who finds herself in Ireland after the end of her marriage and, having opted for an itinerant life free from life's trappings, ends up working on the isolated estate of recent widower Martin (Rea). They strike up an agreement: she will work for food on condition that neither exchanges any personal information about the other. The deal works for a while, but inevitably resistances crumble and the pair form a strong and, for the audience, steadily intriguing bond. Their personal as well as cultural differences clash and then mesh, leading to a co-dependency allegorical to most 'normal' relationships. Antoniak clearly has a good eye, and her performers give their all, but as the film's central premise � a Dutch girl wandering into the Galway countryside � is never explained (beyond the financial needs of a Dutch-Irish co-production), the result is perplexing rather than engaging. While Antoniak's restraint is admirable, from a dramaturgical perspective we are left to scratch our heads while indulging in shots of beautiful countryside. The result is impressive but curiously forgettable, and feels like the idea for a short stretched out into a feature-length film (albeit one that cleaned up at the Locarno Film Festival). We are certainly pulled into the head of the main character, but as her puzzlement and anomie for the world increases so does ours for the film, so any chance of redemption (or explanation) is not just missing, it's redundant. Antoniak is one to watch, but whether one could say the same for the film is not so much a question of quality but one of taste.",
         "Belying its' title, 'Nothing Personal' is clearly a very personal film. Set on the west coast of Ireland, this two-hander explores the decision to leave virtually everything behind and offers a study of loneliness and reconnection through a gradual re-building of trust. With strong performances from both leads, I was increasingly absorbed as their characters unfolded, and the film is at its' best in the gentle humour and the slowly developing relationship between them; there are some lovely touches and moments, like stopping the wind blowing through the grass. Unfortunately this undoubted emotional engagement seems to have come at the expense of narrative coherence. Whilst I don't expect everything handed to me on a plate, it felt quite an uphill struggle trying to follow the Director's clues about what was actually happening. I couldn't quite work out if the chronology was chopped up or not, and I felt the main device of leaving history unspoken between the pair was unnecessarily allowed to overwhelm plot lucidity at times, leaving me with too many unanswered questions for it to be a consistently rewarding experience; I look forward to reading the future IMDb message board musings of more perceptive viewers. I suspect the film will be compared to Ondine � similar location and 'strong, mysterious, beautiful foreigner' theme �and whilst undoubtedly more cerebral and emotionally resonant, it's a shame that its' increasing tendency to veer into a somewhat perplexing swamp rather lets it down. If you have a penchant for 'hands swirling round in seaweed' close-ups, then this is certainly the film for you � otherwise, despite its' spirit and intrigue, the level of confusion means that for me, it won't stay in the memory for too long.",
         "So I was quite pleased to see this, which, unbeknownst to me, has been a bit of a festival darling, sweeping all before it at Locarno winning six awards including the FIPRESCI, with multiple wins at the Nederlands Film Festival, and top prize at Marrakech. Director Urszula Antoniak was in attendance and said that this was her first film, it was very personal to her, and it was a perfect expression for her, she said she had all the means and finances she wanted and described it as a \"work of love\". Anne (Lotte Verbeek) has decided to start her life again and leave Holland, the milieu of what we can speculate has been a messy divorce, with nothing other than the clothes she is wearing and a backpack. She is in a whirlwind of pain and anger and has decided to reject the world and all people. She is quite rude to the few people she comes across. So she wanders through extremely beautiful and desolate Irish countryside scraping an existence. Eventually she chances across the most awesomely stunning peninsular hideaway, which took my breath away (location is so important in cinema). She is very rude and forms an uneasy symbiosis with Martin who gives her food in return for manual labour. He agrees to not ask her any questions, and make no demands from her outside of their contract. They're pretty much the only two characters we see. Anyway the relationship obviously develops but in the most fantastic and eventually heart-floodingly moving way, that renews Anne's faith in humanity and allows her to rejoin the living. I think the ending stuff is pretty iconic, and so well crafted in terms of plotting, so delicate. Very much of a feather with Esther Rots film Can See Through Skin which also won awards at the Nederlands Film Festival. I felt pretty much humbled afterwards.",
         "Based on the Locarno credentials of this movie (garnering six awards at that event, not counting many others) I decided to take a dive into some of my expatriate's work abroad. A very simple tale about Anne (Lotte Verbaek), who cuts away from everything connected to her previous life in Holland (most likely due to the death of her husband, but we can only speculate the real reason) and backpacks to Ireland. There she comes across an elderly fisherman, Martin, (the brilliant Stephen Rea), who lives in solitude in a desolate location close to the sea. On their encounter Anne is extremely rash, even rude, being in a state devoid of any warmth or friendliness. However they soon agree to an uneasy truce: Anne will work for food, but as long as no personal matters are touched. Set in untiringly beautiful locations of the Irish countryside the movie always manages to remain an eye-catcher (especially a fascinating peninsular, which is the main location of the movie), which helps keep the focus on the story itself, despite its very slowly unwinding rudimentary plot. Emotionwise I wasn't however fully convinced by Lotte Verbaek and additionally I did feel that several scenes/dialogues seemed not to fit the overall tone and logic of the movie. Nonetheless the whole story rings with a somber truth, as emotions and feelings catch the characters unawares, which leads to an absolutely heart-wrenching finale (the scene from the poster). Very simply crafted and set in the most basic human feelings it really has an unbelievable capacity to capture the attention and linger in memory. Despite it's flaws it remains a stunning, if very reserved, watch, which shows the immense potential of Polish-born Urszula Antoniak.",
         "Polish screenwriter and director Urszula Antoniak's feature film debut which she also wrote is a Dutch-Irish co-production which was shot on location in County Galway, Ireland and produced by Reinier Selen and Edwin van Meurs. It tells the story about Anne, a woman who moves out of her city apartment, takes the belongings she can carry with her and hitchhikes to the highlands of Ireland. After sleeping outdoors for a couple of days and living in complete solitude, Anne finds a remote farmhouse that intrigues her. Here she meets Martin, the owner of the house, who offers her a deal that she agrees to on the one condition that no questions are asked about her personal life. Subtly and acutely directed by European filmmaker Urszula Antoniak in her first feature film, this universal drama draws a mysterious and intriguing portrayal of an evolving relationship between two somewhat lonely strangers who coincidentally ends up living together. Finely photographed by cinematographer Daniël Bouquet and with its naturalistic milieu depictions, this meditative and charmingly romantic story about a rare relationship between a rural farmer and an urban vagabond depicts a finely paced study of character while examining themes such as interpersonal relations, loneliness, freedom, death and love. Set against the backdrop of the coastal highland landscape of Ireland and with an efficient narrative structure, this poignantly atmospheric and quiet love-story is impelled and reinforced by Dutch actress Lotte Verbeek and Irish actor Stephen Rea's understated acting performances. An unsentimental, humane and existentialistic directorial debut which gained, among several other awards, six awards at the Locarno International Film Festival in 2009 and the award for Best Actress Lotte Verbeek at the Marrakech International Film Festival in 2009.",
         "This film directed by Urszula Antoniak is what I would call non-gimmicky non-formulaic independent film. It's basically a two person film with terrific laid back performances from Stephen Rea, a wonderful Irish actor, and Lotte Verbeek, a Dutch actress. Verbeek is mysterious drifter who comes upon Rea's isolated home on the Irish coast. At first, she is hostile to any interactions with him. However, over time in slow and subtle ways they begin to bond. It all leads to what I thought was a touching and appropriate ending. I found this to be a surprisingly quiet wonderful film. For those with no patience probably not the film for you.",
         "After watching this film for the first time, I was intrigued. I felt the need to watch it a second time, parsing every minute detail to try to figure out what the hell was going on. So many questions; but I think I figured it out. Why did You go into Martin's house (before even meeting him) and rearrange his coffee mugs, then roll around in his bed naked? What happened in Amsterdam? Who was the woman in the house? Why in the world would Martin want to die after having this gorgeous girl move in with him? Most importantly, who is You? You is a witch. The events of the movie can only fully be explained by witchcraft. The weird coffee mug and bedsheets behavior was probably a hex of some sort. In Amsterdam, she probably killed her former husband before taking off to the next sucker (Martin.) I don't know who the women was, but it doesn't matter. Martin killed himself because he was under a spell and the vile temptress he invited into his home was actually slowly killing him for his house and his money. Bummer. Seriously, don't judge this interpretation till you've watched it again with this in mind. It's the only way I've found to make the movie make sense.",
         "I watched this alone, in a foreign cinema far from home and found it highly resonant. It is a love story, and one of some sort of healing of the senses. There are some exquisitely observed scenes, the sensuousness of her running the seaweed through her hands (several times) and their connectedness with nature form a counterpoint to their individual alienation and personal sorrow, their unrevealed grief. That and the scene in which she demonstrates an extraordinary culinary talent reveal a refinement that he shows us from the outset with his solitary decorum. The gradual acceptance of their feelings for one another is well constructed although like at least one other commentator I felt the use of some fractured chronology was ambiguous and unsatisfactorily edited. There is the eventual, inevitable tragedy, punctuated with some (mostly wry) comedy along the way but some sense of uncertainty at the end. Whatever else it may be, it features two very moving performances that are deserving of any awards the film receives.",
         "A unique storyline that captures the viewer's attention, wondering what these two will make of each other where primarily neither want to relate intimately with anyone else. A very interesting film in terms of every unspoken gesture, facial expression and events-packed silence. Part of the fascination is the viewer constantly wondering, \"What will happen between them next?\" And it is this tension that makes for a total attention. Can they love? Will they connect? Who will open up first? Why were they so alienated in the first place? Yes, a very existentialist piece reminiscent of Bergman movies, perhaps; certainly treating similar themes. By the end of this film, I was half in love with 'You', the female protagonist. Yup, it really got to me. Maybe you too."
