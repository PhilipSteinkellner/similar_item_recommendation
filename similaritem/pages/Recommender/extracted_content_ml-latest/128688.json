Tomi and his wife, Maria, are very happily married with two children. Tomi, quite by accident, meets a woman he is immediately attracted to, physically and more. Meanwhile, we find out that Maria's older brother has been unfaithful to his wife. These two stories run side by side throughout, although most of the film centers on Tomi and his genuine feelings for both women and where this leads them all. Some may find the film slow moving, since it is a straightforward depiction of the emotions people go through during such difficult times, but I found it beautifully done and I loved it!"],
