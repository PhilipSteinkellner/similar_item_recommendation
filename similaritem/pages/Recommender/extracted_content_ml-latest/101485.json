      "reviews": [
         "\"Upper World\" is almost unknown today, but is an interesting and enjoyable movie with a high powered cast and a well constructed story. A plutocratic railroad tycoon (Warren William) is drifting away from his social-climbing wife (Mary Astor) and begins a liaison with a good-natured showgirl (Ginger Rogers). The showgirl has a sleazy, opportunistic protector (J. Carroll Naish) who plans a little blackmail. When he springs his shakedown, guns go off and two people fall dead, leaving the tycoon in a situation which will ruin his reputation. Made in the early 1930s, the film is very discreet about the nature of the showgirl's relationship with the two men in her life, but this does not damage the narrative flow. (If remade today, of course, the sex angle would be graphic and blatant.) The film does however have two weaknesses. First, although he had genuine screen presence, Warren William had no talent for close-ups, where his wolfish smile is alienating and undoes his good work in medium shot. Second, the ending is a cheat and an evasion of the dramatic issues the film has raised. Later movies like \"A Place In The Sun\" and several directed by Fritz Lang were much more resolute in following the drama through to a plausible conclusion. \"Upper World\" presents a young Ginger Rogers who was just beginning her partnership with Fred Astaire. Katharine Hepburn's famous remark that Ginger gave Fred sex-appeal while he gave her class is relevant here, because Ginger is much sexier in this movie than in any of her musicals. (In her one musical number in \"Upper World\", Ginger wears a revealing dress which flatters her legs while the camera ogles her at thigh height.) Mary Astor, as always, is excellent, and brings out her character's craving for social status while keeping her human. The audience does understand why the tycoon married her in the first place. Both John Qualen's performance as a corruptible janitor and J. Carroll Naish's as the aspiring blackmailer make interesting contrasts with their work in John Ford movies. \"Upper World\" is a minor movie, but should certainly be sought out by fans of Ginger Rogers and Mary Astor.",
         "Within the context of B-dramedies, this is undoubtedly a great movie, but within the overall context of movies as a whole, it falls just short. While it utilizes an \"A\" cast, led by the superb Warren William, the plot just loses too much steam at the end to really feel like it meets its potential. The build-up in the movie, especially the sharp dialogue that is given to the aforementioned William, makes the movie feel even shorter than its hour-plus running time. It certainly never drags, and the grey characterization given to the various roles even makes the film food for analytical fodder. Unfortunately, the trial and cop-out yacht cruise ending come so fast and non-furious that even the most accepting of viewers will feel at least a bit cheated. Nonetheless, if you ever stumble upon this on TCM and have a little time to spare, it is more than worth your while, and is remarkably non-dated.",
         "I read another review and thought I would offer what I thought were the good points of this film. The film was a typical period B film of man finds girl when wife doesn't pay attention to him. The music is great and was later used as backdrop for short films. Also, we get to see Sidney Toler(who later became Charlie Chan) playing a Chan-like policeman; J. Carrol Naish, who starred as a gangster in many later films; Mary Astor, a star of \"The Maltese Falcon\", who showed some of the great facials she did in that film; and of course, and early Ginger Rogers. The dialogue is snappy and the direction more than adequate. Enjoy this one, it certainly isn't the greatest ever made, but it never claimed to be - just a film of the times. I gave it a 7 out of 10 for its overall against similar films.",
         "(Some Spoilers) On the verge of closing the biggest railroad merger in US history railroad tycoon Alx Stream, Warren Williams, is on his yacht cruising the open waters when he notices a young girl in distress. Saving the girl from drowning Alex offers her a lift back home in the city and during a chit chat with her finds out that she's Lilly Linda, Ginger Rogers, a showgirl at a local burlesque theater. Alex has been happily married to his socialite wife Hettie, Mary Astor, but he's been going through a change of life lately. Now running into Lilly he feels that she's just what he needs to put him back on track. Showering Lilly with gifts and sending her very personal letters and photos has the working girl falling in love with the multi-millionaire rail-man. Alex keeps the relationship between him and Lilly platonic treating Lilly more like a friend then a lover which is more then fine with her; since she realizes that he really has genuine affection for her and is not interested in having her go to bed with him. Back at the theater Lilly's manager Lou Colima, J. Carrol Naish, notices that Lilly is in loved with the big railroad magnet Alex Stream and his scheming mind come up with a plan to blackmail him. What he needs of the affair is proof and the letters and photos that Alex sent Lilly over time are the perfect blackmail items but Colima has only one problem: will Lilly go along with his plan. Fair motion picture about greed as well as cheating on one's spouse. As well as a person who's noble intentions are used to destroy his character and extort his money that leads to a double murder that he ends up being framed for. Both Mary Astor and Ginger Rogers are at their best, Mary at her stateliest and Ginger at her most glamorous, in this very earlier movie in their film careers. Look out for a very slim Andy Divine as Alex's chauffeur Oscar and future movie Charlie Chan actor Sidney Toler as officer Moron, an Irish/Chinese New York City Cop in the 1930's. There's also Dickie Moore who was a member of the Little Rascules as Alex's young 8 year-old son Tommy. J. Carrol Naish as the Burlesque theater manager is as usual the bad guy in the movie but he isn't too bright either. Colima lets Alex know what he planing for him and Lilly and even tells him that he not only knows about the incriminating letters that he sent Lilly but that he also has them on his person. The movie has Alex on the brink of ruin as he stands trail for murder and his railroad empire left in shamble but in the end his good deeds more then made up from his momentarily loss of control as well as his very innocent but foolish indiscretion that he had with Lilly.",
         "In early 1930s films, Warren William generally played ruthless, unscrupulous rich guys. Here, William stars as Allexander Stream, a wealthy, non-evil financier who is lonely because his wife (Mary Astor) is away for weeks at a time. A chance meeting starts an unlikely romance between Stream and showgirl Lilly (Ginger Rogers). After a time Lilly's manager, the very evil Lou (played expertly by J. Carrol Naish) wants to blackmail Stream using love letters. Murder and investigation ensue, leading to an unsatisfying conclusion. Rogers, Naish, Andy Devine, Sidney Toler, and John Quaylen (excellent as a corrupt witness) are very good. However, William carries the movie, in his usual elegant way. Mary Astor is not given much to do, despite her star billing. I recommend \"Upperworld\" for fans of 1930s cinema, even though I was extremely disappointed with the abrupt ending.",
         "Warren William, Mary Astor, Ginger Rogers, and Sidney Toler star in \"Upperworld,\" a 1934 film. William plays a railroad tycoon, Alexander Stream, whose beautiful wife (Astor) is too busy being a social butterfly to spend time with him. He drifts into a relationship with a chorus girl (Ginger Rogers) whose producer wants her to milk Stream for all she can get. She's actually a good kid and doesn't want to do that. Sidney Toler plays a policeman who's demoted after being rude to Stream, and he attempts to blackmail him when tragedy strikes. I'm a big fan of Warren William, and he's marvelous. He's not the fun-loving, relaxed detective of later films, nor the scoundrel of earlier ones. He plays basically a good man who's lonely. Also, he has a son (Dickie Moore) who, though no one calls him a brat, is a horror show. Nice ending. Nothing original about the story, but the acting is good.",
         "As a big railroad tycoon, the imposing Warren William carries the film. Too bad this fine actor is largely unknown today, even to many movie buffs. I expect it's partly because he died relatively young (54) many years ago (1948). Nonetheless, he has the looks, bearing, and talent of an exceptional screen presence, and it's always a treat for me to catch him in a new movie. The plot here is unexceptional� loyal husband Alex Stream (William), strays with chorus girl (Rogers) because wife (Astor) is preoccupied with high society. Problems arise when shady character (Naish) tries to blackmail Stream. Rogers is winning as the rather good-hearted lower class chorine; at the same time, her scenes with William manage a certain charm, though you know the romance has no chance. Note the film was released in mid-1934. I expect the Production Code's shadow tamed down this screenplay in comparison with earlier William films, such as Employee's Entrance (1933) or Skyscraper Souls (1932). Those screenplays also have William playing a hard-driving businessman. But unlike here, he's also ruthless in dealings and unscrupulous with women. In short, he's got the kind of unpredictable edge that made those pre-Code films so interesting and so threatening to Depression-era big business. On the other hand, his character here is basically sympathetic, more victim than victimizer. His business dealings remain peripheral, while the relationship with Rogers is more sweet than calculating or sexually provocative. In short, viewers will recognize familiar conventions from the 30-year Code era. The movie's smoothly done with an outstanding cast that includes a restrained Andy Devine, but is otherwise routine entertainment.",
         "The Following contains SPOILERS: As it's been pointed out by other reviewers this is a Pre-Code movie, released before the code took effect 7/1/1934...however the impending restrictions were known to all and had to influence how this movie was made. I did note in Ginger's dance number in the stage show, the chorus girls wore skin tight, transparent briefs. The film basically comes down to the following: Good guy (millionaire Stream...William Warren) is a lonely, doting father meets and romances Bad Girl Ginger. Meanwhile Mrs. Stream (Mary Astor) is too busy being Mrs. Socialite to attend to hubby or son. Warren starts out by trying to not get involved with drop dead gorgeous Ginger...but man and the flesh are weak. Her slimy boyfriend (J.Carroll Nash) tries to blackmail him and a double homicide ensues. Stream then tries to foolishly and clumsily cover things up...but gets caught, tried and since he's a good guy and rich...gets off scot free, wifey sees the error of her ways and they both pledge their love and then sail off on a luxury cruise. Perhaps if more time were spent in the courtroom before a quick resolution,this would have been stronger. Perhaps writer and director were trying to tell us the rich can always get off. It follows the moral code that was on it's way. Bad Girl Ginger must and does die. Good Guy and Good Girl reconcile and learn from their mistakes. Good, watchable...but could have bee better.",
         "Upperworld (1934) *** (out of 4) Above average crime drama from Warner with direction by Roy Del Ruth. A ruthless businessman (Warren William) is getting bored with his wife (Mary Astor) who's only interested in climbing the social ladder so he starts a fling with a showgirl (Ginger Rogers) but this turns out to be a mistake when her manager (J. Carrol Naish) tries to blackmail him, which leads to a double murder. There's a lot to recommend here but the key thing is the performances from the fine cast, which shines throughout the film. William is his typical cool self and Astor is in good form in the few scenes that she's in. The real highlight is Rogers who gets to play a lot of sexuality in this Pre-Code and that includes one scene where she's in a short bathing suit and trips over a bed so that her behind can be facing the camera. Dickie Moore is also good as William's son and Naish nearly steals the film as the ruthless wannabe gangster. Sidney Toler, the future Charlie Chan, plays the cop out to break William. Andy Devine rounds out the cast. The story has a few plot holes along the way and the ending is a letdown but this is still highly entertaining.",
         "What seems like another simple little precode is actually asking some complex questions here and I think it deserves to be more fondly remembered. Alexander Stream (Warren William) is a wealthy railroad tycoon. He's got a wife (Mary Astor) and son that he adores, but his wife is just more interested in being a society matron with all of its trappings than paying Alex needed attention. She apparently just thinks he's on autopilot and will never stray. It's not that she's a cold person, she's just preoccupied. Alex's life changes one day when, while yachting, he rescues a drowning girl (Ginger Rogers as chorus girl Lilly Linda). He drives her back to her flat, and he follows her inside for what is supposed to be just a minute. That turns into bunches of minutes as they hit it off. Alex's puzzled male secretary and chauffeur go up to see what happened and walk in on an innocent but strange scene. Lilly and Alex are playing piano and singing \"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf\" with Alex dressed up in some strange kind of head gear! Alex should be afraid, but not of the Big Bad Wolf, because in this beautiful young woman he is finding the companionship and fun he would like to have with his wife if only his wife would notice his frantic yoo-hooing! The friendship between Lilly and Alex turns to an affair when Alex's wife first forgets their anniversary and goes to a society event instead, and then goes on a weeks long yacht trip with her society friends while her and Alex's son is off at military school. There are two flies in the ointment. First, in the only real malicious act Alex performs in this entire film, he gets a cop (Sidney Toler as officer Moran) demoted to walking a beat for giving him not only a traffic ticket but some attitude. The second fly in the ointment is Lilly's - I guess you could call him a boyfriend, but he sure acts like an abusive pimp (J. Carroll Naish as Lou Colima). The only reason I can figure Lilly doesn't give him the air is that he put her in the show she is working in, and she had said before she hadn't been able to find work for a long time. So she needs this creep to butter her bread, but he has bigger ideas. He wants to use letters Alex has written to Lilly to blackmail the tycoon. Lilly wants no part of this, because she actually loves Alex. In a confrontation gone terribly wrong, Colima threatens Alex with exposure when he comes to see Lilly one night, a fight ensues, and Colima fires Lilly's gun at Alex, hitting and killing Lilly instead when she jumps between the two. Alex finds an oh so convenient second gun (Exactly how many guns did Lilly have lying around this apartment anyways?) and, in self defense, shoots Colima dead. Now Alex has committed no crime, but even if the police believe his story he is embroiled in a scandal that will ruin not only him, but his wife and child. He switches the bullets in one gun with the bullets in the second gun to make it look like a murder/suicide, hides the second gun takes his letters from Colima's coat pocket, and discretely drives away. His trick actually fools the homicide detectives, but there is one problem. Remember that beat cop who got demoted because of Alex and knows it was Alex that got him demoted? He is at the scene, saw Alex's car earlier in the evening while walking his beat, and looks around and finds the second gun and discovers the trick. He convinces his sergeant to give him 48 hours to solve the crime. How does this all pan out?Watch and find out. And remember that this is still the precode era. When I asked at the beginning of the review - does motivation count for anything? - I am really talking about Alex and the beat cop, Moran, whose career Alex damaged. The cop probably is more interested in destroying Alex, because he assumes he is a probable suspect, than he is in getting justice. If he succeeds in bring in Alex, he will be a hero by deed, but by motivation he is just doing all of this investigating for petty revenge. Alex never had any malicious intent in his affair with Lilly. He met Lilly completely by coincidence and did a good deed when he fished her out of the water. He would never have succumbed to her charms had his wife noticed he was alive, but here he is embroiled in at best a love nest scandal, and at worst a murder case if he is exposed. Give this one a look if you have the chance. Ginger was never lovelier and this is one of Warren William's more complex roles. Highly recommended."
