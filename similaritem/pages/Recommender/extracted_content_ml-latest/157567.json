         "content": "Right in the opening scene of Naanum Rowdy Dhaan, director Vignesh Shivan makes it clear what we are in for \u2014 a quirky \u2014 and at times darkly funny \u2014 comedy. We see a young boy, Pandian, sitting inside a prison cell, and just when we think that he is a juvenile prisoner, we are shown that he is actually the son of the station's inspector, Meenakumari. He strikes up a conversation with a small-time gangster (Naan Kadavul Rajendran, who gets a funny scene later on, which involves a pistol which makes a 'meow' sound when it goes off) in the cell, and this inspires him s much that he decides that he wants to become only a rowdy and not a police officer. \r\n\r\nThe boy grows up into a young man (Vijay Sethupathy) who behaves like a rowdy (his den is painted with fluorescent paint where the rates of various jobs (from cutting off one's hand to cross calling are graffitied), even though the only tussles that he is asked to mediate is between schoolboys. And the story he had heard from the prisoner in the cell impacts his life once again. A character from the story, Kadambari walks into his life. She is a hearing-impaired girl whose cop father, who had gone after Killivalavan (Parthiban), the gangster-politician responsible for his wife's death, is missing and she requests him to track him down. Pandian is smitten by the girl and decides to help her. Things come to a stage when Kadambari tells him that she will live with him only if he can defeat the gangster who took away the people close to her. \r\n\r\nThe plot might come across as a serious revenge drama, but Vignesh Shivan displays a lightness of touch throughout that makes the film so much fun. And, he keeps things breezy even when situations get serious. There is always a funny one-liner or a bouncy musical cue waiting to make us relax, and the comical and emotional beats of the film are brought together seamlessly in an admirable way. He is aided in this task by his music director Anirudh's rollicking score (and songs, which, for a change, are not bathroom breaks but add to the mood of the scenes), cinematographer George C Williams' gorgeous frames and editor Sreekar Prasad's cuts which keep even the serious scenes fleet-footed. The segment where Pandian and his friends try to kidnap Killivalavan is among the hilarious moments we have seen in Tamil cinema this year. The plan, as we expect, goes gloriously wrong, but is comedic gold. \r\n\r\nThe director also adds a bit of novelty to the storyline by showing us certain scenes and then going back to them at a later stage to give us a complete picture. Early on, Kadambari is brought into the police station when she is found wandering alone at night and picking up a fight with the cop. And when Vignesh shows us what had actually happened, things fall into place with an ease that is to be seen to believe. \r\n\r\nThere are a couple of moments where the film threatens to descend into melodrama. One happens when Kadambari gets news of her father's death and mourns for him. This scene goes longer than necessary and is shot in a self-conscious fashion (a close-up of Pandian and Kadambari's lips) that only yanks us out of the film. The other takes place in the midst of a shoot-out when we are told something has befallen Pandian's mom. We get a pay-off to this scene during the closing credits but it only comes across as indulgent. \r\n\r\nThe actors are terrific. There is none of the mannered performance that we saw in Vijay Sethupathy in films like Orange Mittai. Instead, he seems relaxed and that helps turn the character into a charmer. Parthiban has some crackling scenes and the actor manages to make Killivalavan comical and menacing at the same time. This is one of the strong performances of Nayanthara; perhaps, dubbing for herself has actually helped. And her disability is refreshingly handled in a matter-of-fact way (there is no solo violin wailing in the background to make us empathise with her) and the film has fun playing around her impairment (the scene where she is kidnapped by Anandraj, who play a small-time rowdy, is hilarious). RJ Balaji raises a smile every now and then with his pop cultural references. He even uses the screen persona of yesteryear villains Anandraj and Mansoor Ali Khan to add humour to the scenes. The only one who gets lost is Radikaa, with a character that stays offscreen after the initial scenes. Maybe, that is why the director chose to have the closing credits scene.",

         "Plot: Low-profile funny youngster who says himself as a 'don' helps his dumb girl friend to murder the real don who demolished her family. Director Vignesh Shivan tried a black comedy gangster script with Vijay Sethupathi and Nayantara in lead. Vijay Sethupathi character just remind me 'Das' of Soodhu Kavvum. Nayantara is a dumb girl seeking for revenge. Both VJ Sethupathi and Nayan became huge positive for this success. Next to lead roles RJ Balaji occupies nearly more than 50% of screen, but very few one line comedy worked. Veteran star Parthiban as main antagonist add some good flavor to the movie. Other gangsters in the film such as motta Rajendran, Anandaraj & Mansoor Ali Khan also good. Cast also includes two cops Raadhika as VJ Sethupathi's mom & Azhagam Perumal as Nayanthara's dad. The way how Vijay Sethupathi team & Mansoor Ali Khan team attacking Parthiban is one of the best laughter scene in recent times. Movie has very few cons such as commercial aspects added by the director via RJ Balaji. For the few days in Tamil industry film- makers trying to attract Ajith fans, I don't know why. Anirudh scores a decent BGM. George Williams never failed to impress. As a producer surely Dhanush will know how to promote the film & make steady ride in box office. Verdict: Vijay Sethupathi and Nayantara just steal the show.",
         "I have seen the movie in Simivalley, Los Angeles, USA. Screenplay is very good. Young Director did good job and become a one of the key success point. Dhanush is getting a good career as producer by making these kind of selected stories. Nayanthara and Vijay sethupathi did excellent job. Parthiban also did his best in this. Anirudh made decent job in songs and back ground music is good. RJ Balaji's comedy is OK. But should have been more better. Worth watchful movie. We can watch more than once. Please go and watch in theaters.",
         "I feel as a tamil guy great movie as youve seen as a tamil lover . The dialogues given by vijay sethupathi as the best tamil love guy. You will surely do th things he has done for your true love.nice and touchng movie.",
         "The movie was very good. Comedy was very good in the movie. RJ Balaji rocked in the movie. Vijay Sethupathi acted very well in the movie. Nayanthara also acted very well in the movie. Songs and BGM are superb in the film.",

         "Movie was promising with the good star cast like Vijay Sethupathi, Nayantara but what you get is nothing from it, because it has half baked screenplay. Yes ! It is true, the only Pros of this movie are Nayanathara's acting & Soothing tunes. Undoubtedly, all Songs are worth listening and remembering(Especially the tracks: Nuvvu Nenu & Nenu Rowdy ne..). Considering low budget & not so high production values it would have been a profitable venture in Kollywood. The movie pretends to be a dark Comedy but hardly it created any laughter. It is not upto the mark in terms of making you laugh. #ChiruReviews",
         "I have never laughed for a long time since the movie \"soodhu kavvum\" which was also acted by Vijay. Vijay delivered a simple ,epic and decent role.He was very simple in his comedies but which were epic.This movie motto was clearly \"Entertainment \" and it filled everyone's heart .Other characters were awesome too .Everything was timing.You will never bored or take of our eye of out the screen for a second in this movie.Nayanthara acted good ,innocent and beautiful as always .THe lines are repeated again now.I have never laughed for a long time eversince the movie \"soodhu kavvum\" which was also acted by Vijay.

         "The movie was promising with the title , sethupathi, naynthara , ananth raj etc. But what you get is nothing but an unbaked movie. The movie is said to be a comedy but rarely the scenes bring laughter. Only positive thing in the movie is nayanthara, she looks good and has acted differently. Rest actors are wasted. The hero agreeing to murder a person for his lover is a very bad theme. This is what you read in newspapers every week.The theme is very anti social and the sick part is the movie is supposed to be a comedy. THe movie is bad in terms of making you laugh or even watch AND ALSO A BAD THEMED MOVIE.",
         "As an Indian boy growing up not knowing any of the languages in India and being exposed to western culture throughout my childhood, watching Indian movies (particularly Tamil 'Kollywood' movies) was a pain in every orifice in my body. (This statement alone would offend half the Indian population, but please, bear with me here.) I hated the poor quality and downright predictable storyline that is predominant in most Tamil movies. It's like every movie NEEDS the following ingredients: 1. Cool Indian dude (you can tell he's a hero if he's fairer than everyone else around him in most cases) 2. Hot Indian chick (you can tell she's the heroine if she's fairer than everyone else around her. In every case.) 3. They meet and fall in love. 4. Family comes in and prevents anything from happening (Usually, the girl's side) 5. Cool Indian dude kicks some ass. 6. Chick sees this. Her family sees it too. 7. A couple of songs shot in Switzerland or England. 8. He kicks more ass, family loves cool Indian dude now. 9. The end. This movie however, is different. It has some of the above ingredients, but with a delightful twist. The storyline is certainly not a common one and the cinematography is excellent. Certain scenes were so absurd, as a viewer I was left wondering whether the movie was being serious. But it was absurd in a very good way. The main protagonist in the movie in many ways build an emotional connection with the viewers, a feat very few Indian movies manage to successfully pull off. Often times you would be rooting for him to succeed in his mission, but you know that it is a pointless one. That kept me hooked. Wondering how on earth is he going to succeed. The heroine in this movie is also an unusual one. I mean sure, she's fair and pretty and tall and all that, but she's also deaf. When most Indian movies portray a perfect heroine or hero, both of them in this movie are not the least bit perfect, which is breaking a serious cinema taboo in India. That for me, was already a good selling point. But the best part of this movie was without a doubt, it's music. Anirudh has outdone himself in his choice of music in this movie. The songs were memorable and it fit the scenes very well (oh and there are no random dance scenes in Switzerland. Yay for logic.) The ONLY complaint about this movie that I can honestly make is Nayanthara's acting. It was poor. She clearly did not take the time to study how lip readers speak, how the behave and how they carry out their daily routines. I have never seen a completely deaf person speak perfectly. I have never heard a person who's gone deaf speak ANY language which as much precision as she did in this movie. So yeah. Maybe they can dub the movie again with an actual deaf person to make it seem more believable, because as it stands, I did not for a second believe that she was deaf in that movie. Not even after she told everyone that she was deaf. Overall though, it's still a good watch. I am glad to see Tamil movies take steps to be different. Final verdict: 8/10",
         "Naanum Rowdy Dhaan - NRD (2015) Review: (press see more to read complete review) NRD is a straight sit back, relax entertainment type of movie where we have to set aside our logical brains and enjoy the simple yet enjoyable ride with Nayantara and Vijay Sethupathi. Coming to the plot as we can guess from the trailers and promos it is very straight. An aspiring soft core Rowdy falls for a deaf girl and wins her love. With all necessary ingredients like good music simple day to day cinematography and a pinch over dose of cringe humour. Now what makes the movie stand out is its simplicity in the flow or narration with normal locations like Pondicherry and Chennai with comic tit bits from all sides of the cast. Nothing about the movie will be serious may it be a murder or sympathy over a deaf girl or stabbing or kicking or even a mother's sentiment. So I can say compare it with Mr.Bean types where prime aim is laughter. So don't enter thinking this movie will have life changing experience or message. That's all about the plot. Coming to the casting, obliviously first is the heroine of the movie which is played by the lady superstar of Tamil cinema, the dazzling and dusky Nayantara. What can I say? This lady has captured all the hearts through her roles that she has been playing recently. This time she portrays and convinces us as \"Kadhambari\" a Deaf yet bold as well as innocent (I mean usually the Genelia types of role). She is fresh with her new simple elegant slim looks. Our versatile hero Vijay Sethupathi takes up the role of Pandi from Pondy has done justice with his shaved looks but felt he was looking a bit older for this type of role. Other than these two we have Parthiban as the real rowdy again what he does is serious but shown in a funny manner. It was a good addition support from RJ Balaji and Ananth Raj who cracked jokes when they were on screen. Music by Anirudh who has hit the right chords to win youth hearts of today. The album on overall has good numbers to listen. Particularly \"Yennai maatrum Kadhale\" and \"Neeyum naanum\" are competing additions to the top 10 songs of 2015. Other technicalities where well in place to a level what was required. Now the verdict would be with all positives I felt it was a pure laughter riot. But deserves not more than 6.",
         "This movie's plot is not a different one from Tamil cinema, Same revenge story in the point of female version. But the way of telling and the powerful performance from Nayanthara and Vijay Sethupathi will make you sit through the entire show. Apart from the main characters, everyone done decent jobs especially R. Parthipan, Radhika and RJ Balaji. The main plus of this movie is hilarious comedy, dialogues and Performance. In some places, felt draggy and stupid, but director Santhosh Sivan manages to deliver a good show. Vijay Sethupathi looks charming and his acting is quite wonderful. And Nayanthara played as a deaf, steals the entire show. On the other hand, R. Parthipan is perfect fit for negative role, delivers his role quite interesting. But when comes to music department, I felt uncomfortable. The songs are good but heard some where, especially \"Thangame\" the first song. The starting music is the same from Yuvan \"I have a dream\" from Pesu movie. And the BGM also not good. It is awful!!!. Anirudth is a great young music director in tamil industry, done a decent jobs in his previous movies. I wont say, he lost his charm in this movie. But he should put some more effort, I think. However, Vijay Sethupathi came back on his track and the finest performance from Nayanthara. This movie has a whole entertaining package that makes your two and half hour worth.",
         "Simple story but superb narration. Screen play is awesome . Especilaly nayanthara looks stunning and never saw this beauty before in any of her films. Her beauty is getting increased day by day So her acting. I don't know the costume matches with Tamil actress Tapsi some how because of the hair style and the frock costume. Her original voice also so sweet to hear. Vijay sethupathi also did his perfect job. Kudos to the whole team.",
         "The award for best acting in this movie or to say the award for the best characterization goes to Mr Parthiban. The Protoganist Vijay sethupathy playing the role of 'fake rowdy'  brings the movie into the comedy genre. The opening scene rises the question if an ambition pursued to be a police is a symbol of power or an ambition to be a rowdy is a symbol of power. This question is raised by a little boy and the answer is given beautifully as a small short story narrated wonderfully by actor rajendran . The subject of the story is 'revenge' but this not the type of serious revenge movie but a revenge movie filled with comedy. Thats what makes this movie special. Revenge and comedy?! A new genre i guess. The best scene is where nayantara asks vijay sethupathi to romance her provided he agree to kill partiban. This scene is the best scene of the movie. Both have performed to the extreme in this scene. The theater groans with excitement during this scene. Another sequence that stands out is when  nayantara boldly going all alone to avenge parthipan. The comedy depicted by all the actors in  this sequence is at  the peak. Audience in the theater including me felt a treat to laughter at this sequence. The climax leaves us confused as the Protoganist starts the movie saying it is powerful to be rowdy by profession but ends the movie saying he has decided to become a police as he feels more powerful  as a cop."
