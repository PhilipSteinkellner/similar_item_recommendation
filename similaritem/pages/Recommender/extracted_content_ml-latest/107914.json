         "There is something about the look and feel of this film I love. It reminds me in some ways of \"Martin\" - my favorite urban vampire flick. Not that Fade To Black has anything to do with vampires, its about a lost and lonely nobody whose film life takes over from his mundane, put-upon reality to the point where he takes revenge on the world dressed as his fave film figures. Its a cute conceit for a film so obsessed with film references. Dennis Christopher is such a distinctive figure and his sexual scene in this film is just... quaint + oddly saucy. I think this is a cult film ready to be resurrected. Its camp, violent and Mickey Rourke is in it in a bit part. Think \"Taxi Driver\" cross-bred with \"Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer\" and \"Polyester\"",
         "I first saw this film a few years ago which details a geekish movie buff that lives in a fantasy world of movies. Dennis Christopher plays Eric Binford, a young man living with his crippled, domineering aunt, and who works as a studio film delivery boy for a living. The nerd-like Eric gets teased and abused by his aunt, his nagging boss, and his co-workers. Seeing that this is a horror film, you know it's only a matter of time before Eric goes over the deep end and beings killing people, but the twist is he kills them by copying various death scenes from his favorite movies. With his studio connections, he dresses up as his favorite characters, (Dracula, the Mummy, etc.) for the killings. Although we can relate to Eric Binford as a troubled soul, his character is not very sympathetic for it's not hard to see the reason why nobody likes Eric. With the exception that he knows a lot about movies, underneath he is just a hollow, chain-smoking, ill-tempered, clod. A subplot which includes a police psychologist tracking Eric's moves comes off as excess baggage and even the psychologist himself is not likeable either. In fact with the exception of the actress who plays the Marilyn Monroe lookalike, every character in the film is annoying, obnoxious, loud, selfish, mean-spirited and that hurts the film. I think it could have been a lot better if it was made by more professional filmmakers other than talented amateurs. It was a good idea for a movie, but not well made. Although the storyline is good, some of the plotlines are not believable, the violence and special effects for the killings (mostly shootings) look cheep and phoney, and the editing is poor. But worth a look if you're a fan of the movies and just want to see some clips of your favorite B-movies, oafers and classic horror films. This is Dennis Christopher's show and he takes hold of it and doesn't let go. Probably his finest hour-and-a-half.",
         "The low-budget production had the premise (innovative and creepy), but the execution of it seemed a little off when it had to count. I wouldn't call it just a horror film, as it had a bit of everything in it. For old-school Hollywood film-buffs it was ripe with numerous knowing film references (inter-cutting snippets of features), where our smugly weedy protagonist (a multi-layered, skin-crawling performance by Dennis Christopher) begins to confuse fictional with reality after everything in his life begins to crumble as his realises there's only one way to escape it. He begins role-playing characters and scenes with nothing but conviction. While these sequences were creative, it just seems to take away from the underlining horror. The dark humour seems to fit, but the script is sorely underwritten due to some stringy sub-plots (mainly that of Thomason's character) that are poorly thought out. Not that they couldn't added anything, but they could've if a little more exposition was spent on them. Instead they feel trivial. The backdrop is interestingly displayed with the director Vernon Zimmerman using genuine locations where it cooked up some gritty atmospherics. Some moments were kind of overdone (when the unstable homicidal nature and identity crises kicks in, when the torment gets out of hand), but it keeps you highly involved. I didn't find it particularly suspenseful (other than the climax), but the way it's organised shows enough drive and originality. Other than Christopher, the rest of the cast (featuring the likes of Norman Burton, Tim Thomason, Eve Brent, Morgan Paull, and John Steadman) are mildly okay. A perky Linda Kerridge (the Marilyn Monroe look-alike) has a good screen presence and there's a small role for Mickey Rourke. Craig Safan's smoking, uncanny score works a treat.",
         "Dennis Christopher stars as a young film buff with no sense of a real family, no friends, and an obsessive need to live through film vicariously. He soon begins to act out the violence he sees on the big screen, and people close to him soon die. Although the premise for the film is original and innovative, the film does have some budgetary constraints and suffers from a weak overall plot. Notwithstanding the pedestrian direction and amateurish performances in general, the film does have a likable quality to it and does pay tribute to some great films while Christopher turns himself into various characters. Christopher does a rather good job in his demanding role, a role that really needs more flesh to it. The rest of the cast is rather blah with Tim Thomerson really giving an excrutiatingly bad performance as a psychologist working with the cops. Linda Kerridge stands out for her beauty if nothing else as an Australian Marilyn Monroe look-a-like. Christopher stands into such roles as Richard Widmark's killer in Kiss of Death, Dracula, the Mummy( a very poorly shot and conceived bit), Hoppalong Cassidy and Laurence Olivier in The Prince and the Showgirl. For those of you with a good background in film, the movie takes on a different level of meaning and is fun as a homage piece.",
         "There are three types of horror films 1.the scary horror film (designed as you would think to scare you. 2.The black comedy (Its meant to be funny, but not everyone will find this true. Third and last are the dramatic horror films, they play like a drama film except they are much darker and usually have something to do with mental illnesses. This movie is of the third kind, It is a sad character study of a young man called Eric who spends all his time watching movies and finding out trivia about them. He has no apparent friends and he lives with his wheelchair bound aunt, who really is at odds with him. The film is very original and has a incredible lead performance from the actor playing Eric. They cops on the other hand are all really badly done, I just couldnt wait till they left the screen and every time they appeared again I grimly waited for there departure. Most of the other actors do quite a good job in this film and it also sports a young Mickey Rouke in what I think was his first film role. I would recommend this film only to horror fans, The film references, the characters and the direction are all tuned to giving any horror fan a good time for their money. Its not for everyone. But thats what I liked about it.",
         "This one presents an interesting and original idea for a slasher: a disturbed film buff kills people who have wronged him while dressed up as his favorite movie characters! It even has a Hollywood backdrop: in fact, I visited some of the places where it's set � such as Hollywood Boulevard (the violent climax itself takes place atop Grauman's Chinese Theater) and Venice Beach � when I was there in late 2005/early 2006. Still, despite some undeniably good moments, I don't feel that the film extracts the full potential offered by this fascinating premise: to begin with, some of the references it makes are simply too obscure to be picked up by casual audiences (99 RIVER STREET [1953]) � while to others is attributed a significance beyond their worth (Hopalong Cassidy, THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL [1957]). The film is buoyed, however, by Dennis Christopher's striking leading performance � who gets to 'play' popular roles, interspersed with genuine excerpted footage, from the horror (Dracula and The Mummy), gangster (James Cagney from WHITE HEAT [1949]) and Western (William \"Stage\" Boyd as the afore-mentioned cowboy hero) genres during his various stalk-and-kill maraudings; he even replicates the famous wheelchair-down-the-stairs murder of an old woman perpetrated by a cackling Richard Widmark in KISS OF DEATH (1947). Also notable are Tim Thomerson (later of TRANCERS [1985]) and Linda Kerridge: the former appears as the Professor of criminal psychology who reveals himself sympathetic to Christopher's plight (he's assisted by a female rookie, but eventually gets overruled by the stuffy Precinct Captain); Kerridge's uncanny resemblance to Marilyn Monroe, then, makes her the perfect 'idol' to drive Christopher in his warped crime-spree (among whose victims is a young Mickey Rourke). Finally, the film is equally enjoyable as a time-capsule � for the singular opportunity it offers of seeing various current releases on the marquee (ALL THAT JAZZ [1979], KRAMER VS. KRAMER [1979], COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER [1980], HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT [1980], SERIAL [1980]).",
         "This is a favorite movie of mine. I rushed out and got it on video when I heard it had been released. A lot of people here have given impressions of the story, I won't add to their great comments. What I would like to say is this this movie is a tremendous tribute to Hollywood Classic Movies. You will see snippets of many films here, all will be readily recognized. You will see Dennis Christopher's character slip deep into psychosis and take on the personas (and look..) of many of these characters in order to wreak his revenge. The more you know about old movies, the more you will get out of this film. Yes, it's essentially a slasher movie but this goes beyond the genre to get deep into the head of a killer. I like to think of this movie as a movie-fans version of \"Sunset Boulevard\", showing a broken mind on the other side of the fence. Worth seeing.",
         "'Fade to Black' may not be one of cinema's greatest films, but it is a minor masterpiece of sorts. cinema great does'nt quite hit it, but it does have the feel of a masterwork. and it is definitely some kind of epiphany and homage to cinema that reaches a strange plateau that is hard for any film to surpass or emulate. while referencing so many cinema classics from the Golden Age, and many horror films, it creates an all new cinema monster. this time the monster is the cinema fan himself. the viewer and film buff. it's about a guy who thinks, lives and breathes cinema. and combined with a disillusionment with life, it turns him into a ghoulish horror. this whole thing is sort of a 'Walter Mitty' story gone terribly wrong. it's about how our fantasies both make us, control us, and can often break us. it's this guy's fantasies that make him inspired and unique. they are also his coping mechanism to deal with a hum drum frustrating world. but when his world begins to go terribly wrong, the coping mechanism goes into overdrive and drives him into delusion and murder. you could write a text on this stuff. it's brilliant. the acting is just great by Dennis Christopher as the obsessed cinema fan turned homicidal mutant. there is also a hilarious bit role played by a fledgling Mickey Rourke as one of Christopher's unfortunate victims. and an intense performance by Eve Brent Ashe as Christopher's wheelchair bound aunt/mother. but possibly the real stunner here could be Linda kerridge, an uncanny Marilyn Monroe look alike. her performance is both haunting and truly memorable. and she looks so much like the real Marilyn M. at times, that you have to take a double take. she is especially good in the final scenes where Christopher acts out 'The Prince and the Showgirl' while feeding her Quaaludes(hey boomers, remember ludes?)and pumping her with alcohol, ending in an exciting escape to the top of the Chinese theater in Hollywood with a strange 'King Kong' type ending. crazy. Vernon Zimmerman's outstanding direction also recalls the 'B' flicks of Roger Corman and Robert Aldrich. all in all, this is an amazing and memorable cinema experience guaranteed to haunt any true cinema buff for life. if you are a real fan of cinema, and classic Hollywood, and don't mind being \"punked\" a little, this film is for you.",
         "I'd agree that \"Fade to Black\" works better in theory than in this actual execution. It should have been more fun, and admittedly the hook IS quite delicious: what if an unstable film geek murdered those who mocked him, while dressed up as his favourite cinematic characters? The main problem is that our antihero, Eric Binford (Dennis Christopher), an employee for a film advertising firm, is not sympathetic in the slightest. This isn't a character whom you feel sorry for and root for so much as you want to smack him around. He's an ill-tempered, whiny wimp who attaches way too much importance to his knowledge of movie trivia. Then again, this may well have been the intention of writer / director Vernon Zimmerman. One of my Internet acquaintances once described \"Fade to Black\" as \"showing the dark side of being a film geek\". Eric seemingly can't relate to anybody on a normal level, instead thinking entirely in cinematic terms. As unlikable as Eric may be, however, it's hard to say whether the problem is in the character as written or any ineptitude on Christophers' part. Another thing that doesn't help are the scenes with the normally entertaining Tim Thomerson as a liberal minded police shrink. The character is a dolt and one doesn't want to root for HIM, either, even if he is sympathetic to Erics' plight. It's still a fairly enjoyable experience, at least for any cinephile. Amid all the movie references, clips from classics such as \"White Heat\" and \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\" are edited in with ease. And it's cool to see Eric dress up as Dracula, The Mummy, and Hopalong Cassidy, etc. while in the act of doing away with his nemeses. The good supporting cast includes Norman Burton, Morgan Paull, James Luisi, Eve Brent, John Steadman, Marcie Barkin, Peter Horton, and a swaggering young Mickey Rourke. The major bright spot is Australian beauty Linda Kerridge, a Marilyn Monroe lookalike who actually gets named Marilyn in the movie. As Erics' would be girlfriend, she shines. A nice music score by Craig Safan and a rousing face off on top of Manns' Chinese Theatre are also highlights. Six out of 10.",
         "I'm absolutely obsessed with movies, especially horror, and I'm guessing that you are too, since you're currently reading an IMDb review of a relatively obscure, thirty-five-year-old horror flick. But as much as we love films, I doubt that either one of us is quite as crazy about them as Dennis Christopher's character, Eric Binford, in Fade to Black (at least I hope not). Eric, a shy, dysfunctional loner, immerses himself in the make-believe world of cinema 24/7, ultimately confusing reality with fantasy, taking on the identities of characters from his favourite films to mete out punishment to those who victimise him. Disguising himself as gangster Cody Jarrett from White Heat, cowboy Hopalong Cassidy, and Universal monsters Dracula and The Mummy, he settles the score with his overbearing Aunt Stella (Eve Brent), a workplace bully (Mickey Rourke), and his tyrant of a boss. Eric also poses as Lawrence Olivier from The Prince and the Showgirl to woo a Marilyn Monroe lookalike he meets in a diner (Linda Kerridge). Meanwhile, the police are trying to piece together the clues before the killer strikes again� Fade to Black is a technically competent effort with some stylish touches�the inter-cutting of old movie clips is a particularly effective trick�but the film suffers from some weak performances (Tim Thomerson, as a counsellor working with the police, is extremely wooden), a script that just gets more and more ludicrous (where the hell does Eric find a working tommy gun?), and a message that doesn't sit very well with this particular movie fan: that consistent exposure to violent movies will cause the viewer to act in a violent manner. We horror fans take enough crap as it is, without our own genre making us out to be loony tunes as well!"
