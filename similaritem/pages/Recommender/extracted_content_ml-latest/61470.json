         "This is one of my favorite movies. The film has a good storyline. Actor, Stan Shaw did an excellent job in his role as Tyrone Washington. He went on to perform another great acting job in \"The Great Santini\". The boot camp scenes where spot on authentic with the Drill Instructors. Reminded me of my bootcamp when I entered the Air Force. R Lee Emery does a great job in his first movie but my favorite drill instructor in the film is the Puerto Rican Gunney that rips the new recruits a new one. Amazingly, a lot of people don't know about this film. In my view, it's one of the most entertaining military/Viet Nam movies that have ever been made. Great movie!",
         "I think this movie never received the credit it deserved, mainly because it was poorly promoted. I was a motion picture projectionist when this film made its debut, and the theater posters depicted this movie as some kind of wacky McHale's Navy-turned-Army flick. Though it has some humorous parts, this movie is more serious. It follows a group of young men -- most who are drafted -- through an insane time in history. It depicts the war and the problems with drugs, sex, human relationships, fear, hatred, blackmail, government corruption and more. This movie really moved me. Forget Platoon!",
         "I loved it, and guess having been a soldier, I got the humor of it. Everyone compares it to \"Full Metal Jacket\" but \"Three Kings\" reminded me more of it. I have to have this one in my DVD collection. I was told that it was done and released as a very limited number.",
         "I have seen comments that this movie doesn't show the Vietnam war the way it was. I strongly disagree -- I think this movie tells it like it was: A war of politics, greed, drug abuse, and general mayhem. My only gripe regarding this movie is the short sightedness of the company that owns the rights not to release it on DVD, and a special remastered DTS/Dolby Digital version at that.",
         "The Boys in Company C (1978) was a movie that follows the recruits from Company C. Golden Harvest known for their Bruce Lee films and Jackie Chan productions made several films that were targeted for a world wide audience. One of them was this film. A very good film about the war in Viet-Nam that's is sadly over looked by other films such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket. Shot in the Phillipines and filled with many minor stars (with the exception of the great R. Lee Ermey) this one has an aura of realism (i.e the real Drill Instructors and boot camp scenes). I liked this movie very much. Too bad it has never been restored to it's original wide screen aspect for maximum entertainment. If this were available on D.V.D. I would call this one a keeper. Highly recommended.",
         "This movie would be just a regular by the numbers movie about war, weather the Vietnam War or World War II. You have a bunch of stereotypical screw ups who get thrown into Marine boot camp during the Vietnam War. The film follows them thru boot camp to the hell of 'nam. These boys become men and it doesn't end happily for one of them. The scenes in boot camp are funny and also very realistic. This was the first film appearance of Lee Ermey as their drill instructor. His first words on screen are \"I'm Sergeant Loyce I'm your drill instructor for the next two f@&%ing months maggots\". He is really funny and theres a good scene where him and Stan Shaw have a blazing argument (although in real life you would be in the brig for talking to your DI like that). Thirty years ago drill instructors were allowed to be a lot rougher with privates then today and my favorite part is where this one DI grabs a daydreaming recruit by the....well watch it and see. Actually the DI Lee plays in this film is almost a nice guy compared to the one that he played in Full Metal Jacket. The scenes in Vietnam are handled as well, especially the ones showing the horrors of combat. They talk about the drug smuggling that went on and the film is unflinching in how it shows the machinations of the politicians who sent our men out into the field with one hand tied behind their backs. No one we suffered such a humiliating defeat. This film is gritty, vulgar and unsentimental but it is a true story we must not forget about a terrible war that ripped our country apart like the Cival War. Like I said though, Lee Ermey makes this film. I love him on Mail Call. I think my favorite part of the show is the one where he talked about the paratroopers at D-Day. Someone wrote him an e-mail and asked if it was true that they really said Geronimo when they jumped. Lee said that wasn't true at all and what they probably said was \"OH S#$T!!!!!!!\"",
         "Having been in the military, this was one of the most true to life movies of military boot camp and life in Vietnam. Mr. Ermey, although I had never known him personally, portrayed the D.I. splendidly and must have been an outstanding D.I. in real life for the Marines.",
         "Never had there been a film that captured so well the bonds of men in war. The relationships that develop seem completely natural and in no way forced by writing. This movie accurately depicts the struggles that face all men in grave situations, with and without friends at their sides.",
         "An interesting war film that is mostly overlooked by Full Metal Jacket fans. Stan Shaw gives a good performance that when I which makes me wonder we he hasn't had a bigger career. This movie shares the soccer connection with the Caine/Stallone movie \"Victory\" (1981/I). I actually think the soccer scenes were better done in Company C. Nonetheless this movie is an interesting choice which any war movie buff should not miss...",
         "This is easily far and away the BEST movie made about the war. It is very VERY realistic, yet also points out the absurdity of how the war was fought to keep Dow Chemical and Colt Firearms in business. I was there for 18 months and believed in what I was doing, but we were sold out by the Government and Big Business and were sacrificed for a nation that didn't care about us, or even want to know what we were doing, for the most part. It also shows how very different types of people can change in their attitudes, like how Tyrone goes over a mercenary type, and comes to like and even respect his fellow jar-heads and dislike his old way of thinking. All in all, it's a great flick, and when the He** is it coming out on DVD?????????????????????? My VHS copy is falling apart! C'mon, Hollywood, put out a GOOD film for a change!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

         "This war drama (which prefigures the later \"Full Metal Jacket\") follows the lives of five young Marine inductees from their training in boot camp in 1967 through a tour in Vietnam in 1968 that quickly devolves into a hellish nightmare. Disheartened by futile combat, appalled by the corruption of their South Vietnamese ally, and constantly endangered by the incompetence of their own company commander, the young men find a possible way out of the war. They are told that if they can defeat a rival soccer team, they can spend the rest of their tour playing exhibition games behind the lines. But as they might have predicted, nothing in Vietnam is as simple as it seems.",
