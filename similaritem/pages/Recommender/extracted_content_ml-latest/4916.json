         "content": "They sacrifice themselves like samurai, these Americans. \r\n\r\nA critical part of WWII gets the big epic cinematic treatment, with all star casting and lots of noise. Though purporting to be exactly how things were during this particular battle, a pinch of salt is also needed. Much of the film is taken up with laying foundations for the air-sea engagement of the title, political posturing and military machinations are joined by needless sub-plots. The dialogue is often cheese laden, some characterisations equally so, while the splicing of real life footage and other war movie moments start to detract. However, the last third of film is thrilling and worth waiting for, a whirl of battle action as the Pacific conflict comes vividly to life both visually and aurally. 6.5/10",

      "synopsis": "Six months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. Navy still has not fully recovered from the losses it suffered. In April of 1942 the US staged a desperate stopgap measure to bring pressure on Japan by launching Army bombers under the command of James Doolittle from the USS Hornet to bomb Tokyo and other cities. While the raid achieved relatively little in terms of damage, it has sent a wave of panic among Japanese leadership, and the commander of the Combined Fleet, Isoroku Yamamoto, sees it as opportunity to implement a planned attack on the island of Midway, near the Hawaiian Islands, a plan designed to bring out what is left of the US Pacific Fleet and finish it off before American industry (which has long scared Yamamoto given its greater strength over Japan's) can fully commit to rebuilding American strength. The proposed operation encounters resistance from Admiral Nobutake Kondo, who doesn't believe Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo can survive another attack by the First Air Fleet's carriers against a target certain to bring out land-based bombers. While the command corps of the Imperial Navy debates Yamamoto's plan, US Navy Captain Matthew Garth, a go-between for the Navy's Pacific command - aka CINCPAC - is consulting Navy intelligence chief Captain Joseph Rochefort, who spends his full time in a dank underground chamber decoding Japanese radio traffic with a staff of assistants. Rochefort has been getting some traffic about an area of interest to the Japanese known only as Objective AF. Garth, meanwhile, has a more personal issue to deal with, as his son, a Navy pilot, has fallen in love with a Japanese girl on Oahu, at the worst possible time given the wholesale internment of Japanese on American soil. Rochefort's codebreaking allows the Pacific Fleet to learn of a Japanese invasion force heading for Port Moresby. Two of the Fleet's four available carrier groups - the USS Lexington and Yorktown - are dispatched to the Coral Sea, where they engage two of the First Air Fleet's carriers, Division Five, the Shokaku and Zuikaku, and a smaller carrier. The Lexington is attacked by some two hundred Japanese planes and sunk, while the smaller Japanese carrier is sunk and some damage is wrought to the rest of Division Five. The Yorktown is also heavily damaged and some 100 US aircraft are lost. After the Yorktown returns to Pearl for repairs - a three-month job compressed to three days via 1,200 technicians working around the clock - Captain Garth and Joe Rochefort meet Admiral Chester Nimitz with after-action reports from Coral Sea. It is here that Rochefort broaches a theory that Objective AF in Japanese code traffic may be the Island of Midway, near Hawaii; Rochefort asks that a dummy message about a shortage of fresh water be sent from Midway in the clear. Deciding no harm can come of it, Nimitz has his aide LTC Earnest Blake have the message sent. Days later a transmission from the Japanese warbase on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands is intercepted by Pearl and it confirms that AF is indeed Midway. Garth awakens Nimitz with the news. Meanwhile Yamamoto has laid out his plan - a Northern force is to invade several Aleutian Islands to draw US attention from Midway, where the First Air Fleet - now down to four carriers, the Akagi, Kaga, Soru, and Hiryu - will attack Midway; Admiral Kondo's invasion fleet will then occupy the island and the US will have no choice but to counterattack with their remaining carriers, under the presumed command of aggressive Admiral William F. Halsey. There is no concern for the understrength nature of the First Air Fleet given that Division Five was considered the weakest unit of the Imperial Navy's carrier force. Admiral Nagumo, though, does have some misgivings that the plan depends on the US reacting as expected. Nimitz meanwhile gets bad news - Halsey has been hospitalized and will not be available to defend Midway, so he hands command to one of his cruiser commanders, Raymond Spruance. Atop this, Nimitz has to deal with Vinton Maddox, a \"scalp-hunter\" from Washington who believes the Japanese are feeding radio traffic to deceive Hawaii into being outmaneuvered by a Japanese strike at Hawaii itself or even California. Captain Garth is assigned to the USS Yorktown, now operational despite Coral Sea damage, under Admiral Frank J. Fletcher, while Admiral Spruance commands the carriers Enterprise and Hornet. Also assigned to the Enterprise's air group is Matt's son, Tom, angry that his father tried to intervene on behalf of his girlfriend. In early June long range reconnaisance seaplanes spot the two Japanese armadas, and as expected Nagumo's air fleet attacks Midway, slaughtering the island's small group of fighters and strafing and bombing the area. Nagumo, though, has ordered scout planes to probe the area he expects American sea forces to be - northeast of Midway, as they indeed are. But a scout plane is late getting launched, a fateful delay when the Midway attack commences and returning aircraft arrive to the fleet almost out of fuel and some sustaining damage - just as the tardy scout plane picks up the US fleet and Nagumo's assistant Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi recommends an immediate attack on the US force even with aircraft not properly armed for anti-ship action. The Midway attack has brought out the air armadas of the three US carriers, but attack by torpedo planes is intercepted by Japanese fighters; Group Eight from the USS Hornet is massacred and only Ensign George Gay survives, while Group's Six and Three achieve no success either; Tom Garth and other fighter pilots do succeed in shooting down several enemy fighters but Tom's plane is pierced by fire and the cockpit blows up in flame, severely injuring Tom. Amid the martyrdom of the Torpedo Groups, Raymond Massey and Max Leslie of the Enterprise and Yorktown's dive bomber squadrons reach the enemy force just as Nagumo has begun to launch his planned attack on the US fleet; caught completely by surprise, the Japanese carriers are pummeled by dive bombers and their flight decks, stacked with launching aircraft and bombs carelessly stacked aside, are ripped to shreds. Within a minute or so, the Akagi, Kaga, and Soryu are shredded and left in flame, with only Tamon Yamaguchi and the Hiryu left to attack the USS Yorktown.",

         "I can't help but agree with most of the other comments: the sloppy production values, the scenes \"borrowed\" from better movies, the countless anachronisms, the distracting subplot about Lt. Garth and his Japanese girlfriend, and so on. But for me, this movie has two strong points in its favor. One, when they get around to the actual battle, they follow the history with surprising accuracy. (The \"Pearl Harbor\" makers could have learned something from this one.) So the movie's hard to follow? So was the actual battle! Personally, I think they did a pretty good job of keeping the flow coherent while still remaining faithful to its source material. The second thing in its favor is that, from the moment I first saw it in the theater as a 10 year old, it ignited in me a passion for the Battle of Midway that remains to this day. I can't think of any other movie that even comes close to getting me as hooked on its subject as this one. Maybe it's a good thing I first saw it when I was young, when I was much less discerning about production values, etc. That way, I could concentrate on the story itself. If you have even the slightest interest in military history or even in important historical events in general, do yourself a favor. Watch \"Midway\" to get an overview of the event (fast-forward over the love-story scenes if you like), then go read \"Incredible Victory\" by Walter Lord (which is a better book than the one for which he is most famous, \"A Night to Remember\"). You won't be sorry.",
         "Of course \"Midway\" is a flawed movie. The subplot about Japanese-Americans is ridiculous and seems like a forced attempt to be PC during the post-Vietnam 1970s when it wasn't in fashion to be completely celebratory of America. Of course it's unsatisfying that the Japanese actors don't speak Japanese and we have to hear Paul Frees dubbing Toshiro Mifune. Of course the stock footage isn't going to please aviation and naval buffs who know these details like the back of their hands, but to me this is a trivial complaint that fails to take into account the limits of 1970s technology or budgeting. \"Pearl Harbor\" ultimately got those details right through CGI and the end result was a far worse film in the final analysis. Because ultimately, for all the flaws that are in \"Midway\" it succeeds because it does stick to the essential truths when telling the story of the battle, and I know this because when I first saw this movie on the CBS Late Movie around 1979, I got so hooked that I went out and read every book on the battle I could find including Walter Lord's \"Incredible Victory.\" The movie had given me a starting reference point and while I was sorry that some key aspects of the latter stages of the battle were not depicted (such as the torpedoing and eventual sinking of the Yorktown), I couldn't have asked for anything better in terms of getting me to learn more about this great turning point of World War II. As far as I'm concerned, it's good that Hollywood did tackle this subject in an era when the influence of \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\", \"The Longest Day\" etc. still hung over the proceedings because if it hadn't been made back then, we would today be forced to see it given the \"Pearl Harbor\" and \"Titanic\" treatment that is pure garbage. John Williams contributes one of his finer pre-Star Wars scores with two great themes, the \"Midway March\" (which is only heard in the end credits of the theatrical version and became more popular in an expanded concert arrangement by the Boston Pops) and the \"Men Of The Yorktown March\" which dominates much of the score and offers great foreshadowings of the Throne Room sequence in \"Star Wars\" and the Smallville music in \"Superman.\"",
         "Saturday night TV is a bit of a dead zone down here so I suppose one should be grateful for the odd watchable movie, even if its 20 years old. This one looks older than it actually is, due to the liberal use of stock footage and a cast that's a retirement counsellor's dream. A relatively youthful Charlton Heston is in the lead, but there's Henry Fonda, Glenn Ford, Robert Mitchum, Robert Webber and even the great Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. A curious aspect is that every military character with a speaking part is an officer; the grunts just get to grunt. It's very much the view from the bridge (and the pilot's seat). Despite this aspect and the attempt at historical realism it's not made clear quite how it was that the Japanese made the error that cost them the battle, getting caught with their flightdecks full just as the American torpedo bombers arrived. The contribution of the American land-based aircraft is also given scant recognition. Still you do get a bit of a story, though the less said about the silly sub-plot involving the Heston character's son and a Japanese-American girl the better. The director, Jack Smight had extensive T V experience, as did many of the younger actors, and this shows up in the rather static dialogue scenes you get when you aren't allowed to move the cameras much. The Japanese voices are dubbed, so that Paul Free, the voice of Boris Badenov in \"Bullwinkle,\" (and countless other cartoon characters) is Admiral Yamamoto. The music was written by John Williams who a year or so later did the music for \"Star Wars\" and you can sense the similarities. In the film the military operations side of things abounds with anacronisms, partly due to the liberal use of stock footage as mentioned. I don't think you can be too hard on the producers (the low profile but financially successful Mirisch Brothers) for not using a real Japanese World War 2 aircraft carrier since they are all at the bottom of the sea, but the crashed jet on the Yorktown's flightdeck was a bit sloppy. \"Tora Tora Tora,\" which cost more money, was a better film. Not because it cost more money but because it was more carefully made, more balanced (both side's story told well) and more honest, perhaps also because it dealt with defeat rather than victory from the American viewpoint. \"Midway\" has some suspense, plenty of action, and the the patriotism drum is not banged to the point of pain.",
         "This was one of my favorite movies when I was growing up and building models of land, sea, and air craft of the WWII period. Of course we all could have done without the romantic interest, but what counts is the overall telling of the story accurately (even if that includes sideline dramatizations etc.). In a nutshell Midway was a gamble and even though we knew where they'd be, we still took it on the chin with the loss of most of the aircraft and the Yorktown (which left only 2 effective carriers in the pacific and 1 in drydock). In the end we were lucky enough to be able to inflict sufficiently more damage on them than they did on us. This is the story that is told so well. It doesn't matter that the special effects were less than stellar (e.g., view of the fleet from the sealevel - obvious miniatures) or that they showed Essex class carriers which did not yet exist getting hit by kamikaze. The film is true in its depictions of gambles, gaffs, and good fortune which in the end allowed us to be victorious and end Japanese expansion. So quit knocking it and enjoy it for what it is!",
         "The film Midway shows in graphic documentary style, the battle that did nothing less than save America and ultimately allow us to win World War II. If the Japanese had prevailed at Midway, they might very well have taken Hawaii and been blockading our continental Pacific coast. We might have had to declare a truce and hope that public opinion would allow us to continue the European and North African war. Remember the USA was brought in to the war because of the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor, not Hitler's attack. There is a plot of sorts with Charlton Heston as the fictional pilot group commander who's involved in helping his son Edward Albert help a Nisei family who've been interred for the duration of the war because Albert is engaged to the daughter. That's the one weakness of Midway, the story really wasn't necessary and detracted with the very precise telling of the Midway tale. Had they left it out, Midway had the potential to be a classic like The Longest Day. Without Charlton Heston and his family problems, the story of Midway is told with remarkable historic accuracy. Henry Fonda who played Admiral Chester W. Nimitz in all but name in In Harm's Way, gets to play Nimitz again in Midway. Robert Mitchum and Glenn Ford play Admirals William Halsey and Raymond Spruance who between the two of them won America's Pacific war. A whole lot of fine character actors like James Coburn, Robert Wagner, Robert Webber, Hal Holbrook and many more fill their naval roles to precision. The story of the Battle of Midway should be told and told again in America's public schools for future generations. Not just because of the sailors and airmen of America's greatest generation who fought and prevailed at Midway, but because of just how close a run thing the Battle of Midway was. One very fateful decision by Admirals Yamamoto and Nagumo turned the tide of battle on a dime. By the way the oriental players in Midway like Toshiro Mifune as Yamamoto and James Shigeta as Nagumo and others also play very well. The American cinema certainly came a long way from when they previously cast the Japanese as bucktooth primates. When the viewer sees just how much pure luck played a part in winning at Midway, they will come away with one of two impressions. The first might be that a divine providence is guiding and protecting America. If so, who's to say that will always be the case. And if not, the second lesson might be that we as a country might not always be so lucky. If they could edit out the Heston family story, Midway is a great film for history classes studying World War II.",
         "This is one I first saw when it was in theatrical release. In that, it had the whole Coral Sea sequences in it, and the film dragged. My thought was, even then, that they had a lot of battle footage they wanted to show, nothing more. And on the battle scenes. Some of them appeared to be stock footage originally shot on 16mm, then blown up and cropped for widescreen. In the theater, the graininess of the footage was masked by showing the scenes by defocusing them! Although a lot of the film is superfluous, one aspect of it rang true: the cryptanalysis of the Japanese RED cipher, and the \"mousetrap\" set to determine which target AF was. Commander Rochefort was not treated well at the time, but at least this film gives his efforts the credit they deserve. The release of the film to videotape helped considerably by chopping out a lot of superfluity, though not all of it. Compared to The Longest Day, or other equivalent war film, this one doesn't have their stature, but at least it provides the viewer with entertainment.",
         "I remember reading that this movie was made primarily because they had excessive footage from when they shot \"Tora! Tora! Tora! and some of the shot looks like they did came from that film. But this film also includes old actual shots taken by service men and news people. The movie is based on the American victory off Midway Island. The movie was made 30 years after WWII and a couple of years after Vietnam, so it doesn't have a jingoistic feel to it. It has more of a matter of fact feel to it, more a docudrama than propaganda. The movie is different from most war movies because it shows how Grand battles are won and lost. There isn't much individual heroism from ordinary soldiers shown. Instead we see how commanders, in this case admirals make decisions and take risks usually based on sketchy information. They put their reputations on line, along with the safety of their men, and the security of their nations. We see how the outcome of a battle can hinged on risky decisions or sometimes on indecision. We see how commanders have to sweat out their decisions as History hangs on the balance. Yes! History! This battle after all is considered the turning point of the War in the Pacific. In this movie decisions are made on what certain letters mean, whether enemy carriers are where they are supposed to be. If viewers give it the appropriate attention, they will see that this movie plays like a giant chess match. The outcome determined by gutsy moves and bad decisions, sometimes indecision. The movie boasts an impressive cast which include, Henry Fonda, Glenn Ford, Robert Mitchum, Cliff Robertson, Charlton Heston and they all do fine jobs. They play the typical Grand characters in epic movies, they move the story along but has no personal stories themselves. The one personal story belongs to Edward Albert, who plays Heston's son. He's not very convincing and playing opposite a pro like Mr. Heston, he comes across as being weak almost amateurish. The movie is good but far from great. I love how the filmmakers remained true to the events. But the special effects looked cheap and the use of actual combat footage feels inappropriate and even exploitive. Nevertheless I think it's a good film not to be missed by Military History buffs.",
         "This film is not an action-packed war film filled with constant loud heroism and stirring speeches. It is, however, a film which gives a good overview of how the battle of 'Midway' unfolded. Fewer explosions, more dialog - almost like a documentary in its pacing and focus. It has a large cast, and thus cannot focus much on character development, instead looking to the events to power the story (again, like a non-biographical documentary). Though the 'goofs' page is filled with anachronisms and inaccuracies (stock footage from the wrong era, using Essex-class ships for Japanese, etc...) the film does get the major 'plot' points down. i.e.: American signal intelligence intercepts revealing the Japanese plan, the sequence of carrier and land attacks, the critical decision(s) to arm and rearm the Japanese attack craft, etc... Overall, this film seems to be one of a lost genre - big-budget semi-documentaries. Similar to 'Tora Tora Tora' or 'The Longest Day'. A large cast of big-name actors, focus on factual retelling of the events.",
         "I've been an avid war movie junkie since I was but a wee boy. I still am. Lately I've revisited one of my favorites. Midway. I have seen this movie countless times on TV but recently picked up a DVD copy of the special edition. I have previously spotted several flaws in the film but forgave them since there is only so much real combat footage to be had and the movie does blend it rather well, rather well for 1976 anyway. However as I viewed it late one night I spotted a rather troubling image! An SBD(dive bomber dauntless) was attacking a Japanese carrier( I don't remember which one and it doesn't really matter) which opened fire on the diving aircraft. When the scene switched back to the plane it was a German twin engine BF-110! I am serious, I had to pause the footage and slowly rewind it frame by frame to be sure. I am sure. The footage clearly shows a twin engine plane exploding, frame after frame the image develops in which you can see one of the engines blowing off the wing and then a black cross(swasitka) on the opposite wing. The scene changes suddenly and the plane is never shown again. Did the editors miss this or did they assume the public was too ignorant to spot it? Either way this is a terrible blunder. A German plane at Midway attacking a Japanese carrier!? Wow! Beyond this the acting and dialog is as other reviewers have stated, dreadful! The extra scenes made for the TV release as well as a VERY SHORT docu with Charleton Heston add little to the original release. Honestly, I like Charlrton Heston but I'm not sure why. His acting is always the same. Bad. Still there is a draw to him. There are a number of early acting cameos by Erik Estrada, Robert Wagner and the like which are very entertaining after so many years(almost 30). The overall history reproduction is good with the good and bad luck shown clearly. This battle should have favored the Japanese but instead was the beginning of their demise in the Pacific. I still recommend this movie but watch closely for planes to change from SBD's to TBD's and so on as they mix and match real footage with models and props. An engrossing if flawed 1976 WW2 classic!",
         "This has to be one of the slowest-moving war movies ever. And I was afraid of it back when it came out, because it was in Sensurround, which meant the woofers were tweaked low and you got to not only hear but feel every rumble as the bombs and torpedoes lit into the oil tanks and set the carriers ablaze. That was a pretty intimidating sound back in the day, lemme tell you. But that was a million years ago. Midway was one of the greatest military battles ever, certainly the greatest naval contest of the greatest war ever, and as a conflict showcasing equal parts bravery, strategy, and luck. But this movie is a strange recreation that promotes aging 1970s star power over a coherent plot line. Most perplexing is the concentration on many over-the-hill American actors in telling the story of how the battle for Midway was won by the Red, White, and Blue. Charlton Heston carries much of the story, yet both his character and his actions are highly unrealistic. For a near-flag officer, we're asked to accept him called on in a pinch leading a dive-bombing squadron at such an advanced age. Henry Fonda scratches his head as Admiral Nimitz, stuck at Pearl Harbor as the war is fought hundreds of miles away, while Robert Mitchum's Admiral Halsey is confined to bed with a nasty skin condition, and Hal Halbrook as an intelligence chief seems to suffer from a bad case of BO. At least we were spared a John Wayne cameo, as an admiral who couldn't leave the john with a nasty case of hemorrhoids. In movies about D-Day or Operation Market Garden, we got to see a little more of a few of the trenchline view, which enhanced our appreciation of what was endured as well as what was won (and lost). Here it's all a case of transferring flags and staring at maps by the highest commanders. Boardroom battles. Meanwhile, the Japanese high command seems populated exclusively by Arnold from \"Happy Days,\" Jack Klugman's assistant in \"Quincy,\" and assorted North and South Korean extras from \"M*A*S*H.\" A nice sense of the decade, except that decade is the 1970s, not the 1940s. It's a battle whose story deserves telling, but not with cutscenes from \"Tora, Tora, Tora\" and \"The World At War.\" The tacked-on subplot with American-boy-loves-Japanese-girl feels suspect, like a politically-correct nod at inclusiveness at the expense of telling the story the way it happened. If they really wanted to be inclusive, it would have been a Zero pilot and his Yank girl, who swears she has nothing to do with awful FDR and his foul plans against Japan's Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. What else is there to lambaste? The ridiculous supers we get around various characters, including no less than three around the lone survivor and Kojak sidekick George Gay, as played by Kevin Dobson? The silly radio chatter among the American pilots, who sound more like American Top 40 DJs than warriors trying to sink the Imperial Navy? I like the occasional hints of verisimilitude we get, like the oil burns around the cowlings of Avengers about to launch, but the blue paint on the American jeeps and the Essex carriers that substitute for the Japanese fleet distract too much for any real enjoyment. Read Gordon Prange, and leave this be."

         "The summer of 1942 brought Naval stalemate to the Pacific as the American and Japanese fleets stood at even numbers each waiting for the other to begin a renewed offensive. \"Midway\" tells the story of this historic June battle where a Japanese carrier force, in an attempt to occupy Midway island and lure the American fleet to destruction, was meet valiently by US forces operating off of three aircraft carriers and numerous escort ships. It was the first battle in which naval air power was extensivly used, and at its conclusion the Japanese Carrier force had been completly destroyed which lead the way for the US 1943 and 44 offensives which would eventually bring the Pacific War to a close.",
         "The battle of midway is done with captions to identify historical characters. Historically accurate in its major points, a subplot of an American flyer who is engaged to a Hawiian girl of Japanese descent has been added. This is the battle in which the previously undefeated Japanese fleet was stopped in a battle during which all damage was done by aircraft. The opposing fleets never saw each other.",
         "The 1942 battles of the Coral Sea and Midway island are retold through the points of view of both sides. When an audacious US air raid reaches Japan itself, Combined Fleet commander Isoroku Yamamoto orders seaborne invasions of Port Moresby in the southwestern Pacific and of Midway Island near Hawaii, invasions that Yamamoto hopes will smoke out the US Pacific Fleet for destruction before the full might of US war production can kick in. The Japanese are supremely confident of victory over the vastly outnumbered US fleet, but they are unaware that US Navy intelligence has cracked the Imperial Navy's codes, allowing the US to deploy aircraft carriers to maximum counteroffensive effect.",
