Our hero is first shown inventing stories as a French boy in a small town between WW1 and WW2. As a young man he meets a local girl, marries her and is employed by her father. On the liberation of France he runs away to Paris where chance encounters lead to his learning important lessons in begging, sex and employment as means of survival. Following the end of the war in France he deliberately inveigles himself into Resistance circles, copies the speech and knowledge of genuine veterans and is eventually regarded as a hero. His contacts and apparent experience result in his being sent to occupied Germany as a military observer. Here he is coincidentally forced to order the summary execution of several French defectors to the SS following which he confesses his lies. He is jailed for a short period of time on an unrelated charge following which he is rehabilitated to become an international political success.",

         "\"The best lives are invented ones. I forget who said that. Perhaps it was me.\" Thus claims Jean-Louis Trintignant in one of the brief modern-day 'interviews' in Jacques Audiard's wryly amusing and constantly engaging Un Heros Tres Discret/A Self-Made Hero. The main body of the film follows Matthieu Kassovitz's Albert Dehousse, Trintignant's younger self, an innocuous underachiever dreaming of heroic acts he never gets the chance to carry out who is devastated when he discovers his wife and new family have hidden their resistance work from him and denied him his chance to be a real hero. Betrayed, adrift and penniless in a newly-liberated Paris, he learns to take advantage of a moment in history when anything is suddenly possible and, thanks to fortuitous friendships with genuine hero Captain Dionnet (Albert Dupontel) and well-connected collaborator Monsieur Jo (Francois Berléand), reinvents himself as a self-effacing hero with just enough inside knowledge to get by. He gets himself photographed in the crowd at war crimes trials, gradually inveigling his way into newsreels with real veterans and even makes capital out of the fact that many of his comrades have no idea who he is by amiably telling them they clearly don't remember him and shouldn't embarrass themselves by pretending, shaming them into 'remembering' him and allowing him into their inner circle. An honest liar who knows how to listen and to sell the stories of others as his own, often to the very person he overheard it from, he rarely lies but rather omits, leaving his audience to fill in the gaps, just as he never asks for anything but simply takes what is offered because of who his audience has convinced themselves he is. Not that he's the only one reinventing himself � the whole nation is as it tries to reclaim its dignity from the shame of Occupation and collaboration, with heroes and tycoons becoming villains overnight and new heroes coming out of nowhere to replace them. At such a time and in such a context, he's more a symptom of a country that wants to believe in itself again and so will consequently believe almost anything. To one degree or another, everyone in the film lies and reinvents themselves � even the aged resistants rewrite their friendship into distrust for the benefit of the modern-day cameras in light of subsequent events while others choose to believe the lie and even embellish it. In many ways the consummate actor demonstrates what an asset to the resistance movement he would have been as he effortlessly infiltrates the past to invent the person he wanted to be, and his inside track on the mechanics of deception actually makes him far more ideal for his job rooting out collaborators than those who really did fight. Occasionally including modern-day interviews with fictional veterans and, at one point, a character talking to camera about his life of disappointment and eventual pointless death, despite the variety of stylistic devices it's a remarkably cohesive and controlled film, putting its various techniques at the service of the story rather than drawing attention to themselves. More than that, it's also very entertaining and often laugh-out-loud funny, never falling into caricature despite brief moments of surrealism, and a striking well-observed comedy on the foibles of human nature worthy of Billy Wilder that more than amply repays a second viewing. Optimum's recent UK PAL DVD offers a good transfer, though irritatingly the subtitles are not widescreen friendly (not too much of a problem as the film is only 1.77:1 but still a lazy oversight) and includes some better than usual on-set interviews with the director, cast and the author of the novel Jean-Francois Deniau, who throws some light on the real life figures (and there were plenty of Albert Dehousses in post-war France it seems) that inspired the film.",
         "Impostors and make-believes have always been favorites of story tellers all over the globe, and there are quite a few movies about them. This biopic/mockumentary (with old war veteran's interviews!) is one of the very best, and you enjoy wondering how much truth is in the story long after the movie is over. I guess quite much of it. The \"hero\" of the story is a very endearing person. The viewer gets to know him as a boy who grows up in fairly conventional circumstances. From the earliest days he lives between reality and fantasy. His acting out adventure stories he had read by himself in his small room in the attic is moving, it reminded me of my own childhood. The \"hero\" is naive and shrewd at the same time, and his rising in the military hierarchy of post war France as an alleged resistance hero is a fairy tale you can believe very easily. The hero's downfall is at first sight tragic but, on second thought, might also have been carefully planned by him. Well, he lived on happily ever after, they say. The acting is very good, Mathieu Kassovitz proves to be an excellent performer who brings the ambiguity in the hero's character to life and gives him credibility, the child actor who plays the hero as a boy is equally convincing. Some secondary parts are worth remembering: There is a very non-stereotypical homosexual, a French army officer who makes a pass at the \"hero\" and, as there is no response to his advances, starts a lasting platonic friendship with him, teaching him in a fatherly way in the art of make believe. After becoming an officer of the secret service, the \"hero\" is transferred to Germany. There he resides in a spacious palace, waited on by an old uniformed German butler. Movie buffs will possibly recognize it as a parody of Erich von Stroheim in Renoir's \"La Grande Illusion\" (he teaches the socially unexperienced \"hero\" the waltz). The movie is so good, I expect to see an American remake in the near future. To whoever will try to tackle the subject transatlantically, I recommend Preston Sturges' \"Hail the Conquering Hero!\".",
         "Set in the period before, during and just after WWII, Jacques Audiard's brilliant and witty satire is about a compulsive impostor, Albert Dehousse, who so successfully convinces the French authorities that he fought in the resistance that he is made an officer in the army occupying Germany. It is not the easiest of viewing for non-French speakers who have to follow the sub-titles, but is well worth the trouble. The movie's timeframe flashes back and forward; and director Jacques Audiard tells the story via a number of different devices, including normally acted sequences, voice-over, mock documentary interviews, newsreel footage, and even shots of the orchestra playing the background music. Mathieu Kassowitz portrays adult Albert as someone who is superficially engaging, but is empty inside, and has to consciously learn and then act out almost every gesture or emotional response. Like the film, Albert consists of disparate fragments, skillfully edited together into a convincing whole. There is probably a pointed message here for the movie's home audience, about the way France as a whole has exaggerated WWII resistance, and swept collaboration under the carpet. But the film raises general questions about how we play roles and falsify our past histories in everyday life; it also reminds us that impostors, including some so-called celebrities, depend on our gulliblity for their success.",
         "This film is a true masterpiece. The character delineation of our hero and how he gets there is true comedy at its best. Great comedy not only makes us laugh but makes us reflect on human life at the same time. This film does that. We get a satire on recent French history and well as the mores of the society. There are so many scenes where one knows that only a French film could be made this way. This film is even better than Mr. Audiard's marvelous film \"Read My Lips.\" The acting is superb and the script flawless. Do yourself a favor and rent this.",
         "Sweeping tale of a smart and lucky imposter, masterfully played by Mathieu Kassovitz during most of the movie. This combines short real footages with great acting all around. David Fernandes is touching as the young Albert, Jean-Louis Trintignant is perfect casting as the older/narrator. An unforgettable movie. Have to see it to believe it. Perfect script. Once again a wonderful movie that did not get the respect, publicity, \"fame\" it fully deserves. See this!",
         "Intelligent, droll, well made study of one man remaking himself as a hero under the cover of war. Poses interesting questions about identity and truth, and how we all invent ourselves. Some terrific cinematography, and a solid lead performance by Mathieu Kassovitz. However, something was missing for me emotionally. Sometimes the ideas seemed heavy handed, and other times, motives and characters underdeveloped. However, enough smart critics and viewers saw this as a near-masterpiece, that I'd be open to taking another look.",
         "I'm not normally a fan of foreign films, mainly because my lack of reading ability, but Un Heros Tres Discret (A.K.A. A Self Made Hero) was one of the best foreign films I have ever seen, if only because it introduced me to French actor, Mathieu Kassovitz. This movie, directed by Jacques Audiard, deals with Mathieu's character, Albert Dehousse, and his rise from a son living under his mother's insanity to becoming a leader of a French Revolutionary faction. If there is anything to praise this movie for, it's for the strong, yet understated performance by Kassovitz",
         "Original in its subject (the story is about a fake hero in the Second World War, but it deals too with the way we all build our everyday masking personality in front of the society)and its form (the film is structured as a mock documentary), \"A self-made hero\" contains lots of irony and a great performance of Kassovitz. However, even though it didn't want to be a thriller, the plot needed more tension and unfortunately lacks of it. We rarely have the feeling that the main character is going to be discovered and due to that some twists aren't believable at all."
