         "This is one of the best crime comedies out there, and when you take the whole sequels that followed it into consideration, it might be *the* best crime comedy ever. The (mis)adventures of Egon Olsen and his (in)famous gang may not be for everyone's liking, but they definitely come close. If you ever liked even a single crime comedy, you should get a hold of this movie ASAP. This may be troublesome particularly for US viewers, but it's worth a try.",
         "It's a milestone in Denmark. One of the most popular (if not the most popular) series of movies here. Everybody knows Olsen-Banden, young and old. Everybody can hum the theme, I'm sure. And even better; Olsen-Banden is a local-movie (all of them really), as it's set in Valby, which is just a few kilometers from here. Of course it can't be compared to some of the serious movies from Denmark in recent years, but this was the way we made movies back then. Now, the production company (Nordisk Film) has just released the first four movies on DVD recently, and the rest are to follow. And it was about time, if you ask me! So what better time to write about the movie than now? I'm not that crazy about this first movie. I can't deny that it all started with this one, so it's got my respect. Egon Olsen's got a plan, and it's a good plan. The plan is to steal a German piece of art displayed at a Danish museum. It's not as easy as it would sound, since this piece of art is secured by the most modern anti-theft devices, and a direct alarm to the police. So of course the details has to be carefully planned at first. The only problem is that Egon's surrounded by amateurs and idiots. Anyway, typical Danish comedy-style of its time, though a bit weak, as the insults and characters ain't fully developed in this first movie. I'd recommend movie 3-13 of the series instead, as they're much more enjoyable. \"Sir, jeg vil gerne reportere at... SIR, NU KOMMER DER ET TOG!\" \"Sir, I'd like to report that... SIR, INCOMING TRAIN!\" The enjoyable scene where Hr. Mortensen is trying to report back to his chief in a phone-booth, and a lone train-wagon derails and smashes into the phone-booth and his car.",
         "From the first movie, this series had not completely found its tone yet, but it's excellent and certainly fits in with the others. Yvonne has three children here, and from the second one only one, so they've changed the structure a bit there. Also this first movie has some porn in it which was toned down in later entries to make it more family-friendly. But the plot in this first movie is great. As in the other movies, we have a great chase after a treasure. Egon has a \"plan\", the music is there, and the action takes right on. Actually, one should watch all 13 from 1968-1981 since they are connected. Number 14 was perhaps not so successful though. Anyway, this is one of best comedies ever made, and it is really worth watching for all fans of movies.",
         "...though not delightful, yet! These rather humble beginnings mark the start of Denmark's most beloved movie series. This one's quite lame despite some funny scenes. The characters were still to be rounded out and the plots would become more elaborate and even mildly satirical in the later stages. But the comic interplay between the amiable leads already works and the tone of silent era style slapstick and caper high jinks provides a solid foundation for future episodes. And compared to, say, the German farces of the same time, it's never embarrassing. 4 out of 10 smashed phone-booths",
         "Watching this is kind of like watching a drawing by Picasso from his childhood... or a home video shot by Stanley Kubrick. Arguably the greatest Danish series of the comedy genre, the films about The Olsen Gang have entertained countless people in many countries... as my father informed me, the former Eastern Germany found it delightful, as it mocked authority(it was permitted by the censors, due to Denmark being a (primarily) capitalistic system). Actually, when they translated the films(by dubbing, as Germany and France are two of the only countries to possess too much arrogance and pride over their language to learn any other, including English), they had to cut out the character of Yvonne... as they simply could not find a German actress to match her. That says something about the energetic and hilarious performance she brings to each of the films(apart from the very last... as she had unfortunately passed away, which was one of the main reasons that it was delayed so many years... and was pitifully awful of a movie by most standards). The actors, basic plot progression, even the theme was in place, right here, from the beginning... it just wasn't as refined as it got to be, through the series. Much of it is just dreadful; the humor is silly and mostly stays at the level of the common denominator(though there are some traces of the satire and social commentary of the later films, as well as the human touch, the small details apparent in most of the films). The acting is incredibly overdone in most cases... even in that of Poul Reichchardt, a seasoned veteran within the art of acting, renowned not only for his film work, but for his many plays in The Danish Royal Theater. The plot is all over the place... for an 80-minute film(most of the later films reach over 100 minutes), it's got more mix-ups and complications than most films of three or four hours. In spite of its almost insipid, uninspired simplicity, it's almost difficult to follow, and far harder to recall. The pace is almost constantly, insistingly off... as if the film doesn't know when to move, where it's going... or how to get there. Some scenes consist entirely of jokes, and many of these are of a comic, cartoony nature... the \"gang\" survive a major blast from explosives, to give a brief example. Anyone who's seen the film will most likely grant that the last few scenes of the film are just about impossible to take seriously. Then there are all the quips(though, admittedly, some are somewhat funny) at porno, and the diverse reactions towards it(at the time, just before it was released, the issue of it was heavily debated)... all in all, this film is just very much a sign of its time. It was made to appeal to the masses, and this is what Danes preferred back then... silly, mindless fun. It wasn't until a few films later that this series really started to become sophisticated. But that doesn't mean that this film should be forgotten; apart from of course an excellent window into the world view of the Denmark of the late 60's, this film should be watched simply to see the roots of this grand series. Most of what people remember of all the good films of the franchise starts here... it may not be as refined or well-executed as it got to be, but it's still there. The walk of the gang, Yvonne's rants, Egon's impassioned speech to Benny and Kjeld, the very first heist of the film which is always destined to go wrong(one might add that the visual of the three, as we first see them, might have been better saved for a later film, or at least a later moment in this one, as it would have a more humorous effect, once the audience were used to the sight of the three as they usually look)... it started here. It has been said that the most important step of the journey is the first... and while this is arguably (among) the least memorable or entertaining of the steps that is the journey of this series, it is still that vitally important first one. Without this, the world would never have known The Olsen Gang. For that alone, it has my respect. Starting with the next movie, there are changes made. The series heads towards grandeur... slowly, perhaps, but it makes it. I recommend this film to any fan of Danish cinema and The Olsen Gang. If you don't know any of the other films of the series(this wasn't the first I saw; this wasn't where my interest in the franchise begun), I suggest you either look for the good, funny things in this(since they all reappear, many of them done far better, in the later films) or give one of the later films(starting around number 5, \"Runs Amok\") a chance before or after watching this. There is somewhat little in the way of overall plot throughout the series(though I advise making sure you see at least one other film before \"Runs Amok\", and make sure you don't start with one of the (2? I think) \"Gang\" films that start at their holiday destination(any real fan of these films will be able to answer that off the top of their head, and anyone who isn't should find out from the films and not this review). Not an exemplary start, but does show some promise, evidence of things to come. 6/10"
