      "synopsis": "Frank Drebin (Nielsen) has retired from police work and lives a basically happy life with his wife Jane (Presley). It remains \"basically happy\" because police work has been Frank's meaning of life, and he feels unhappy about not being able to legally take on criminals anymore. Additionally, Jane tries to push him into siring a child, but Frank does not have the courage to go through this yet. It comes as a blessing to him when his old friends Ed Hocken (Kennedy) and Nordberg (Simpson) come by and ask for his help in an investigation. The Police Squad has caught wind that a well-known bomber named Rocco Dillon (Ward), who is currently incarcerated, has been hired by a terrorist (Papshmir, known from the first movie) to conduct a major terrorist act against the United States. An important contact, Tanya Peters (Smith), Rocco's girlfriend, proves to be a dead end, so Drebin is asked to join Dillon undercover in prison, befriend him, and then leak details of the plan to his colleagues. However, the first part of the mission - by pure accident - proves to be extremely taxing; Jane becomes frustrated both at Frank's sudden unwillingness to engage in his marital duties and the suspicion that he is doing police work again, and storms out of the house. Frank joins Rocco in prison, and after winning his trust, the two stage their breakout together. Rocco even manages to persuade his dominant and highly distrustful mother Muriel (Freeman) to take Frank into their house. However, both are loth to tell Frank too many details right away, which is why he is forced to stay around a little longer. In the meantime, Jane joins her friend Louise on a wild road trip, but in time she realizes that she really misses Frank. When she returns and finds him missing, she follows a clue Frank had inadvertently left behind to Tanya, where she is promptly taken hostage by Rocco and his mother. Frank is barely able to save her life for the time being, and eventually Rocco reveals his plan: the bomb is to be set off at this year's Academy Award ceremony, with the bomb hidden in the envelope with the nomination of Best Actress and triggered when the card is pulled out. At the awarding night, Frank and Jane separate from Rocco's team and frantically begin searching for the bomb, with Frank inflicting his usual chaos onstage during the prelude show. They are, however, unable to find the bomb before the nomination for Best Actress is begun. When Frank bursts onto the stage and awkwardly attempts to prevent the detonation of the bomb, Rocco and his mother realize what's going on and take Jane hostage, but in the process Frank loosens an electronic sign which takes out Muriel. Desperate, Rocco decides to detonate the bomb to follow his mother, but Frank manages to catapult him and the bomb out of the awarding hall right into Papshmir's private plane (which was circling overhead), with the bomb eliminating all hostile parties involved. Frank and Jane reaffirm their love under the applause of the awarding audience and viewers worldwide. About nine months later, Frank and Nordberg rush into the pedriatic ward to witness the birth of Frank's child - only that a slight mistake ends with Frank being very resentful at Nordberg ...",

         "It's rare for a cop movie to combine elements from \"The Untouchables\", \"Thelma & Louise\" and \"The Brady Bunch\". Unless, of course, the lead character has a tendency to run his car into parking meters. \"The Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult\" brings the lofty trilogy to a close with the same old cast (Kennedy, Simpson, Presley) and slapstick antics involving a prison breakout, terrorist plot and the Oscars. And there in the center is Lt. Frank Drebin (Nielsen) on the verge of retirement and fighting with bad guys, shopping carts and Weird Al Yankovic while trying convince lovely wife Jane (Presley) that the spark in their relationship is still there. How can you talk down a movie like this; it's as useless as putting up a tent in a windstorm, so they say. You have to enjoy stupidity, one-liners, gags and visual puns, as created by the ZAZ boys (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker) and delivered by a cast of pros (including Fred Ward and Pia Zadora!!), all with the tone of adolescence and insanity you've come to know and love. And if you don't, why are you reading this? Kudos go to Anna Nicole Smith, who makes her debut in movies here in a big way (sorry) and shows she is at her best when laughing at herself. Good job, Anna. Favorite scene? I lost count after the first 10 minutes; it's an exercise in futility, every scene will make you chuckle, laugh, guffaw, roar and/or howl with delight. Besides, why spoil the fun? And as for Nielsen...as always, he is THE MAN! Even when throwing up in a tuba. Ten stars for a great \"Final\" trip down into Dumbville. And one star more for the very last scene - classic! Thanks, Frank.",
         "Retirement has not been good for Frank Drebin. His marriage is on the rocks and he feels emasculated as he no longer has the power of the law or the ability to shot bad guys. When he is offered the chance to help out with some undercover work, Frank jumps at the chance \u0096 even though Jane storms out. When the info Frank finds points to imprisoned bomb expert Rocco Dillon he agrees to go into the jail and infiltrate his gang in order to find out his plan. Despite the fact that the second part was a little bit of a dip from part 1, Debin was brought back for a final insult and managed to produce a very enjoyable conclusion to the series. Opening with one of the best moments from all three films (a hilarious expansion of The Untouchable train station scene) the film keeps up a very consistent tone that has plenty of big laughs as well as lots of little things that will keep you chuckling. Its not that the film has no misses (it does) but they are covered by the sheer weight of hits that it includes. The plot is fairly simple but is well done to include a few basic set ups \u0096 the prison, the break out and the Oscars; each part is very funny if you're in the mood for it and, hey, even if you're not it is pretty infectious. The writing is good \u0096 it is easy to forget how hard it is to write a good spoof, but recent attempts have shown had easy it is to misjudge the film and just be silly rather than funny. Another big part of the film working is yet another great performance from Leslie Neilsen, who makes it all look so easy! Ward is a great addition to the cast and is much better than the bad guy from the second film \u0096 Ward plays it gruff and straight, making it all the funnier. Presley is so-so, with her character kind of shoe-horned into the film to her detriment, but she does have some good moments. Freeman is good value and Smith, well, Smith has a good body and that's about it \u0096 but fair play to her for sending herself up like that, it's not like she needed the money after all. Overall, this is a very enjoyable film as long as you are in the mood. Even if you aren't roaring with laughter you'll still be chuckling along. The material is hardly the height of wit or intelligence and some viewers may find it to be all a bit broad but fans of the genre will love it and get plenty of laughs from the material and the mostly good performances.",
         "The third and final installment and best of the Naked Gun series features Lt. Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) talked out of retirement to track down a terrorist who bombed a city hall building. First Drebin must go undercover in state prison then after escaping Rocco Dillon (Fred Ward) plans on bombing the Academy Awards you bet Frank and the police squad to the rescue no matter how comical. The laughs just keep coming with this film! The Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult showed that films have parody, films throughout the years can become copycats except scenes are different with parody. Prime example is at the beginning of the film when the famous stair scene with the babies and the mob from the \"Untouchables\" is portrayed in a humorous manner. In fact parody is present in the opening credits in the form of Star Wars and Jurassic Park. Slapstick comedy mirrors almost every scene of this film as every funny and even the serious moments involve horseplay of some kind. And the dialogue is just as funny as can be these Naked Gun characters try to make everything they say twisted to where it sounds just as funny as possible. Leslie Nielsen is the funniest man ever in comedy films every scene he does cracks me up! George Kennedy and O.J. Simpson are nice funny sidekicks to Nielsen once again the casting of them both paid off they always made the Naked Gun films a pleasure to watch. 1993 Playmate of the year Anna Nicole Smith has better than average acting abilities and why she doesn't act more is a mystery to me she added a certain needed sex appeal to the final Naked Gun. I hate Paramount finally done away with the Naked Gun movies I hope to see another one made. Buy or record this one it simply is one of the funniest movies of all time it's sad in a way the series ended I know I laugh and enjoy this film so much I just had to record it and add to my video collection, like me you will watch it again and again for the many laughs and stupid mishaps.",
         "I have to say that this is one of the greatest comedy trilogies I have ever seen. Leslie Neilson has never stopped with the laughter and his fearless performance as Frank. Presilla does a fantastic job and her Thelma and Louise with Ellen Green was just memorable and fun to watch. OJ Simpson, the \"downfall\" I like to call it, because three months later came the murder trials. Anna Nicole Smith was actually amusing in this film, I loved the crying game parody. There are a lot of great spoofs and jokes in the film. I think anyone who needs a good laugh or loves the Naked Gun movies should watch 33 1/3, it's just guaranteed of a good time. 8/10",
         "I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The film is entirely fun and you cant stop laughing at the silly things that happen in the movie. Though it gets a little boring for a short while, overall the movie is a blast. The scenes are executed well. The Hollywood spoof of the movie was just fun and rocking. Anna Nicole Smith is amazing in her sex appeal and has done justice to her part. The actors have done their part well and the movie entertains you completely. Though the jokes are silly and not realistic, a movie is to entertain and this justifies its purpose. A nice watch over a Saturday afternoon.",
         "Now former Lieutenant Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) has a tough time that he is not working with the Police Squad anymore and his wife Jane (Priscilla Presley) is now an lawyer. Although she wants a baby, he has a tough time getting her pregnant. His former partners (Oscar-Winner:George Kennedy and O.J. Simpson) wants Frank to spy on Tanya Peters (The late Anna Nicole Smith), since Tanya is involved with a hired bomb expert Rocco Dillon (Fred Ward). Which Dillon is in prison, at first Frank was supposed to get her address but he lost it. When Jane leaves him, thinking that Frank was fooling around with another woman. Frank decides to go undercover as a prisoner to get closer on Dillon. Frank knows that Dillon is planning to destroy and kill many of innocent people for a price but where ? Directed by Peter Segal (The Nutty Professor 2:The Klumps, Anger Management, Tommy Boy) made an entertaining spoof comedy, based on the short-lived TV series back in the early 1980's. Nielsen is always an hoot in the lead. The cast seems to be having an great time. Although the reviews were mixed and at the box office was less promising than the first two but still, this was an major success on video. There's some lively cameos throughout the feature. If you are fan of these type of silly comedies or \"The Naked Gun\" movies, you will certainly enjoy it. Written by Pat Proft (The Naked Gun:From the Files of Police Squad!, Hot Shots! Part Deux, Scary Movie 3 & 4), David Zucker (An American Carol, High School High, Top Secret!) and Robert LoCash (CB4). (****/*****).",
         "I thought this one was almost as good as the first film and a bit better than the second one. I liked the whole infiltration of the prison plot and the retirement aspect of the film more than all the politics of the second film. However, Leslie plays Drebin in a bit more of a goofy fashion this go around. There are also other things in this film that were not really in the first two installments like the scenes that parodied other movies. Scenes like these were not in the first two movies, from what I remember anyway, but there are a couple of them in this one. Such as the opening which parodies \"The Untouchables\" and a \"Thelma and Louise\" one as well. However, the film has a nice conclusion at the academy awards which makes fun of Hollywood's biggest night in grand fashion. The plot has Frank retired, but he is coaxed out of retirement to break into a prison and find out a sinister plot. The villain this time is Fred Ward and he is good as is his gang. There are some surprises here and there too. I just thought this one was a bit more humorous than two, but not quite on par with the first one. Close, but not quite.",
         "So, here we are then, with the third part of the very silly 'Naked Gun' series. For some reason, David Zucker isn't in the director's chair this time; and his replacement is the man who would go on to direct the 2004 disappointment '50 First Dates' a decade later; Peter Segal. This doesn't matter, though, because Zucker still shares a writing credit, and the series always belonged to Leslie Nielson anyway. Still, this third part isn't as good as the first two, by quite a margin. The story is less expansive this round, and the film is also a lot shorter (probably a comment on the fact that the writers were running out of ideas...), but it still has it's moments that are really funny. As usual, quite a few of the jokes don't work, but there's usually one that does just around the corner after a failed one. One sequence in particular involving Frank Drebin in a dance number is one such moment. The thin plot is mostly a parody on the crime classic 'White Heat', and it involves Frank Drebin going undercover in jail and eventually having to try and thwart an act of terrorism. Naturally, this is just a springboard for lots and lots of gags, but that's no bad thing. Leslie Nielson approaches the role with the usual gusto, and does well with it again. Leslie Nielson's comedy works because he looks so ridiculous, and he can just stand around doing nothing and make you laugh. The Naked Gun series is a good waste of time if all you want is a laugh and this second sequel delivers on that front too, although not in quite as good a way as the first two did. Still, there's a lot worse comedies around.",
         "'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult', the third and final film in the Naked Gun series, is a hilarious slapstick fare, where it's lead star, the late Hollywood Legend, Leslie Nielsen, proves once again, that he is an unstoppable/unforgettable talent. 'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult' Synopsis: Frank Drebin comes out of retirement to help Police Squad infiltrate a gang of terrorists planning to detonate a bomb at the Academy Awards. 'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult' is a faithful & satisfying sequel. It raises a lot of laughs, especially in the climax, the entire Academy-Awards Sequence, which is absolutely hilarious. Pat Proft, David Zucker & Robert LoCash's Screenplay is genuinely funny & extremely arresting. Peter Segal Directs this slapstick comedy, decently. Cinematography & Art Design, are worth a mention. Performance Wise: Nielsen, as mentioned before, is unstoppable in here. The legendary actor delivers a laugh-out-loud performance, and holds the film from start to end. Priscilla Presley supports well. George Kennedy is excellent. O.J. Simpson is fair. Fred Ward & Kathleen Freeman are passable. Others lend support. On the whole, 'Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult' is slapstick comedy at its best.",
         "Unlike the first Naked gun movie, produced in 1988, (Jim Abrahams) and (Jerry Zucker) weren't part of the writing this round, leaving (Pat Proft) and (David Zucker) alone in preparation of going solo afterwards. I felt that that left its bad mark here, where the movie was all about 2 acts only : getting to the bomb expert, then that expert's job at the Oscars ! Speaking about problems; true that the atmosphere was dynamically ironic, but the cast somewhat wasn't as dynamic. For instance (Leslie Nielson) seemed less energetic with obviously sick voice for most of the time, (George Kennedy) was almost having a paralysis. Not to mention the absence of many cameos, especially with the idea of parodying the Oscar night. Aside from the charming flavor of having these stars on screen, their presence assures the movie's conscience as a parody for flaws everybody admits. Away from that; there were many clever scenes (the parody of The Untouchables, the scene of the wife leaving the house..), and many clever lines (I used to be white ! / Yeah, I remember the Osmonds !). It reached the top during the Oscar night sequence, which is a classic act I can't get enough of despite numerous times of watching. Knowing that I write this in 2012, you must notice that the direction was smart and vivid. The pace was fine, without dragging on with one sequence pointlessly. How creative before how funny the laughs were, since they didn't incline totally to for instance the toilet humor, the fart jokes. And, most importantly, look at things like the characters' problems and solutions; the lead's wife wants to have a baby, but he has no capacity since leaving the police force, therefore his return will provide finally the self-respect he lost and needs. OH MY GOD. Back then, making a parody didn't mean being an idiot as a director or writer yet! Watch all of (Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer) recent spoofs to understand that better, and to cherish this movie, along with its era, more and more. It's an entertaining comedy, but more short and less full than its 2 antecedents. It marks the start of the end of the parody movie's golden age; the age which began with (Airplane! \u0096 1980) by (Jim Abrahams), (Jerry Zucker), (David Zucker) and (Pat Proft) \"who had special thanks credit in that movie\". One of the end's reasons is the breakup of that golden team. After the departure of (Jim Abrahams) and (Jerry Zucker), (Pat Proft) and (David Zucker) would go to play solo as well. Sorrowfully not a good thing for them, or us, as it turned out to be. Because next movies like Jane Austen's Mafia!, BASEketball, Wrongfully Accused, and Scary Movie 3 don't stand comparison to the insanity, precision, and movie culture of one Naked Gun movie. P.S : the Arab is always a terrorist in Hollywood movies ?? It's almost like how the Afro-American was always a servant in old Hollywood movies ! While that attitude became old itself, why the Arab status doesn't get old at all ?!"
