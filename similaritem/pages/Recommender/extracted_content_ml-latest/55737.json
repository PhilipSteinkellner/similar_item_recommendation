      "synopsis": "On a routine flight from Los Angeles to Paris, a renegade group of scientists has smuggled aboard a secret container holding a fellow scientist infected with a deadly genetically engineered virus which reanimates the dead. The virus is a variant of the Malaria virus, created by three scientists. They discovered and manufactured the virus with the intent of turning it into a biological weapon. Their goal was to produce soldiers who could continue fighting, even while mortally wounded. The virus is transmitted through bodily fluids. The infected have superhuman abilities, sprinting and leaping beyond human capabilities. The zombies become very durable, and one particular zombie survives despite being thrown into a plane's engine. The 747 jumbo jet encounters massive thunderstorms, and the turbulence releases the scientist from the cargo hold. A guard assigned to her kills her with an MP-5, when she re-animates and attacks and kills him, turning him into a zombie. Two of the scientists go below to ascertain if the container has been damaged by the turbulence, and are also killed, starting a zombie outbreak. They then attack several passengers in the cabin, and an epidemic of the undead begins. The uninfected passengers must now fight for survival aboard the flight. No government will allow the infected airliner to land, leaving the survivors stranded in the sky with their ravenous tormentors. Ultimately a golf pro (Billy), his wife (Anna), a cop (Burrows), a con artist (Frank), an Air Marshal (Paul) and a stewardess (Megan) are all that are left of the uninfected people. They must make their way to the cockpit and signal a fighter jet behind them that there are still living people aboard the 747 or the fighter will destroy them. After managing to get an MP-5 from the dead guard, Burrows, Frank and Billy make their way from the tail of the plane to the cockpit. Billy is bitten but manages to kill the zombie. Anna rushes to help while Paul holds off the infected in the back. Unfortunately, while fighting in close quarters, Anna is also bitten. She manages to kill the infected by stabbing an umbrella through its mouth and out the back of its head, but realizes she will shortly die and reawaken. She and Billy back up against an exit door and when he runs out of ammo they open it, sucking themselves and several zombies out of the plane to their apparently final deaths. Frank and Burrows make it to the cockpit where Frank kills the zombie copilot, and the two of them try to get the plane off autopilot and signal the fighter which fires at them. They're ultimately successful and waggle the plane's wings, alerting the fighter. The fighter pilot hits the abort key and the missile explodes away from the 747, but close enough to the plane to open a hole in the side. All the zombies are apparently sucked out. Frank and Burrows try to control the plane, but hit a mountain and crash land near Las Vegas. During the crash the pilot is reanimated and attacks them but Burrows manages to blow his head off with the MP-5. Megan, Paul, Frank and Burrows all survive and make their way towards the city, but after they leave its revealed that four zombies survived as well. The movie ends with the zombies shambling towards the city.",

         "This demented and adorably over-the-top gory zombie flick was presented and introduced here at the Belgian Horror & Fantasy Festival by its writer/creator Scott Thomas. He claims that, in spite of all the obvious plot-similarities with \"Snakes on a Plane\", his film is definitely NOT a quick cash-in on the huge success of the 2006 summer-blockbuster and that the basic concept and the pre-production phase of \"Plane Dead\" actually predate \"Snakes on a Plane\". Well, I don't know if all that is true, but I tend to believe Thomas because he's such a nice guy and he seemed very confident. Moreover, even if \"Plane Dead\" simply was a rip-off of the popular Sam L. Jackson hit, I still wouldn't care that much, because it's such a tremendously entertaining and enthusiast splatter-flick! As long as you don't expect new and groundbreaking story lines and/or highly intellectual dialogs, \"Plane Dead\" honestly can't fail to amuse you. In most departments, it's even far better and more appealing to horror fanatics than \"Snakes on a Plane\", because it's a lot faster, cheesier, gorier and shamelessly features all the standard clichÃ©s us genre fans love so much. Safely protected in the cargo-hold of the red-eye flight from L.A. to Paris, a mysterious scientific experiment is transported out of the US by its malicious creators. The unscrupulous Dr. Leo Bennett and his loyal researchers developed a virus that rapidly destroys human DNA, only to revive the infected victim again as a bloodthirsty and unstoppable zombie. He plans to sell his formula to the military in order to create the ultimate soldier, of course, but some unanticipated turbulence and noisy passengers on the 747-flight cause the female \"test-case\" zombie to resurrect a little early, and she immediately begins to feast her way through crew and passengers. Once bitten, the victim turns into a zombie as well, and pretty soon the plane is overrun by seemingly more zombies than there were passengers in the first place. It perhaps takes slightly too long before the zombies run loose on the plane, but when they do \"Plane Dead\" turns into a non-stop series of laughs, creative deaths and extreme gore. Apparently, only stereotypes were allowed aboard this flight and it's always a lot of fun to watch those getting killed off one by one. Naturally it's the elderly pilot's last flight before retirement, there's the heroic copper ï¿½ who eventually has to save the day - transporting a witty criminal, arguing teen couples, sexy yet empty-headed stewardesses, couples with marriage issues and Tiger Woods' biggest competitor himself! The gore is guaranteed to please people, as the script features several ingenious new methods to kill zombies, like an umbrella through the head, nine-iron golf clubs and of course airplane engines. Be honest, what would you rather get face-to-face with whilst stuck in an inescapable location: ordinary snakes, albeit a little venomous ... or filthy, virulent, ravenous and outrageous zombies? There are quite a few recognizable faces in the cast, like Kevin J. O'Connor (the creep from \"Lord of Illusions\" and \"Deep Rising\"), Erick Avari and Richard Tyson. The lines and characters are often very funny, the make-up effects are delightfully campy in an old-fashioned way and there even is an occasional moment of genuine suspense. \"Plane Dead\" is awesome horror-entertainment and I hope Scott Thomas will enjoy the success he deserves with it.",
         "I will never understand the haters of the zombie genre. Just like romantic comedy these gems are not made for everyone. The few people who appreciate a good zombie movie will see the originality and joy in this movie. Granted it is not scary..AT ALL and it isn't nearly gory enough, but still this movie deserves its due. It took a concept that has been done to death, people locked in a confined area fighting back a zombie invasion...(Night of the Living Dead being the blueprint) and gave it a twist that I really appreciated. Being trapped in a confined space with the Zombies, leaving you with zero room to hide and none of that long drawn out psychological mind-screw most films rely on to kill time. I loved this movie, and if you love zombie flicks, I'm sure you will too.",
         "I didn't know ANYTHING about this movie until last night. Expected a crappy low budget ripoff of \"Snakes on a Plane\". But since this was made BEFORE \"Snake\" I guess it's the other way around ;) Well as I said I expected a crappy movie in the Sci-Fi Channel mold. But what I got was an EXTREMELY entertaining action/horror that puts this Zombie flick on the same top 10 list as Rodrigues \"Planet Terror\". Sure it's a low budget movie but I doesn't feel like it. I would gladly have paid for a ticket to seen it on the big screen. Now THIS is how you make use of a limited budget. We got HUGE amounts of Zombies and gore (okey not like Planet Terror but plenty enough) and lot's of action and explosions, especially in the last half hour. What I also liked was the characters. Usually in low budget movies we get the most crappiest and annoying actors on the planet, but in this one they can ACTUALLY act, and most of them are likable as well. Not unlike Snakes on a Plane where you HATED them all ;) The Zombie make-up FX were brilliant and they were the crazy brutal type of zombies as in the remake of Dawn of the Dead. They actually made me jump a few times as well. Now THAT doesn't happen to often ;) Except for a few CGI shots this have the look and feel of a real theater movie. Shame it went the Direct to Video route with a crappy cover. This is a movie that deserves an following. So look it up folks. It's a classic :)",
         "Can't believe a previous poster is nit-picking over firing machine guns on planes/decompression etc - It's a ZOMBIE flick, not a documentary FFS! in other words, the filmmakers have decided to diverge somewhat from reality. Go watch this - it's a fantastic mixture of zombie and air-plane disaster film. It'll give you a few frights, loads of laughs and that's more than a lot of other films. If you're looking for the perfect film to see with your friends & choke on your popcorn - this is the baby! Just don't expect it to turn up anytime soon as an in-flight movie, OK...",
         "If you're a zombie fan, this is worth watching, but it's not one of those gems, like Undead or Dead Meat, that you could watch again and again. Ideal for a good one-night rental. There are tons of really awful zombie flicks out there, with stupid dialogue, bad acting, and even worse makeup and F/X. Then there are the few really awesome offerings, that just hit on all cylinders, and keep you on the edge of your seat and begging for more. This movie is neither. It's truly not a bad movie, either in the general sense, or simply as a zombie flick. In fact, it's actually kinda fun. The worst thing going for it is simply that it's virtually impossible to come up with anything new, since it's all been done before, so you can't help but make comparisons. Had most of the events we see in this movie not been seen before in some guise, this would probably be considered a keeper. But, since we have seen it all before, it's important to ask yourself one, simple question: Did I enjoy myself while watching this. And the answer is yes. It's true that there are slightly campy moments. It's true that there are back-to-back scenes where in one someone hears a distant moan, but in the next doesn't hear gunfire from the same location. It's true that some of the dialogue is cheesy, and you feel the pain of the seasoned pro doing his best to recite them without feeling silly. Nevertheless, if you just allow yourself to sit back and be drawn-in to the story, and can sustain a little suspension of disbelief without falling back on the tried-n-true (albeit fun) habit of nitpicking every little mistake and silly bit, I really think you'll enjoy yourself, and can kill and hour-and-a-half that you may never get back, but won't mind losing. :)",
         "\"Flight of the Living Dead\" is a decent take on the Zombie genre that kept me on the edge of the seat for the full running time. It stands out because it presents you with some things you don't expect from the average low-budget direct-to-video Zombie flick, i.e. a script that actually works, decent acting, neat make-up effects and even a nice score. What I liked about the plot: There's are rather long but surprisingly suspenseful introduction before it gets bloody. That part works because the writers use the time to introduce some well chosen stereotypes of characters that promise to be fun victims later on. There's the jock, his rich bitch girlfriend, the cute-but-stupid stewardess, the evil corporate guy and even a Tiger Woods look-kinda-alike, just to name a few. The movie also stays relatively plausible and plays coy before it kicks into high gear for the finale. It's a sudden and thoroughly enjoyable switch in tone. \"Flight of the Living Dead\" is no disguised comment on society but as far as zombie butcherfests go, this one is pretty nice. Not revolutionary film making, but rather competently executed gory fun. If you enjoyed the intro song and desperately tried to locate it without success: Take a look at the M*Space page of one Bill Grainer, the gentleman who wrote the song.",
         "it's not a \"hard zombie\" film, but yet it manages to have a few \"clever\" scenes while mixing along some humour (not always necessary, one must admit it), which makes this film enjoyable and pleasant to watch. the acting is fairly decent and well accomplished and the storyline, though not brilliant and all that elaborated. it still manages to keep the film from being yet another pretentious zombie production, producing good moments of solid action with a couple of more \"heavy/scary\" scenes, though i wouldn't quite call it a horror film. a good option to consider ;)",
         "I'll admit, I'm a zombie fan. This film's premise reminded me of one of the \"night of the living dead\" comic books that came out a while back. an infected passenger gets aboard a flight, which, when it lands, disgorges all of the now flesh-hungry passengers on an unsuspecting London. in this case, we get to see what happens in-between, while they're still in the air. lots of running, screaming, chomping and that great zombie hiss we all know so well. it's well-done, suspenseful and delightfully gory. for me, anyway, it blew \"snakes on a plane\" right out of the water. it was obviously done on a small budget, but there's not too much sign of that on-screen. the best bits: the zombie nun, and the hole that somehow gets ripped open between the cabin and the lower deck. i lost count of the number of people being dragged screaming into & then jumping out of that hole. nice twisty sort of ending, too. acting so-so, makeup FX above average. recommended highly.",
         "This is what \"Snakes on a Plane\" should have been. It is also what \"Citizen Kane\" should have been. I'm only halfway kidding. The story is very predictable and includes every clichÃ© I could ask for, but rather than making me groan, somehow it had me laughing out loud. I'm not sure how much of the humor is intentional, but some of it definitely is, and the film has a feeling overall kind of in between \"Army of Darkness\" and every PG-13 popcorn horror movie ever made. The look of the zombies is pretty much the same as all of the other new direct-to-video and made-for-TV zombies films, but somehow it feels just right here. The zombies are neither scary nor hypnotic, but they are very shootable, and when they get shot, it's a good feeling. Snap. I'm so tired, and I think this review is incoherent. My point is this: \"Plane Dead\" is a lot of fun, and a breath of fresh air for a genre that's getting suffocated by remakes and sequels that just miss the point.",
         "An obvious cash-in on the *Insert Monster Here* On A Plane gimmick, Flight Of The Living Dead is about what you'd expect it to be. The film has little or no plot, which is what you'd expect from a film of this type. Although, it is fun in parts, I must say. The Zombie-action is particularly entertaining. Once the film picks up, it never stops; the pacing is solid. The practical special effects are pretty good, but the CGI is terrible and distracting. The ending seems to leave the film open to a sequel. Let's hope that doesn't come to fruition. If you're a die-hard fan of the zombie sub-genre of horror films, I'd recommend it to you; it's worth at least one watch. However, if you're just an avid fan of the genre, leave it on the shelf. 3/10"
