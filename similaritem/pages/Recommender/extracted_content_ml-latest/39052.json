         "While rating this film I had to consider a few facts: It is a low-budget, do-it-yourself, fan-film. I could pick one of those perspectives and easily give it 10 stars but instead I will try to comment this film in light of any other movie since it really moves beyond those categories. I saw the trailer but the final movie was not what you might expect from that. Although it's a comedy, the movie takes itself seriously and doesn't take easy shortcuts in doing so with style. It takes time to introduce a bunch of interesting characters. After that the comedy was at it's best when it was driven by these eccentric characters. There were no normal people in this universe. There are great build-up's, the pacing works out pretty good and the space scenes don't overshadow the storytelling. When the CGI is on focus it's top quality visuals combined with an epic soundtrack. I do like a good space battle and the whole experience made my eyes glare with excitement. The main storyline would've worked without a few anecdote scenes but these scenes were so refreshing that it would have been a shame to receive a studio note to delete them. I welcomed every departure from the stale Hollywood formula with a smile. Acting was OK at best with a few mild exceptions in the smallest roles. Nothing that distracted from the storytelling. Jari Ahola was brilliant as the Security Chief Karigrandi and the performance of Fukov was great fun. I did wonder about what was the point of all. The lead character has a rather questionable morality and it felt a bit awkward at times. When the battles started I didn't know who to root for. Everyone suffers for their stupidity and the audience gets their laugh. Maybe the point is that \"the universe is fair and we might get what we deserve\". All in all I laughed out loud many times in a movie theater and that doesn't happen often. I cheered and clapped and felt happy to see a movie like this. It is quite exceptional on any scale. This was not the best Finnish movie ever but it was truly the most entertaining.",
         "No spoilers here :) A very funny and multi-layer film for the fan of science fiction. Nothing like this has ever been made in Finland, and this is bound to put Finland on the sci-fi -map. Some of the humor is very Finnish, a lot universal :) The structure of the film is nicely thought through and executed, with an ending that left me wondering if there is to be a sequel :) Considering that the actors excluding two or three if I am correct, were all amateurs, friends and volunteer fans, the movie was very skilfully over-acted and cast to the best possible Star Wreck -style. The actors were all charming and sure to win you over. To be noted that this is the 6th Star Wreck film made. The effects are excellent, the war scenes actually do work in spite of the comedy nature which is never made cliché or a boring repetition, a pitfall of many parodies. Two thumbs-up for the music as well. Hard to believe that this wasn't made by professionals. All in all, a well-made full-length feature film. Must-see for all sci-fi fans!",
         "So Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning is an amateur production. There isn't much in the film that betrays this \u0097 even most of the acting would fail to put a Hollywood B production into shame, and there are some brilliant cases of casting, and even a couple of superb actors. In the Pirkinning is above all an action-adventure film with seemingly big-budget special effects \u0097 except that the special effects budget is dirt cheap. It is also a fairly well working comedy \u0097 of the darker kind, with a touch of political satire and a heavy dose of teevee science fiction parody. Oh yeah, and it has scantily clad females on the bridge (but they have an EDGE!). There's something intangibly Finnish about all Finnish movies, and this one is no exception. I don't know if it is the language, or if it is the people, or if it is the landscape \u0097 perhaps it is all of them. This movie would look and sound very different had it been produced in just about any other country by people of any other nationality. Bizarrely, it also is, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made in Finland. (I'm sure some other people will disagree.) The movie is in Finnish. Although some of the jokes rather depend on understanding the Finnish language or the Finnish culture, they are in the minority, and most of the fun is universally understandable. Of course, a loyal teevee scifi fan will find a lot of extra laughs and recognize several subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) references to memorable shows and movies, often with a twist. In short, In the Pirkinning is Mel Brooks' Spaceballs with actual balls, Finnish style.",
         "I just returned from the first tour screening. The place was a small club at the heart of Turku, and built for bands to perform rather than a movie theater, but the mood was great. The crew introduced themselves, and were greeted with the traditional contained cheering. The movie started with elegant new title design and theme music, quality not one bit shy of a true professional movie. The movie was technically extremely well dome throughout the picture, not just on some money shots with garbage filler as often is the case with such films. Effects are top-notch, and post-processing is as good as DV can ever offer. Sound mix was good. Sometimes the dialogue got a bit muffled, but the rest of the soundtrack just boomed with POWER! You'll want a good audio set with this one. The story starts out a bit awkward as was expected, given that the heroes were stranded on the 21st century earth in the last movie. Things smooth out quickly, and the plot gets underway. The story takes twists from absurd to serious and back to absurd, but the plot stays coherent. The humor is all new, with lots of stuff mixed together. There are the usual low-brow jokes and Adam Sandler acts, then there is Buster Keaton / Harold Lloyd -esque slapstick and rather clever pokes at the various sci-fi franchises, as well as sci-fi in general. There is even a good measure of political satire thrown in. As a whole, the movie is more a black comedy. The pacing of the movie is really well done. There is no tarrying around, and the interest keeps on. There's no too much happening at the same time either. The balance is well kept. Acting was the most varied issue. There were few professional actors, even one superstar by local measure (Kari Väänänen), and their performance truly stood out. Quite some of the not-so-professional performances were quite enjoyable. There were no really terrible scenes, at worst the acting was OK. As many long-awaited movies have got over-hyped and then fallen flat, I had suppressed some of the hopes, but this movie really lives up to (and exceeds) any expectation I've had. The plot is NOT what you'd find in such a movie made in Hollywood; the humor is quite dark at times and silly at others, and the satire stings in every direction. If there was an 'european art movie' with Stuff! Blowing! Up! it would probably look like this movie. I give it a ****½/*****",
         "The trailer already whetted my appetite. But the movie itself is outstanding. If you are a fan of Star Trek, Babylon 5, etc you have probably also thought of some scenes you would like to see. For me this movie comes very close. The CGI effects can only be described as awesome. Every scene breathes the love of the staff for details. Especially the battle scenes are outstanding and give every Star Wars movie a run for its money. The plot is also masterly constructed. The tension builds up in the first twenty minutes or so and reaches several peaks after that. The story has a great tongue-in-cheek attitude. The characters are only slightly exaggerated compared to their respective originals which keeps them from getting on your nerves too fast. Fortunately the actors avoid overacting - which impressed me as this is still a fan movie after all. The only drawback is that the audio is Finish with English sub-titles. But what the heck: Hearing the tone of Pirk's derogatory remarks is compensation enough.",
         "I was very eager when I sat down to watch the movie, did it meet it's expectations or not? Well I'm eased to say it did, and with a long shot as well. The whole world domination thing with a comedical straw is brilliant and a bit goofy (as it should be). Well, what you say, be proud Finland, a very good comedy-parody production of a well known sci-fi series. And I'm sure both you and me sometimes had wondered what would happen if the time directive would have been broken, well you have the answer just right here :). Summary: A very well made Finnish movie that makes a laugh out of both the Babylon and the star trek series with a success. The special effects are good for a movie in this class, and the acting is very well done good as well. The whole making fun of the emperor thing is brilliant, and the relates to the time directive is good as well. The jokes are funny as well, so I enjoyed this movie very much and recommend it for every star trek and babylon5 fan out there. I give this 10/10 for as this isn't the ordinary Hollywood production and very much deserve it. Thank you Finland !",
         "Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning is (roughly) the seventh film in a series of Star Trek / science fiction spoof films, following the adventures of the space ship CPP Potkustartti. More than ten years after the first Star Wreck film which was nothing more than a few minutes of simple hand drawn computer animation plus some school boy humour spoken on top of it, In the Pirkinning is the culmination of the series. More than a five year mission, this film has been \"almost ready\" since the end of the last millennium, and is now finally shown to a delighted audience. And what a film it is! It really can be seen that this is a labour of love. While the acting is at time painfully amateurish, and while the plot is a bit too simplistic towards the end, the humour combined with references to Star Trek and Babylon 5 should keep any science fiction TV fan happy for the duration. And even acting can be forgiven when you consider that the actor budget has been a very round number with only one zero. The English and Swedish subtitles are very well done, particularly the latter one which manages to transfer a significant amount of finer Finnish language nuances. However the Swedish subs were not particularly well timed: Many of the longer lines started too early and disappeared too quickly to read. The only real gripe I have about this film is the constant swearing. Don't take me wrong, I don't mind a naughty word or even a few. Swearing at appropriate places can be unbelievably funny. But when you swear at an average speed of twice a minute or so, it stops being funny and becomes simply annoying. This has always bugged me in the series, but as the English and Swedish subtitles have been toned down, most of the viewers would neither know nor be bothered. Why would you want to see In the Pirkinning? To begin with, it may be (and probably is) the most expensive-looking film that has been made without professional funding. However, that's not the point. The film is also funny, well-paced for the most part and sometimes even witty. It also has good re-watching value. And did I tell you it's free? You can download it from the official Star Wreck web site. I strongly encourage you to see this film.",
         "Having seen all the earlier Star Wrecks, I was intrigued by what I saw in the trailers for the new one. Who wouldn't be? Normally visuals effects just don't do it for me, but in this case they seemed very interesting. Admittedly, this had a lot to with the fact that the movie is Finnish. Only one Finnish movie using visual effects before this one comes to mind (Rölli) and Star Wreck tops that easily. The visual effects are just another way of telling the story, as they should be. And what a story. I found it especially interesting that the protagonist is a megalomaniac out to conquer the universe. How often do we see that? Accompanied by an android and a more-or-less homicidal maniac, they actually manage to take over the world, but that is just the beginning. The acting is mostly horrible and at best campy, but I can live with that. The visuals are easily on par with the professional stuff done on Star Trek or other such TV-shows. Humor is often weak and the \"funny\" names just don't work. At times it's good, but there are not many moments which are laugh-out-loud funny. Gladly, the more low key humor works in parts very well. All in all, I liked the movie. I gave it a 9 (out of 10) because it's Finnish, in reality it's closer to a low 8 or high 7. I don't really know how well the jokes translate to other cultures, but hopefully the movie will get the attention it deserves. In Finland, the series has gained a sort of cult status and deservedly so.",
         "Damn, i loved the movie. I mean, I haven't had this much fun watching a movie in ages. I'v also seen the old starwrecks and i love them as well. Samuli has got some superb skills on rendering. :) The bonus material was nice. The sets you have been shooting the movie, hehe living rooms, nice. I'v seen the movie 4 times.. and i think i'll go see it again right now. Acting was good, as most of the actors were amateurs, except for one. GaryBrany, he was a pro, no doubt about it. All though this was a lil darker movie (in my mind at least), i could watch this thing over and over and over again, and not get bored. The concept is excellent. Startrek and Babylon 5, or should i say Starwreck and Babel. I bet the Babylon fans don't like the movie as much as Startrekkers. You should certainly check this movie out.",
         "I had some expectation's about the movie, but this was just amazing! I mean, it was action packet supreme cutting and every time you tough man this is just create! You where blown away by the next scene! CGI was just amazing and acting was just brilliant. Man i'm proud of guys who make such excellent movie with such low budget. I just bought Babylon 5 final series box \"Season 5\" And i must say, the CGI in this movie is much better than in original B5, well it is newer than B5 but as i understand the original CGI models of B5 where destroyed in fire. So these are build from scratch. Allso Star Trek models where equal comparison to the newest movies. 7 years in the making, it was worth every second."
