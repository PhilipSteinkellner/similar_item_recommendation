         "content": "Two mind systems operating from the same brain.\r\n\r\nBewitched is written and directed by Arch Oboler. It stars Phyllis Thaxter, Edmund Gwenn, Henry H. Daniels, Addison Richards, Horace McNally and Kathleen Lockhart. Music is by Bronislau Kaper and cinematography by Charles Salerno Jr.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting of splinters to come out of film noir was that which dealt with psychoanalysis. Be it mentally scarred war veterans, amnesia sufferers with locked in repression, or a victim being pushed to the mental abyss by an outside force, the state of mind factor was ripe for any sort of film noir sheen.\r\n\r\nWhat was under represented were films that dealt with mental illness' like schizophrenia or multiple (split) personalities. History tells us that Hollywood took a long time to get to grips with such topics, very much resorting to guesswork (and sometimes laughable) solutions to mental health issues just to close out the movies with a happy outcome.\r\n\r\nIt would take until 1957 and Three Faces of Eve (and to a lesser extent Hugo Haas' Lizzie released the same year) for the personality disorder issue to break out of Hollywood and into the public conscious. But even then with \"Eve\", if you take out Joanne Woodward's spell binding performance you are left with some mumbo-jumbo and a daft resolution to the curing of the patient.\r\n\r\nSo where does this leave Bewitched in 1945? Transferred from radio to the big screen by Oboler, from his own story titled Alter Ego, Bewitched suffers from the same simplified problems of so many like minded sub- genre movies, in that the resolution (\"cure\") is just so hard to get on board with. However...\r\n\r\nIf allowing the film some grace for the time it was made, then there's a very good picture here. Clocking in at just over an hour, it certainly feels and plays like one of those extended episodes of The Twilight Zone from Season 4, but the atmospherics and lead performances of cast members ensure this is fascinating and suspenseful entertainment.\r\n\r\nPlot essentially sees Thaxter as troubled Joan Alris Ellis, who after starting to hear a sinister voice in her head (voiced by noir darling Audrey Totter), flees to New York to start afresh, leaving behind family and her intended husband to be. After becoming involved in a warm relationship with Eric Russell (McNally), Joan finds that the voice, her alter ego, is not going to go away and urges Joan to commit murder.\r\n\r\nPic unfolds in a flashback structure, Joan is awaiting execution and we learn how she came to be in this situation. Oboler and Salerno film the piece through a film noir prism, ensuring that a disquiet mood is prevalent throughout. As the lens' mist up and shadows fall (99% of film is set in darkness or daylight as darkness), the visuals marry up nicely with poor Joan's befuddlement. \r\n\r\nOboler is guilty of letting the piece meander at times, as it often becomes over talky (the radio origins practically scream from the speakers!), but he has a very sharp eye for an evocative scene, and he's also capable of telling tech flourishes. Joan running down a street lit by bulbous lamps is straight out of noirville, distorted angles come and go, and clocks feature prominently, like Old Nick is right there counting down the seconds on every clock face.\r\n\r\nThen it's that resolution. Simplified for sure, but not without eeriness personified as Joan's femme fatale alter ego arrives on the scene in a clear case of angel and demon perched on either side of the hapless patient. With Thaxter excelling with her haunted portrayal, Gwenn exuding assurance unbound, and Kaper (Gaslight) drifting a creeping menace like musical score over the proceedings, the impact garnered belies the \"B\" budget afforded the play. 7.5/10",

      "reviews": [
         "This is a bold film for its time because it tackles mental illness head on - in this case multiple personality syndrome. Thaxter is quite good as the sweet young girl occasionally taken over by the evil Karin (voiced brilliantly by Audrey Totter). Unfortunately the director takes it all far too seriously, and his constant cut-aways to grim or shocked reaction shots becomes comical. You really feel for the actors. Thank God for the wonderful Edmund Gwenn, who is the only actor who makes the material almost believable. And what a great psychiatrist he is - he can cure multiple personality syndrome in a matter of seconds, just by talking sternly to the evil side! Some nice visual moments and the uniqueness of the material make this film worth a look.",
         "Wholesome gal Phyllis Thaxter lives with her upper-middle-class parents and plans to wed soon. But she's beginning to cause some concern; she's prone to odd fainting spells � blackouts, really � and to wandering the deserted streets of her midwestern city at night. Scant wonder, because living inside her, and clawing to get out, is Audrey Totter! Totter, in fact, gives perhaps the most chilling voice-of-the-demon performance until Mercedes McCambridge gave us Pazuzu in The Exorcist. Capitalizing on the heightened interest in abnormal psychology spurred by the return of shell-shocked veterans, Bewitched latches onto a tabloid-worthy subject � multiple personality disorder. It's noteworthy in doing so a dozen years before both Lizzie and The Three Faces of Eve, in which, respectively, Eleanor Parker and Joanne Woodward (who nabbed the Oscar) displayed similar symptoms. Footnotes in medical journals probably do not cite any of these movies, so facile is their treatment of a troubling and controversial syndrome. Thaxter tries a geographical cure, fleeing to New York where she falls in love with a lawyer (Stephen McNally). But when her old fiancé tracks her down, Totter, who apparently wasn't left behind, emerges to kill him with a pair of scissors. Then comes a stylized courtroom fantasy lifted all but intact from Boris Ingster's Stranger On The Third Floor, followed by a real murder trial. Wise old psychiatrist Edmund Gwynne explains everything to us, along with the Governor and his wife, and then proceeds to exorcize Totter (who, by the way, calls herself Karen). Apart from Thaxter's nocturnal excursion, there's little original or striking about the movie. That we see the good girl but only hear the bad one is a big part of the problem. The extra energy that might have come from seeing Karen in action � for that matter, from casting Totter on-screen � gets thrown away. They picked the wrong personality.",
         "No need to repeat the plot. The force behind the movie is Arch Oboler, an established radio heavyweight at the time. From his credits, it looks like he kept searching for a handle in Hollywood but never quite found it. Certainly, it wasn't from lack of imagination�his 1951 film \"Five\" dealt with nuclear post-apocalypse in a resourceful and compelling way at a time when no studio would touch the subject. That same bold imagination is evident in this movie as well. The professionals dismiss the film as \"heavy-handed\", which it is. However, there are compensations that are too easily overlooked. Aside from Thaxter's fine performance, the movie contains several profoundly imaginative touches. Catch that moody dollying shot down the deserted city street that finally fixes on a cringing Thaxter hiding behind an open doorway. Not only is it great atmosphere, but it also sort of sums up Thaxter's predicament. She's afraid to come out into the world for risk of immediate exposure, so she clings fearfully to a hidden world where only she exists. It's a well-conceived and artfully executed passage. Then there's that darn-near sublime set-up with Thaxter huddled in a concert hallway while we see a long-shot of a vocalist pinpointed by a thin beam of light. The woman intones a mournful version of My Old Kentucky Home, like the proverbial voice in the darkened wilderness. It may be the only glimpse we get of Thaxter's true inner self, summed up poetically. But the overly literal side does unfortunately predominate, and I wish someone had more confidence in audience imagination. For one thing, that would have eliminated the two hokey doppelgangers in the exorcism scene. Also, the conventional happy ending is much too pat for the problem being dealt with, but is indicative of the time. And if I'm not mistaken, there's a quick reference from Gwenn to Thaxter's problem as being genetic, as if a multiple personality trait can be passed along in the genes. I'm no clinical psychologist, but I doubt seriously this is the prevailing view. Anyway, it's too bad Oboler couldn't get a better handle on Hollywood. I think his credits showed genuine promise. This movie may be unfortunately flawed (perhaps because of studio dictates), but the very real compensations should not be overlooked.",
         "This '45 programmer--or \"B\" picture--is too simplistic to deal with a serious subject like multiple personality. Only Edmund Gwenn can make the diagnosis sound mildly plausible--as incredible as it must have seemed to audiences at the time--and the script never goes deep enough into the girl's background to give us a convincing case history. This is strictly a superficial, but earnest and interesting attempt to tell the story of a girl with multiple personality disorder who commits a crime when her evil side takes over. Performances are only competent. Little known actor Henry Daniell, Jr. is miscast as the unlucky boyfriend who is killed. (He was Judy Garland's handsome brother in 'Meet Me In St. Louis'). There is no chemistry between him and Miss Thaxter. Horace McNally (later Stephen), Minor Watson and Edmund Gwenn render good support. Miss Thaxter (a minor actress who appears to be styled after Laraine Day) has little chance to make her role credible. An early film noir from MGM that is unfortunately much less effective than it could have been with a more fully developed script. By today's standards, when so much more is known about this kind of personality disorder, the overall story has a very flat effect indeed. Some good camera tricks and crisp black and white photography give it some needed atmosphere. A nice try. Trivia note: If you listen carefully to the voice of the alter ego, that sounds like AUDREY TOTTER dubbing the evil voice.",
         "Bewitched is written and directed by Arch Oboler. It stars Phyllis Thaxter, Edmund Gwenn, Henry H. Daniels, Addison Richards, Horace McNally and Kathleen Lockhart. Music is by Bronislau Kaper and cinematography by Charles Salerno Jr. One of the most interesting of splinters to come out of film noir was that which dealt with psychoanalysis. Be it mentally scarred war veterans, amnesia sufferers with locked in repression, or a victim being pushed to the mental abyss by an outside force, the state of mind factor was ripe for any sort of film noir sheen. What was under represented were films that dealt with mental illness' like schizophrenia or multiple (split) personalities. History tells us that Hollywood took a long time to get to grips with such topics, very much resorting to guesswork (and sometimes laughable) solutions to mental health issues just to close out the movies with a happy outcome. It would take until 1957 and Three Faces of Eve (and to a lesser extent Hugo Haas' Lizzie released the same year) for the personality disorder issue to break out of Hollywood and into the public conscious. But even then with \"Eve\", if you take out Joanne Woodward's spell binding performance you are left with some mumbo-jumbo and a daft resolution to the curing of the patient. So where does this leave Bewitched in 1945? Transferred from radio to the big screen by Oboler, from his own story titled Alter Ego, Bewitched suffers from the same simplified problems of so many like minded sub- genre movies, in that the resolution (\"cure\") is just so hard to get on board with. However... If allowing the film some grace for the time it was made, then there's a very good picture here. Clocking in at just over an hour, it certainly feels and plays like one of those extended episodes of The Twilight Zone from Season 4, but the atmospherics and lead performances of cast members ensure this is fascinating and suspenseful entertainment. Plot essentially sees Thaxter as troubled Joan Alris Ellis, who after starting to hear a sinister voice in her head (voiced by noir darling Audrey Totter), flees to New York to start afresh, leaving behind family and her intended husband to be. After becoming involved in a warm relationship with Eric Russell (McNally), Joan finds that the voice, her alter ego, is not going to go away and urges Joan to commit murder. Pic unfolds in a flashback structure, Joan is awaiting execution and we learn how she came to be in this situation. Oboler and Salerno film the piece through a film noir prism, ensuring that a disquiet mood is prevalent throughout. As the lens' mist up and shadows fall (99% of film is set in darkness or daylight as darkness), the visuals marry up nicely with poor Joan's befuddlement. Oboler is guilty of letting the piece meander at times, as it often becomes over talky (the radio origins practically scream from the speakers!), but he has a very sharp eye for an evocative scene, and he's also capable of telling tech flourishes. Joan running down a street lit by bulbous lamps is straight out of noirville, distorted angles come and go, and clocks feature prominently, like Old Nick is right there counting down the seconds on every clock face. Then it's that resolution. Simplified for sure, but not without eeriness personified as Joan's femme fatale alter ego arrives on the scene in a clear case of angel and demon perched on either side of the hapless patient. With Thaxter excelling with her haunted portrayal, Gwenn exuding assurance unbound, and Kaper (Gaslight) drifting a creeping menace like musical score over the proceedings, the impact garnered belies the \"B\" budget afforded the play. 7.5/10",
         "Prototype Film-Noir from Stylist Arch Oboler Who Made His Name on the Radio with His Ultra-Popular \"Lights Out\" Program. Here He Adopts His Own Story \"Alter-Ego\" and Brings it to the Screen for MGM. This is One of the Few MGM Noirs of the First Wave. It Would Take Years Before the Haughty Studio Would Lend its Name Seriously to a Style So Dark. Phyllis Thaxter Gives a Good Performance in a Soul-Baring Role. Steve McNally is Miscast but Manages to Look Desperate and Edmund Gwenn as the Psychiatrist Trying to Exorcise Thaxter's Other Personality, the Evil One, is a Good Try. With its Roots in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the Only Reference Point at This Point for Multiple Personalities On Screen, Oboler Delivers and Ultra-Stylish Descent into Schizophrenia. The Film is Guilty of Way Too Much Verbiage, a Radio Drama Influence, but it Balances it with Film Flourishes that are Atmospheric and Stunning. The Movie Grips the Audience as it Tries to Explain and Expose Psychiatric Methods and Procedures. But the Truth is that Not Much Was Known at the Time and the Little that Was Known was Constantly Up for Debate in the Medical Community. So it was No Easy Task Transferring This to the Movies. For Years Hollywood Gave it Go with Extremely Inconsistent Results. It Was a Staple in Film-Noir and the Horror of Val Lewton but Main Stream and \"A\" Pictures were Reluctant to Take It On for Quite Some Time. Overall, This Was a Great Early Effort and a Striking Forerunner to Film-Noir and the Psychological Pictures that Started a Run After the War and Never Stopped, and Actually Becoming a Genre of its Own (The Psychological Thriller).",
         "Average yet enteraining story about a young girl being plagued with a voice inside telling her what to do. The girl breaks down and listens to the voice, moving across country leaving her family and fiancée behind to make a new start. The film then has a new man come into the girl's life when old wounds are re-opened and tragedy strikes. While nothing particularly inventive takes place, I rather liked the mood created throughout the film. The film opens with the female protagonist in jail for a crime she didn't yet did commit. Phyllis Thaxter as Joan, the troubled young lady with multiple personalities living inside her, gives a more than competent portrayal of this tortured woman, yet the film's story is rather weak and completely falls apart in the last third when some ridiculous scientific explanation is given for her aberrant behaviour. Edmund Gwenn plays a psychiatrist/family friend and gives the film a bit of credibility with his performance. The rest of the cast is adequate and the film is mildly entertaining. Hypnosis, the gas chamber, and playing with scissors are all explored.",
         "***SPOILERS**** Early Hollywood attempt to explain duel personalities, schizophrenia, in the usual feel good and Hollywood happy ending way. Joan Ellis, Phyllis Thaxter, has been having fainting spells and hearing voices and feels that she's going insane. Leaving her confused fiancée Bob Arnold, Henry H. Daniel Jr, practically at the altar Joan ends up in New York City as a cigarette and cigar girl in the lobby of the Stafford Hotel. Pretty and wholesome looking Joan quickly attracts young lawyer Eric Russell, Stephan McNally, who's so crazy about her that he seems to forget that he has a slew of clients to attend to and spends every minute trying to get Joan to go out with him on a date. Finally going out with Eric on a boat-ride around Manhattan Island Joan get's possessed by her evil alter-ego, Audrey Totter's voice, who turns the sweet and shy Joan into a mad dog killer. Finding her fiancée Bob at her hotel room, it's never explained how Bob found out where she was, Joan is taken over by her alter-ego who causes her to stab Bob in the back with a pair of scissors killing him. On trial for her life Joan being defended by Eric who uses an insanity defense, to get Joan off from being executed, to prove her innocence. When the verdict is about to be read by the jury foreman, not guilty, Joan who didn't say a word in her defense during the entire trial jumps up out of her chair admitting that she in fact killed Bob which nobody, not even her lawyer Eric, disputed. The sentence is quickly changed from innocent by reason of insanity to guilty of first degree murder. This action by the jury was so ridicules that you wondered if the jurors knew just what the trial was all about! Joan's killing Bob was never in doubt and her insane action at the end of her trial was just more evidence that she was, like the jury at the time determined, not in control of her mental faculties and more then justified their original verdict! We then have this long and boring explanation about split/personalities by Dr. Bergson, Edmund Gwenn, that leads him to finally convince the Governor Minor Watson to have Joan hypnotized to draw out her evil alter-ego and free her. This is all done to prove her murder of Bob wasn't her fault and keep Joan from going to the electric chair. Dr. Bergson putting Joan under hypnosis splits her in two as the bad Joan is slowly overcome by the good Joan and in the end, the bad Joan, is forever gone out of her mind and memory. The hypnosis session by Dr. Bergson is so laborious and stultifying that it almost puts you, as it did Joan, to sleep. The movie \"Bewitched\" is just both too hard to follow and too simplistic in it's conclusions, on mental illness, since it tries to explain a very complex and difficult subject in very simple terms. An illness so complicated and mysterious, even now in 2006 much less in 1945, as schizophrenia is nowhere as easy to understand and cure as if it were just a bad toothache! Which is what Dr Bergson tries to make mental illness look like.",
         "Bewitched (1945) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Joan Alris Ellis (Phyllis Thaxter) is your typical young woman. She's happy, healthy and looking forward to her upcoming marriage but then she begins to hear voices. Soon these voices are taking over her life so she runs away from her fiancé and family hoping to find some peace but soon she murders a man. Was it her or the voices? BEWITCHED is a pretty interesting film that has a lot of creative moments and it's certainly a film that's ahead of its time. It certainly fits in quite well with the film noir from this era but there are plenty of horror elements and you could really argue that it touched on some similar subjects that Alfred Hitchcock would do fifteen years later in PSYCHO. Sadly, not all of the elements come together as well as they should but there's no question that the film is worth watching. The best thing working for the film is Arch Oboler's direction because he keeps the film moving at a rather nice pace and he also handles the various elements quite nicely. I thought the psychological aspect of the film was the highlight because there are several scenes where the lead character battles with herself and these are extremely effective. I also thought the noir aspect with the cinematography was good. I think the film loses some of its power during the finale, which I won't spoil but it was a tad bit too sappy for me. Thaxter is good in the lead and performs both characters very well. Edmund Gwenn, Henry H. Daniels, Jr. and Addison Richards are also good in their parts. BEWITCHED was certainly ahead of its time and deserves a lot of credit for the subject matter.",
         "A woman on death row is discovered to have a split personality in \"Bewitched,\" a 1945 film starring Phyllis Thaxter, Edmund Gwenn, and Stephen McNally. Thaxter is a young, soon to be wed woman who has blackouts, walks around at night, and hears voices. She runs away from her parents' home and her husband to be and goes to New York, gets a job, and meets an attorney (McNally) who falls for her. Her fiancé finds her, and, under orders from her other personality (voiced by Audrey Totter), she kills him. Now we're brought back to death row where Edmund Gwenn suspects her problem and wants to hypnotize her. Boring film with a good cast nonetheless, psychiatric disorders being a fashionable subject during and after World War II. What made Three Faces of Eve interesting was that the main character was a woman with a dull affect, but her personalities had lots of spark. Just hearing the voice of Totter here isn't enough. If Thaxter had actually been taken over by her alternate personality and, say, lived as her in New York, the film would have been a lot more interesting. Not very good."
