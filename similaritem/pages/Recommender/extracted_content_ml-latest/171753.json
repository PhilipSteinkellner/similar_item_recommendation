         "Jason Trost never fails to deliver on tongue-in-cheek satires. Wet and Reckless has an absurdity level on par with The FP, spoofing reality television with a no-holds-barred attitude. Also much like The FP, the comedy is deadpan, raucous, coarse, graphic, and shocking (these are all compliments, mind you). However, the real difference between Trost's breakthrough film and Wet and Reckless is that there are a few true moments of vulnerability displayed by the characters; moments where the comedy almost fades away and you see some legitimate emotion from the actors that explain really why each character is such a mess. These moments are brief, but help to put this movie in a very exceptional category where the over-the-top concept almost seems like it could be plausible. Do not be fooled by these remarks though, because this movie is anything but serious. Trost and his crew waged unconventional film warfare from start to finish with a minimal set, an even smaller workforce, and by going as far as utilizing real and unsuspecting tourists in Thailand to execute some of the funnier moments in the movie. With a bigger budget, Trost could have easily landed this film in theaters nationwide with significant success. If you're a fan of his previous films, or if you just love movies that display crass social commentary, then this movie comes with the highest of recommendations.",
         "OK, let me say that Jason Trost's first movie The FP became one of my favorite movies ever the instant I saw it. Everything about it, from the silly Dance Dance Revolution concept taken to a ridiculous extreme, to the scene stealing extras, to the ducks, it is literally the best thing ever. Wet and Reckless is not. This \"movie\" is what happens when a group of friends take a trip to Thailand and decide to shoot a film while on vacation. Unfortunately nothing works. The concept is less than half realized, continuity errors abound, the sound (taken from always visible lavalier mics) and editing is sloppy and terrible (there is no pacing, and second-hand dub-step is always running on loop in the background). Worst of all the entire film is cheap, looks unfinished, and aside from a few punchlines that land - unfunny. It's barely more than a home movie, is completely un-cinematic, and features the most horrible use \"PowerPoint\" I've ever seen in a film...wait I don't think I've ever seen PowerPoint used in a film. Throughout the second act, it is unclear whether the \"cast\" is still being followed by a camera crew or have indeed been abandoned by their reality show producers. I can't really recall the ending because I pretty much dozed off. There certainly weren't any ducks! In The FP, though you could occasionally see the seams of its low budget origin, the film never forgot to be funny nor to stray from it's over the top ridiculousness. All Superheroes Must Die, though ultimately unsatisfying and with terrible costume design, at least had a clever premise and the conviction of it's cast. Wet and Reckless is at most a 15 minute Youtube short bloated out to a 90 minute run time, and it is not anywhere near as entertaining as the reality shows it attempts to satirize. Sorry Jtro, but you gotta try harder."
