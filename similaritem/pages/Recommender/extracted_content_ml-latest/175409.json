The summer of his 14th birthday, his encounter with Nicostratos, a pelican and Angeliki, a 15 year old city-girl, changes his life. Once you've overcome the fact that everybody on this Greek island speaks french, this is a rather quaint conventional coming of age and boy/bird/girl friendship movie with nice settings and photography, and good actors, including renowned film director Emir Kusturica (Black Cat White Cat, Underground, Arizona Dream, When Father Was Away on Business), without forgetting the great animal coaching of the pelicans. A good film to watch with kids."],

His friendship with the pelican, and meeting with the impulsive 15 year old girl, will mark a change in his life, that will eventually lead to reconciliation with his father."],
