Still I watched this, largely due to the involvement of several favorite actors and the script having been written by the Duplass brothers.\r\n\r\nI found it almost instantly both funny and moving, and the longer I watched, the more confused I became as to why most critics had been lukewarm or downright dismissive of it. I figured it had to be mostly due to the genre blend of comedy and more dramatic issues, and that probably most of the criticism had been along the usual lines of \"can't make up it's mind', etc. But even so, that didn't add up to a meager 40% rating, with such a clever script and great acting.\r\n\r\nWhen the credits rolled, I knew instantly why: A happy ending...\r\n\r\nIt all mostly works out in the end for the oddball protagonists. Critics in general can't stand it. If a movie has had a degree of realism and/or several dark or borderline dark-ish issues brought up along the way, critics tend to go ******* unless it all ends in misery, or largely unresolved, or at the very least in ambiguity. God forbid you walk away from such a movie actually feeling good; that equals 'cheesy' in most reviewers book. Was it realistic that most of the people involved got a happy, somewhat romantic ending? Of course not, but though the movie tackles several 'real' issues within the comedy, I found the ending perfectly fitting with the tone of it. Critics often use the word 'predictable' about anything that has a hint of romantic comedy in it, but I'd say, there are few things as predictable as movie critics in general.\r\n\r\nIf you want to read what I consider a spot on review for this, check out Empire Magazine, who went against the stream and gave it 4 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "**It was not a table of honour!**\r\n\r\nI thought it was some B movie. Expecting anything from it is like a total waste. But that was not the case. I was surprised how simple it was, yet very entertaining. Not all the small films like this would do the same magic. Everything in the was like I already seen in other films, even though I enjoyed it thoroughly.\r\n\r\nIt was a one-day event tale and in the backdrop of a wedding. In that, the film focused on one particular table, the table number 19 on the outskirt the dining hall. They all came from different background and never met before. They learn about each other, and their personal issues open up during the cerebration. Apart from that, they mess up a few things and later try to fix it, that all comes into play before it reaches the end.\r\n\r\nFrom the director of 'Rocket Science', which came a decade ago, also starred by Anna Kendrick. I think he is a fine director, at least in small comedies with the good quality screenplay. So he should be doing more feature films than the television series. I was impressed by Kendrick. Her choices of films might not be the greatest, but she's almost there and very soon going to give a career best for sure. The remaining cast was funnily good.\r\n\r\nI think this film deserves a sequel. Because the film characters are very distinctive and has left behind a lot about them which need to be revealed. Sequel or prequel, it does not matter, but I'll be surely looking for one. Look at its cost, just $5 million. Big production houses can give away such tiny amount without expecting any returns.\r\n\r\nYou might see it rated low everywhere, but for me, it is a good comedy. One of the best small budget films. Yeah, the end was very clich√©d, but acceptable for such film. I would definitely suggest it for those who won't anticipate in films they watch. Particularly if you prefer simple storyline and a few laughs, it is the one.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",

         "At first I wasn't looking forward to watch Table 19.I assume that you already know the plot if you are reading user's reviews but you are not sure if you should watch the movie or not so , I am just going to tell you not be afraid of the poor rating and just watch the movie.Full of funny and dramatic moments and unexpected twists that reveal slowly the character's background I believe that Table 19 is a great movie for both drama and comedy lovers. All the actors give excellent performances and make you feel closer and more attached to the characters. It was just a great film and I really hope that it gets the reputation that it deserves.",
         "Trailers are notorious in over-promising for movies that under-deliver. But every now and then, one pops up that does the opposite. The trailer for Table 19 (2017) gives the impression of a lightweight romantic comedy with a touch of slapstick, all framed around a wedding. Despite being critically panned by many, there is more to this unexpectedly entertaining low-profile film than meets the eye. The heroine is Eloise (Anna Kendrick) who, against her better judgement, accepts a wedding invitation knowing she is persona non-grata with the bridal party. She was recently dumped by the bride's brother, who is now the best man, and she is suddenly no longer the bride's best friend. She was the chief helper with the reception planning and knows who is at every table and why they are here. Her companions on Table 19 comprise a lovable granny-type, two oddballs, and a quarrelling married couple. They were all expected to decline their invitation but still send a gift, and that alone is a recipe for humour and satire. Their distance from the bridal table and proximity to the toilets quickly establishes their lowly social status and the comic sketches play on social awkwardness. The thread of continuity is through Eloise and her manhunts. The standard sit-com one-liners and the obligatory near-catastrophe with a wedding cake are neither original nor particularly funny, but the situation develops a warm emotional undercurrent that is unexpectedly touching. One of the interesting things about this film is the difference between its plot and story. The plot is standard wedding reception comedy which laughs at the marginalisation of unwanted guests. On the other hand, the story explores why the Table 19'ers are together. It offers insight into their lives, their personalities, and the emotional hurt caused by being placed on the social fringe. The best part of the film is when the offended \"randoms\" leave the reception for a while to console each other. Through flashbacks we get the back-story to their invitations which range from pathetic to comic. For example, the granny-type really believed she was invited because the bride fondly remembered her first baby-sitter, but the bride barely knows who she is. There is also a wannabe trying to lose his virginity, a weird guy straight out of prison, and a couple who are far from an inspiring example of a loving marriage. Anna Kendrick plays the perfect balance between awkward, aggrieved, and aggressive, and the randoms are standard comic stereotypes. But while our eyes are on Elosie, the warmth of the story come from her table companions. The gags are at snicker level rather than belly laughs and the cinematography is colourful and cluttered as wedding receptions often are. There is no shortage of embarrassing moments as Eloise stalks her men, both old and new, and the final scenes rise through melodrama to operatic farce. But this film offers a fresh take on standard rom-com themes in amusing and entertaining ways\u0085. and it might make you think twice if you need to create a seating plan.",
         "I've been reviewing films off and on for about five years. And if there is one thing I've learned about criticism is that the vast, unchallenged mean between absolutely great movies and downright terrible ones hides a lot of non-committal fence sitting. I'm guilty of it myself; in today's age of instant self-gratification, it's easy to cobble together a knee-jerk opinion based on someone else's ideas. Problem is those ideas, whether valid or not, sometimes creates a subterfuge of undeserved hype or undeserved vitriol depending on the circumstance. They feed a cycle of wafer-thin subjectivity masquerading as authoritative proof of something's worth. This is why, for example a movie like Equilibrium (2002) can be seen as something more than a splashy Matrix (1999) rip-off while movies like Mystery Team (2009) are swept under the rug. So it is with Table 19, a movie no one will likely see because the critical consensus is so bad that it's created its own negative feedback loop. Table 19 takes place over the course of several hours of a wedding reception at a rustic hotel lodge. As the happy couple celebrates their new marriage amid friends and family, a small group of strangers sit at the back table, forcing uncomfortable banter and gracelessly ignoring the reason for their position in the back. Among them are the argumentative Kepps (Kudlow and Robinson), the dotty Ms. Jo (Squibb), gawky teen Renzo (Revolori), distant cousin Walter (Merchant) and Eloise (Kendrick) the disgraced ex-Maid of Honor who was dumped by the Best Man (Russell). To say Table 19 is \"ridiculous and a mess,\" is a bit of an understatement. As critics rightly point out, the pacing is stop and go, the editing is slapdash and the high-concept simply doesn't have the wherewithal to make it through a feature-length movie. Once the initial awkward niceties are flushed under the force of the first big narrative reveal, the film descends into a checklist of soapy plot-points and lazy character short hands. Much like 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag (a similarly imperfect ensemble farce), Table 19 klutzily mixes its farcical elements with broad, sweeping story setups and has them slosh about until the runtime wears out. On top of it all, the tone shifts wildly depending on who you're following at the time. Thing is, I actually liked 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag, and I liked Table 19 too for much the same reason. The characters, as broad as they may be at times never ceased to entertain; Stephen Merchant's portrayal as a familial pariah Franken-walking through the banquet hall is worth the admission price alone. As are Renzo's far too honest conversations with his mother (Martindale in a superb unseen role) which mostly consist of him rolling his eyes while she pushes him to \"get laid already.\" Behind the Kepps' increasingly hostile quibbling and Grandma Jo's insistence that she'll be remembered (just you wait), lays a unified feeling of melancholy. That feeling of melancholy along with some solid comedic setups and payoffs permeate through the film's cosmetic faults. Every time you're distracted by an awkward cut or taken aback by some of the more hammy moments, the film quickly lulls you back with its quixotic charm. Helping to dry up this mess and put it back into a nice looking bucket is the relentless Anna Kendrick who by now has turned the neurotic jilted girl archetype into a symbol of quasi-empowerment. While she wins no brownie points for that here, there's something near noble about the way she throws herself into the fray. She easily elevates an already stellar cast and sells the hell out of the movies main conceit. Much like the twangy banjo version of Pachabel's Canon in D that plays over the film's title sequence, Table 19 is a unique version of a very old cultural tradition. It's certainly not the best version of what it could be but with more than a handful of charming performances, this delightful little farce deserves a little better than the wedding inspired japes it's been getting from critics. Perhaps it's a case of ugly duckling syndrome on my part, but I'm going to go ahead and say \"I Do\" to this one.",
         "I confess I find weddings tedious at the best of times but we always go with a sense of optimism. Anna Kendrick's character was clearly on the fence about attending but decided to be brave and attend. She is seated at the table of people who were surprised to get an invitation and we learn that she is the best man's ex-girlfriend and former Maid of Honour for this event. Nobody beautiful, rich or influential is at table 19. It turns out they are all at a turning point in their lives and the story evolves about their various crisis. These people are all amazing in their on right and their stories are interesting (far more interesting than any the beautiful people have).# The soundtrack is well chosen and the spark of sensuality provided when Huck and Eloise dance is well done. The wedding isn't dressed up as a great event - its an ordinary American wedding and thankfully, there is a limited amount of it. I can't recommend it highly enough, in a time when films have no script at all",
         "So I loved this movie! It's a brilliant single setting-ish script about various \"reject\" guests at a wedding table with Anna Kendrick in the lead. It's like \"The Breakfast Club\" of wedding movies. The script is witty, intelligent and the attention to detail for the set, specifically with the wedding band and their selection of songs, was sublime. Bravo to the Duplass brothers on pulling together a very well-made and well-thought out film. Lisa Kudrow shows she still has great talent and her deadpan comedy is still funny. And the pairing of Kudrow with Craig Robinson as her husband was genius, they actually pair off of each other really great. Anna Kendrick's character Elsie dreads going to her former best friend/former boyfriend's sister's wedding. She meets the other rejects at the table and explains the pecking order of the wedding tables. Elsie meets a dashing stranger Huck, confronts the former boyfriend/bride's brother, and the Table 19 guests have quite the day with unexpected twists. Highly recommend.",
         "Sure the plot and script might have been a tad predictable, but, it was an unexpected charmer. A wonderful cast and fun script with many chuckles. It is NOT Separate Tables but it certainly was worthwhile viewing a nice little light comedy that is perfect on a summers night. Table 19 contained the misfits of a wedding but eventually had the most fun and impact on their wedding they were the last to be invited at.",
         "and somewhat intelligent romcon. I don't know why it didn't get any love from critics, especially with the young and veteran talents of Anna Kendrick and Lisa Kudrow . Solid seven. . . .For peeps who want a dramedy as opposed to a laugh riot. \"Wedding Crashers,\" it ain't. Word of caution: It's a little rocky through the first twenty minutes, but the last three quarters of the film make that set up well worthwhile. Since it's an ensemble piece, there's some scenes well spent sketching all the characters seated in the no-man's land of table 19. But this investment will pay off sweetly in the end.",
         "the film with that cast - Anna Kendrick, Lisa Kudrow, Craig Robinson, Toni Revolori being some of my favorites - could really have been fun and truly enjoyable. But a good cast doesn't make a good script. I wonder how tailored each role is for the cast, I'm guessing apart from Anna's role not so much? Not sold on the bulk of the film / the main pairing much so that was particularly not enjoyable for me. However, June Squibb was lovely and Stephen Merchant was a welcome oddball (though the humor overall of the film doesn't really land). Conclusions for other story lines were not really satisfying and there was cheesiness all through out.",
         "It is not a masterpiece, but a sweet one. I would watch it as a sitcom too, it has a good potential to it. Especially for those who do not expect a movie to save their lives, reveal the meaning of life or thrill them. I liked the more realistic turn it took and the reminder to never trust your judgements completely. Table 19 turned to be to worse or better than any other tables in the room.",
         "Solid performance from the cast, unexpected twist and unpredicted ending make this movie quite enjoyable. It's no Oscar nominee, but definitely better than the rating it got now.",
         "Very few laughs. If you're looking for a dumb party/ceremony comedy like \"Office Christmas Party\" or \"Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates\" (both of which were mediocre but had funny moments) you're out of luck. In fact, about half way through... SPOILERS!!... it turns into the super-serious part of \"The Breakfast Club,\" and starts dealing with issues such as pregnancy, infidelity, crime, cancer/death etc. The problem is, whereas we cared about the characters in \"The Breakfast Club,\" these characters are not really likable or interesting. There's even a pot-smoking scene where we're supposed to bond with and empathise with the characters, but... it just doesn't work. There's even a scene where the characters run together down hallways. Unfortunately, the dope is no longer in Johnson's underwear. Give this one a miss.",
         "The awkwardness moment of going to a wedding and sitting in a table with other people that may or may not be close to the groom/bride and they chat about how they know them and if they are even being recognized or forgettable type of guests. Table 19 is terrible, it is unfunny, tries to be awkward and shine with the characters but fails to even capture the attention. The film opens with Eloise (Anna Kendrick) hesitating about accepting the invitation to her oldest friend Francine's wedding who her brother Teddy (Wyatt Russell) is now her ex. He dumps her because she always belittled his intelligence. She goes back and forth with the invitation by saying no than yes, even almost setting the card on fire. But she ends up going to the wedding, even after she had helped planned the event and set up seating arrangements. She ends up sitting on table 19 with a bunch of other people she does not know. At the table, there is Jerry (Craig Robinson) and Bina (Lisa Kudrow) who barely knows the groom and bride but are in a struggling marriage. Then, there is Jo (June Squibb), who was the first nanny to the bride but her entire family forgot about who she was. Then, Walter (Stephen Merchant) who seems out of place and awkward with every conversation about himself not adding up. And Renzo (Tony Revolori) was invited to go cause his mother told him he needs to find a girlfriend or get laid to become a man. Eloise is dwelling on her last break up until she meets a wedding crasher Huck (Thomas Cocquerel) who flirts and dances with her but bails out of the wedding before he gets caught. Teddy keeps reminding Eloise that she should go home and not cause a scene. The film could have worked with its humor and the different awkward characters they introduced. However, none of the humor in the film was funny. It was stupid, it was awkward, and unfunny. The editing with each scene feels like a mash up with its dull humor. Every character had their own conflict and sharing the same table in a wedding that no one seems interested in being there. When every thing tries to resolve itself in the end, it seems forced when characters forget about what their problem really was. I liked the cast ensemble. Except every ones performance was forgettable from a lackluster script that failed to even develop any of these characters. The plot was pointless, well if you would even count it as a plot which it had none. The direction was dull, terribly edited together in order to try to get laughs. There is nothing positive or funny about this poorly executed comedy movie. Overall, Table 19 is horrible. From its terrible editing of lots awkward moments, unfunny humor, poor characters development, boring script and direction. I would not recommend the film at all unless its on cable TV.",
         "Duplass Brother highbrow writing is usually worth a watch. I was happy with the result not the wedding comedy I had expected, but a nice slice of life film. Quite a few recognizable actors seemed to pull off the roles in style. The film seemed a little rushed and mysterious at the beginning and the questions were answered by the end of the film, in a non-standard method. With a big budget the romp scenes could've been bigger and funnier, but this was original.",
         "\"Table 19\" brings the (mis)adventures of Eloise. As the movie opens, Eloise is hesitating whether to \"accept with pleasure\" or to \"decline with regret\" a wedding invitation she just received. In the end she decides to go. She hesitated because she was just dumped, via text no less we later learn, by her boyfriend Teddy, whose sister is getting hitched. Along the way, Eloise is also relegated from sitting at Table 1 (with the bride and groom) to Table 19, a table in the back corner. At Table 19, there are 5 other people, including the bride's nanny, a bickering wedded couple, and a guy who is in a halfway house for stealing. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out. Couple of comments: this movie was originally scheduled to be directed by Mark and Jay Duplass, who co-wrote the script. It ended up being directed by Jeffrey Blitz (best known for directing \"The Office\" TV series. The Duplass involvement gave me confidence to hope that this would be a worthwhile, if not quite straight up (that's how the Duplass brothers operate), comedy with a romantic undertone. Boy, was I wrong. The movie centers on the ensemble cast that make up Table 19, but unfortunately, at no point did I felt emotionally connected or invested in these characters. Worse yet, the movie is simply not funny. I didn't laugh a single time the entire movie, so for a movie that is billed as a comedy, that is a problem. In fact, about half-way through the movie, when the action finally steers away from the wedding dinner/reception, we get to understand some of the background of the ensemble cast, and the movie takes a turn toward sadness. Check out the bickering wedded couple, played by Lisa Kudrow and Craig Robinson: you just feel sorry for them. Anna Kendrick, who plays Eloise, can do no wrong in my book, but even she cannot save the movie, After yet another mishap, she retreats to the bathroom to freshen up, and as she looks at herself in the mirror, she tries to pep herself up and says \"this day will not suck!\", but you know that it will... Same thing at that point as far as the movie goes, as you want to yell at the screen \"this movie will not suck!\", but by then you deep down already know this is a lost cause. Thankfully the movie clears away some of the sad undercurrents, so that in the end we end up with something that is bittersweet, but I'll leave it to you to decide whether it's more bitter or more sweet. In the end, I felt hugely disappointed with this film, considering the involvement of the Duplass brothers and Anna Kendrick. \"Table 19\" opened this weekend on a handful of screens for all of Greater Cincinnati. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly. Six people in the theater, including myself. Given the dismal reviews this movie is getting, I can't see this playing very long in the theaters. If you are a fan of Anna Kendrick or even Lisa Kudrow, you want want to check this out on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, but keep your expectations low...",
         "Greetings again from the darkness. Writer/director Jeffrey Blitz (Spellbound) takes the approach that many wedding guests would prefer \u2013 he skips the wedding and heads straight to the reception. Another wise move by the filmmaker is assembling a very talented ensemble of funny folks. This cast proves they can wring a laugh from dialogue and moments that would probably otherwise not elicit much of an audience reaction. Instead, the full house on this evening had quite boisterous responses on numerous occasions. The initial set-up drags a bit as we are introduced to the characters that will soon enough populate Table 19 at the reception. Tony Revolori (The Grand Budapest Hotel bellhop) is Renzo, the longing for love (or anything similar) high schooler who might be a bit too close to his mother (voiced by the great Margo Martindale). Lisa Kudrow and Craig Robinson are the Kepp's, a mostly unhappily married couple who own and run a diner together. June Squibb is Jo, the bride's long-forgotten nanny who sees and knows more than most. Stephen Merchant plays the outcast nephew/cousin who has been recently released from his prison sentence for white collar crime. Lastly we have Anna Kendrick as Eloise, the fired maid of honor and former girlfriend of the bride's brother (Wyatt Russell), who also happens to be the best man and now dating the new maid of honor. This is the island of misfit wedding guests known as Table 19, and purposefully placed in the back corner as far as possible from the family and favored guests. Of course we know immediately that this Team Reject will unite for some uplifting purpose at some point, and the movie improves immediately once that goal has been revealed. Comedic timing in a group setting can often come across on screen as forced, and it's a tribute to the cast that these characters come across as human and real. Make no mistake though, this is Anna Kendrick's movie. She plays Eloise as we would imagine Anna Kendrick in this real life situation. Sure, a wedding reception is low-hanging fruit for comedy, but it's the third act where Ms. Kendrick's talent really shines. Comedy drawn from emotional pain is the most fulfilling because we've all been there. The melodrama that creeps in is pretty predictable, but that doesn't mean it's not a good time. The scenes with Ms. Kendrick and Wyatt Russell (Everybody Wants Some!, and Kurt and Goldie's son) are the best, and it leaves us wishing for more attention to both. Don't worry, the film features the required wedding cake mishap, a flirtatious wedding crasher (Thomas Cocquerel) and a drunken mother of the bride singing karaoke to Etta James' \"At Last\". It's designed to be a crowd-pleaser, and mostly succeeds with a nice blend of silly, cute, and emotional tugs.",
         "The movie's poster showed a decent cast... so I thought it was going to be some kind of slapstick Ben Stiller like movie, unfortunately it turned out instead to be a horrible attempt at recreating the breakfast club, and other 80s movies where a bunch of rejects end up finding happiness or something... The thing is 45 minutes into this movie and I still didn't care about the people sitting at table 19. And even though I didn't care what happened to these obnoxious people, the movie still carried on like the viewers will give a damn about this bunch of unlikable, unlikely people... This is just one big nothing of a movie... if the main characters have zero charm or charisma, how does the director expect people to care about the stories they have to tell? So anyway, if you are looking for a coming of age movie, try the breakfast club, but do yourself a favor and give this movie a wide berth...",
         "Why movies like these get funded and made is beyond me. Beyond Stephen Merchant's zingers and his really funny delivery, this movie did not deliver what could have been a super premise for psychological and sociological exploration. Instead we have a sappy love story, awkward dynamics between actors, lines that do not suit a character, and rather juvenile humour. Eek!",
         "No wedding is complete without a little drama, and this wedding is no exception. There's always that one table at a wedding that is crammed full of weirdos who have been invited out pity, and that is the very subject of this film. Table 19, as you may have guessed by now, is that such table. From a married couple in turmoil to a teenage boy who's trying to bag himself a girlfriend, this table has it all. Though the plot has a great concept behind it, it never seems to reach its full potential, which is no more helped by the often sloppy acting, which is only marginally saved by Anna Kendrick taking centre stage. A film that's entire focus is narrowed to a single table within the wider environment of a wedding is a difficult task and, unfortunately, one that I cannot say was successfully achieved within this attempt, which at most could be described as an experimental defeat.",
         "So I'm not an Anna Kendrick fan, but this film was well done. Her brand of placid acting is finally well placed in this film. The plot twists are much more interesting than I would have expected. The awkwardness of being at that \"last table\" (AKA No-Man's Land) at a wedding reception is humorously emphasized, with the intrigue of why the bride's best and oldest friend is there. I must end here. Go watch it. Not a blockbuster hit, but enough to make you smile and remember that not everything is as it seems and sometimes the \"ridiculous\" is perfect.",
         "The Duplass brothers, writers of the comedy Table 19, have always had a dry sense of humor (Cyrus, Jeff Who Lives at Home); here they make you parched with slow dialogue from lack of wit. Yet along the way their story is laced with heart no more evident than the warm misfits placed at the wedding's most dismissible table. Heading the notoriously neglected is Eloise (Anna Kendrick), the former bridesmaid jettisoned by the bride's brother before the ceremony. However, plucky El goes to the reception to confront her ex, support her oldest friend, and eventually meet charming table mates who spend some time upstairs smoking weed. The heart manifests itself in gentle Walter (Stephan Merchant), who is on release from prison; diminutive romantic Renzo (Tony Revolori), who just wants to \"get laid\"; Jerry (Craig Robinson) and Bina Kepp (Lisa Kudrow), who need marriage counseling and a better reason for their roles being in a comedy; and Jo (June Squibb), whose pot they are using and whose post as a former nanny gives her license to drag out the usual old-person's philosophy. Because these stereotypical outsiders are so lovable, the audience, who clapped at the end, seemed to forgive them for the flat dialogue and laughed mostly at their gratuitous pratfalls. In the end, nothing was worthy of the belly laughs found in Wedding Crashers or Bridesmaids. It's the dumping ground time of year for movies, and Table 19 fits the profile of a mediocre film thrown out at the beginning of the year because the suits don't want to chew up valuable space as the year progresses Yet, that heart\u2014you do feel affection for the eccentric characters and pity they have so little to say. Come to think of it, they are the victims of banal writing and as characters deserve to be at the infamous holding pen for undesirables, a bit like immigrants caught in political maneuvering. Table 19 is not the worst comedy to be released at this time of year.",
         "Pretty good movie, up until the final 15 minutes! The ending completely ruined the rest of the movie, and I felt that the people had got sick of the story line and tried to finish it off as quickly as possible. Nobody wants the girl to end up with the loser who dumped her! Sure if there is nothing else on and you can stop the movie 15 mins from the end, watch it, you might like it... I wouldn't suggest watching the whole thing tho!",
         "I had high hopes for this movie after watching it's brilliant trailer, So many brilliant actors and actresses featured in this film, Anna,one of favorite actresses since her role in Pitch Perfect. The screenshots were great and Acting was brilliant, Unfortunately the very slow moving pace of the film brought more depressing scenes rather than the comedy it was made out to be.",
         "Eloise (Anna Kendrick) has been jilted by her boyfriend, Teddy (Wyatt Russell). Unfortunately, Ted's sister is getting married soon and the bride is Eloise's good friend.. So, although it hurts like Hades, El decides to attend the event solo. When the reception begins, Eloise finds she has been stuck at Table 19, the one farthest away from the married couple, filled with misfits. There's the Kepps (Lisa Kudrow and Craig Robinson), who run a diner and don't really know why they were invited. Also, there's Renzo (Tony Revolori) who, as an almost-an-adult teen has hormones raging and aspires to meet a girl with the same. The rest of the table is a tall, tall cousin (Stephen Merchant) and the former nanny of the bride. As can be expected, Teddy is upset that Eloise is there and says so. But, wait, a handsome man seems to appear out of nowhere, and asks Eloise to dance. Also, the rest of Table 19 start to bond over their \"reject\" status. Will Eloise find a new love interest or is she still hung up on Teddy? The very mediocre film has a great cast. Kendrick, Kudrow, Robinson, Merchant, Russell, Revolori and all the others try as hard as they can to bring the story to life. Ultimately, the result is one flat movie with occasional laughs. The setting on an island in the Northwest is nice and costumes are fine but the direction is very tepid. Also, while Russell is a cutie, his scruffy appearance is a turn off to some admirers. My only reason for buying a ticket is that, as a romcom fan, I AM STARVED FOR SOMETHING NEW FROM Hollywood. So, if that's you as well, you might want to give it a whirl. Otherwise, book a showing of some far better film from your own television table.",
         "I watched this film on an airplane, so at least I didn't feel like I had wasted an hour and a half of my life. It was poorly written with very few redeeming qualities. While it might not have been the single worst film I have ever seen, the single worst film I have ever seen had more of a plot than Table 19. Halfway through I started wondering when any of the main characters would demonstrate a single redeeming quality. Entirely, it was a stupid film and a waste of time. Don't bother.",
         "Anna Kendrick attends a wedding and is assigned to Table 19 where we meet a host of interesting characters. This movie does a nice job of pairing Romantic Comedy with the lesson, life is messy. I thought it was beautiful. disclaimer: I'm a pretty big Anna Kendrick fan."

         "Ex-maid of honor Eloise (Anna Kendrick) - having been relieved of her duties after being unceremoniously dumped by the best man via text - decides to hold her head up high and attend her oldest friend's wedding anyway. She finds herself seated at the 'random' table in the back of the ballroom with a disparate group of strangers, most of whom should have known to just send regrets (but not before sending something nice off the registry). As everyone's secrets are revealed, Eloise learns a thing or two from the denizens of Table 19. Friendships - and even a little romance - can happen under the most unlikely circumstances.",
         "It is with mixed emotions that Eloise McGarry accepts the invitation to attend the wedding of Francie Millner and Douglas Grotsky, the festivities to take place at an upscale resort on an island on a lake, the island accessible only by ferry. The issue is that Francie is her oldest friend and she was to be Francie's maid of honor up until two months ago when Francie's brother, Teddy Millner, her boyfriend at the time and Doug's best man, unceremoniously dumped her via text message after dating for two years. Teddy's current girlfriend, Nikki, who he dated before Eloise, also replaced Eloise as maid of honor after Eloise already organized most of the wedding. Eloise doesn't want her and Teddy's issues to overshadow Francie and Doug's big day, they, who indirectly through Nikki, don't want her to either in moving her to Table 19 of nineteen at the reception, which Eloise knows is the table not only of the misfits, but those who were not smart enough to realize they really weren't wanted to attend the wedding. The others at Table 19 are: Jo Flanagan, Francie and Teddy's first nanny when they were kids; always bickering married couple Bina and Jerry Kepp, diner owners, acquaintances of Doug's father who owns a chain of diners, the Kepps who weren't even seated with other such acquaintances; high schooler Renzo Eckberg, whose mother encouraged him to attend instead of going to his high school prom as a better prospect to lose his virginity as no one at the reception knows him; and Mr. Millner's socially awkward nephew Walter Thimble, his uncle who never expected him to show up \"under the circumstances\". Once Eloise is able to convince those that were incredulous as to their status at the reception of being at Table 19, they all slowly begin to open up about their misfit status, which leads to some issues which none of those seated at that table thought they would be discussing with anyone at the wedding let alone total strangers they just met. Foremost, they want to help Eloise find true happiness especially in light of her situation, that happiness which may include finding a mysterious white knight in shining armor at the reception that Eloise only knows as Huck, possibly to replace Teddy in her heart and life.",
