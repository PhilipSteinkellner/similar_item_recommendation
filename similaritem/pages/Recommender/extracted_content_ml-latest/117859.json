         "I'm a John Leguizamo fan but this one just fell kinda flat for me. It's partly based on John's own life, which becomes apparent because in the movie they have him being the star of such movies like CARLITO'S WAIT and EMPOWER. No I didn't spell that wrong, they couldn't afford to license the posters I guess for the real movies CARLITO'S WAY and EMPIRE so they had to change the names... Or it was made consciously just to say that the main character is just ALMOST John Leguizamo himself but not exactly, either way it doesn't matter. The life-story of \"ALMOST John Leguizamo\" Jesse simply is just not all that interesting, and it focuses too much on a love-story between him and RADHA MITCHELL. Radha who I usually really like as well, is not that at all great this time. In fact I found her character incredibly annoying and the chemistry between the two weren't hitting off, and since she's such a crucial part of the story this inevitably is what makes this movie fail. The movie often becomes tediously self indulgent at times as well. It's a dramacomedy I guess, that's not particularly dramatic nor funny. Not even the stand up comedy scenes which have the hired audience laughing on cue are funny. Better luck next time.",
         "It wasn't as bad as I expected it to be, but I still can't recommend you spend (or waste) your time on watching 'Fugly'. Bad acting, boring plot and just another one of those films that you forget everything about within an hour after you watched it. The plot is weak and does nothing for the movie itself. It felt like they were aiming for a dark comedy/romance type of plot, but for some reason it just didn't work out. There are a couple of funny lines here and there, but mostly the acting is downright awful with corny scripting. A thumbs up for the attempt at making their own style with the little cartoon animations. They could've implemented it better and more frequently through-out the movie, though. Overall it was slightly better than I thought it would be. I rarely tell people to skip movies, but this time I'll make an exception. Don't waste your time.",
         "I understand that John Leguizamo said something along the lines of this being an adult \"The Pest\". Well, sorry John, but \"The Pest\" was actually funny. There was a time when I would watch pretty much anything you were in. In recent years I've almost totally lost interest. And this movie may be the final straw. There are great films. Good films. And then there are the films that when they're over you wish you hadn't wasted your time. This film has its moments, but that's about all -- moments. I can't even find box office totals for this one. I did see on Rotten Tomatoes than a whopping 36% of those who viewed the film liked it (\"The Pest\" was liked by almost twice as many people). The difference here is that \"The Pest\" was about farting; \"Fugly!\" is about vulgar sex. This one is good for Leguizamo fans exclusively.",
         "Well this film delivers lows, there is very few highs in it, so even though Jesse visits at least one high in the film the watcher experience a lot of lows. The lows The story is too simple, it is not interesting to see a film where the plot is something you can see a mile away. The acting is not that good, well there are parts that are okay, but in general the people are losers, dumb even and that is what they put it in the acting, it becomes too bad. The highs I like the try to make it about his thoughts and imagination, the cartoons in it works very well and give a good sense of humor, but it is only very few times they appear. The times when Jesse is on stage actually works well, he seems to be happy and great, people like it in the film and the viewer gets the same impression. I think if they have made it more strange or make more fun of itself it would have worked much better for it. And they should have kept on with the cartoons and the weird imagination."

During a New Year's party, Jesse fakes a suicide attempt wrapping a retractable dog leash around his neck, accidentally knocks himself out, and sinks into the waters of his bathtub. Jesse gets the chance to reflect, possibly for the last time, upon his life and love. Known for his envelope pushing performances, Jesse's near death experience bends reality to stage and back again. He takes the audience across the universe of his life's greatest love stories, his quest for fame and the connection both play in understanding who he is underneath it all. With a bump on his head and a bruise on his heart, Jesse finds his way, reconciling with the fates, emerging from the tub to return to the stage a new man...well, at least a man with one hell of a story to tell.",
