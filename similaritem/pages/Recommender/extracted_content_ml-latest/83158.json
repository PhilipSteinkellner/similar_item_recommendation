         "Viewed at the Marche du Film, Festival de Cannes 2009 With not a lot of money but a bundle of ideas, director Simon Fellows and writer Jayson Rothwell, have come up with a massively entertaining twist on the classic tale, Alice in Wonderland. Only this time it's a young woman with amnesia, a taxi-driver, assorted gangsters, druggies and weirdos who feature. At the same time, Malice in Wonderland stays true to the novel on which its based, proving that old ideas can still be the best; same story, new version, as it were. Maggie Grace makes an interesting Alice, here a young American on the run from (and also towards) something, if only she knew what. Some of the dialogue between her and Whitey, the taxi driver, is excellent. Scratch that! A lot of the dialogue is excellent, with some great lines to cut out and keep for future use. It's clear that a low budget has been made to go a long way, but view it as a lot of bang for low bucks and not as cloth being cut too thinly. What surprises about this film is just how assured it is. Quibbles? Nothing of note, really. It would, theoretically, be nice to have seen what would have resulted had the production budget been higher, but then the film would perhaps have lost some, if not all, of its edge. As a calling card, Malice in Wonderland shows some real talent at work. The basic question, is it worth paying to see? Absolutely!",
         "I had never heard of this movie so I had no idea what to expect (other than some Alice in Wonderland reference), and I was pleasantly surprised. I only know Maggie Grace from her role as one of the worst characters on Lost, so I was also surprised that I could see her on film without hoping she'd get hit by a bus (I guess that means she's a good actress?) There are some truly zany characters in the movie, and you just have to roll with some of the situations, but all in all it kept me entertained from start to finish. I was kept involved enough in the story and travels of Alice that I really didn't see the ending revelation until it happened (most of the info was alluded to but never really exposed). I wouldn't call it a romance, or an action flick (although there are some violent scenes), it sort of defies description, but it's worth a watch.",
         "A fractured spin on the Alice In Wonderland story. I just watched this film and I was enchanted from start to finish. I highly recommend this film to anyone who has a twisted sense of humor. The characters were intriguing and the film kept me guessing, I didn't see the ending coming. Definitely worth seeing. Some excellent acting and concepts. Maggie Grace (Alice) And Danny Dyer (Whitey) both perform their rolls with excellence and they have a wonderful chemistry together. It Is definitely worth taking the time to watch this film, it's a confusing ride, but well worth it.",
         "As soon as the movie started i got the sense it would be good. I'm someone who can tell within the first ten minutes whether a movie will be worth watching. It was filmed in an awesome way. The story line was lovely, made me cry at the end. I remember thinking at the beginning- i hope the end is as beautiful as the movie begins. It was very twisty and unique. The main characters were authentic and the movie had a really beautiful ambiance about it. My boyfriend and I enjoyed it throughly. I was left with a really good feeling at the end of the movie. It is a movie which touched all of my emotions. There were some amazing characters throughout the movie- it's rarely that i see a movie where pretty much all the actors and actresses are on a par in terms of the quality they are bringing to the movie. The movie was throughly enjoyable to watch. I gave the movie 10 stars as i didn't find any faults in the movie at all and it lived up to my expectations.",
         "I don't usually write reviews, but I feel the negative reviews given to this film are quite biased and not objective. Most people hold to heart the traditional tale of the classic: \"Alice in Wonderland\". If you are one of these people and are expecting a nice, warm and fuzzy remake - please stay clear! This is not how this iteration is intended. This film is (to what I perceive) a cult twisted vision on what Alice in Wonderland might have been if she had ingested a little more than a bottle of shrinking potion and more like what you might buy on the streets of Amsterdam. Featuring hookers, gangsters, a Bob Marley wannabe (as the Caterpillar) and DJ Felix Chester as the Cheshire Cat, this twisted rehash is one that deserves its place next to the rest of the Alice in Wonderland legends.",
         "another sleeper hit for me i just finished watching this and from the reviews i have read this movie is very under rated. since i heard that Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland was coming out it has sent me on a spiral down the rabbit hole once again trying to find all movies about the twisted tale... This one definitely hit the mark with me pretty much all the characters from the original story are in there.. just with a twist.. If you don't like movies that make you think and spin you out like your on some sort of trip you wont like it But if you don't like tripper movies why are you watching alice in wonderland .. Tim Burton's gonna have to do some thing spectacular to beat this in my eyes but i suppose hes got a bigger budget and is aimed at kids to subconsciously send them into a drug fueled adolescence.. Circles Circles We all move in circles! .. bring back the mushies !!!!!... Wooooo hoooo!",
         "Malice in Wonderland kind of intrigued me because the idea and the thought of making a cockney-gangster version of the Alice in Wonderland story was a clever approach as I haven't heard of a version like it so it's unique. It could have went either way, it could have been something original yet different or it could have been a laughable idea that isn't interesting enough. Malice in Wonderland is pretty much the first. The story is clever yet average, it's clever the way they twisted the known tale of Alice but it didn't grip you in the first fifteen minutes, it took me about twenty minutes to actually get into the movie and no movie should take that long to get your attention. Even though it started quite slow, as time went on, it picked up the pace and started to get better. The acting is average, Danny Dyer plays Whitey (which is, as you've probably guessed, the equivalent to the White Rabbit) and yet again Danny Dyer is basically playing himself, as his character is the same as the other characters he's ever played in movies. However, Malice in Wonderland is the best he's ever been. The talent that shines throughout is the gorgeous Maggie Grace who plays the troubled twenty-year-old Alice. The characters were created cleverly to twist the characters in the story and added a hint of personality from the real world. The direction is done well and the cinematography is okay and it's clever the way they did it. I also loved how they borrowed some of the lines from the old movie and added them for the characters and I liked how it stuck to the original Alice in Wonderland plot and twisted it. Overall, I was on and off about it before watching but after watching, I ended up liking it. It's an above-average movie and I enjoyed it. It's such a brilliant translation and you would like this movie if you liked Alice in Wonderland. Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",
         "Though the film may lack a bit of depth, Malice in Wonderland is a visual treat that any fan of cinema or the Lewis Carroll stories can enjoy. Similar to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, Malice in Wonderland is a modern day take on the Alice and Wonderland story that begins with a young blonde girl running from henchmen who is suddenly hit by a cab driven by a snarky but charming man named \"Whitey\" (the white rabbit) causing her to lose her memory. In a rush, Whitey throws her in his cab and takes her through a long tunnel (the rabbit hole) into his world of gangsters, neon lights, and house music. The entire film revolves around this woman trying to figure out who she is, where she is, and where she needs to be. Along the way meeting a handful of interesting characters: the caterpillar, the mad hatter, the queen, etc. The characters are a bit subtle and usually not formally introduced so a quick peak at the trailer will give you a good idea of who is who if you need it. I found myself extremely entertained throughout the entire film. Visually, this movie is fun and beautiful. It's pretty well acted, especially for a low budget film. The pacing is fast and keeps you interested. Though the ending was a bit of a disappointment (I wont spoil anything) and the story overall lacked a bit of depth, compared to other Alice book to film adaptations this is definitely my favorite (and I've seen almost all of them except Tim Burton's). Definitely worth a watch! Go see it!",
         "The clock is ticking. So I won't hold you up for too long. Wonder what Lewis Carroll would think of this quirky, neon-laced, seamy urban British head spin of his classic story which sees American student Alice running through the London underpass to be hit by a cabbie when she reaches the surface. There she wakes up with no memory and finds herself interacting with strange and threatening underworld figures as she constantly pops pills in trying to figure out who she is and what she is all about. Jayson Rothwell ambitiously reinvented the material, like it was some jaded drug-trip with eccentric characters, brazen ideas and a wicked sense of humour while Simon Fellows' lean, over-stylised direction complements its distinctive look and keeps it on the move. It might seem aimless, but there's a purpose for the nocturnal journey (\"We all meet in circles\") and the twisted reinterpretations (the tea party is changed to a brothel) give it a fresh, if daring view. The performances are spot on. Maggie Grace is reputable as the naïve Alice and Danny Dyer is lively as Whitey the cabbie (the white rabbit). Nathaniel Parker is highly amusing in the villain role. The support features the likes of Matt King, Gary Beadle (cool as ever) and Bronagh Gallagher. Innovatively fragmented, but entrancing fantasy drama. \"Get ready for land that time forgot.\"",
         "I have got to say, when I picked this movie up out of BlockBusters, I didn't hold very high hopes for it, but I was thoroughly engrossed the moment I put it into my DVD player. I don't feel that the DVD cover fits in very well with the movie itself considering there are only two shootings, but I felt that apart from that it was very well made. Unfortunately, thanks to this small feature and the title of the film, my friends refuse to watch the wonder of this world with me. Bear in mind right now that I was the one who introduced them to the Hangover. I simply adored the methods used to put the traditional sense of 'Alice in Wonderland' into London. I must admit that my absolute favourite line was, \"She stole my tarts!\" I thought that was very clever personally, to be able to incorporate so many facets into the film. Well done!"
