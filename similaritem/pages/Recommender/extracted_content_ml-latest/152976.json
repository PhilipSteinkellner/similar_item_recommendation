Great to see Demi Moore again. I will happily watch it another day.",

            "content": "Traditional Treat.\r\n\r\nForsaken is directed by Jon Cassar and written by Brad Mirman. It stars Kiefer Sutherland, Donald Sutherland, Brian Cox, Michael Wincott, Aaron Poole and Demi Moore. Music is by Jonathan Goldsmith and cinematography by Rene Ohashi.\r\n\r\nThere's a group of words bandied around for this one such as generic, cliché and formulaic, and most assuredly these can not be argued about. For this is very much an old style traditional Western, the plot featuring a retired gunslinger being pushed into action again - while he tries to reconcile with his estranged father - is a hard core staple of 1950s Westerns. But what is wrong with having a traditional Western in this day and age as long as it's produced with skill and grace? The answer for Western lovers is nothing at all.\r\n\r\nThis is a beautifully mounted picture, fronted by father and son Sutherland's - which adds heartfelt emotion to their scenes together - and boosted by gorgeous cinematography (making it a Blu-ray must), it's a genre piece of worth. Crucially it knows what it wants to be, it has no pretence to be anything other than a traditional Oater for lovers of such. The villains are sneery and scenery chewers - apart from Wincott who is a gentleman dandy type - and the good guy is wonderfully broody and reflective. Pacing is fine, the story has good drama and the finale excites as we hope it should.\r\n\r\nIn summary, nothing new here of course (except maybe Cox's out of place language!), so expectation of such would be foolhardy, but a smashing Western it be. 7/10",

         "In the IMDb Guidelines for Top Reviewers, Rule 19 says that, when in doubt, be honest. So I will. I have no idea how most members do their ratings these days. But I do know that often the ratings make no sense. This is one example. This is a stellar western, borrowing the \"retired gunslinger\" theme from the 40s and 50s, the type of western that Glen Ford used to do best. The script is solid, the acting ditto. I mean, Brian Cox and Demi Moore in supporting roles. Wow. The elder Sutherland as always gets a little trapped in his one-dimensional character but the part was written for a character actor not a lead. The younger Sutherland effortlessly spans the full spectrum of emotions and holds the attention of the viewer like glue. And Wincott makes for one of the most articulate western villains in the history of the genre. The cinematography is stunning. Again, looking at the low IMDb rating, you would think there are so many quality westerns being made these days that viewers are overpowered by choice. Nope, that's not true. Is it? If I were grading on a Bell curve, this would be a 9. As it stands it gets a solid 8. Recommended.",
         "I grew up in the era when the western was king. I really love a great classic western and Forsaken brought me back using classic tropes that many seemed to see as clichés but I welcomed as old friends. The cinematography is gorgeous, the acting is stellar, especially the Sutherlands, Demi Moore and Michael Wincott. At it's heart this movie is a beautiful father and son story, more drama than action flick which is also something I appreciate. As one who has not particularly been drawn to the revisionist western of today, ( zombies? aliens? incredible disgusting violence and nastiness? ) Forsaken was a breath of fresh air.",
         "This is a slightly above-average western with great performances and directing but is a bit shallow on the story front. The plot is very ordinary and has a good amount of clichés. That being said, it wasn't a bad film at all. The performances from father/son duo Donald and Kiefer Sutherland were extraordinary. In fact, I think this might be Kiefer's best performance. I'll have to think about that, but there's one scene in particular that almost moved me to tears. The rest of the cast, like Brian Cox, are all great as well. The film had a lot of talent on the acting front. The actions scenes were all handled pretty well, surprisingly. They didn't feel low budget at all and were very intense towards the end. Overall, this film is nothing too special but it is worth a watch. I do recommend it just for the great cast. Don't expect anything too original, and you'll have a good time with this one. 6/10",
         "It's a slow drive that ends with a sudden violent car crash, like a good western should. Kiefer Sutherland plays a soldier who waited far too long after the war to put down his guns, but something tragic hits him hard, and he tries to change his ways, with the help of his father, played by Sutherland's real life father, Donald Sutherland who plays a small town preacher who disapproved of the life his son once lead, and is threaten to get back into when a banker tries to buy out the town by any means necessary. It's a very typical western story made timeless by it's focus on being character driven. I don't know if this is the first time Kiefer and Donald have done a movie together, but it must have help with the relationship between their characters. But my favorite interaction was between Kiefer's John Henry and Michael Wincott's Dave Turner, who plays a rival gunslinger hired to influence town people off their land. The mutual respect these men showed for each other despite being on different sides of the coin was masterful, something I never seen done so well in a western. Brian Cox was also in the movie playing the banker that hired Dave Turner. His role as James McCurdy is what tells us that this timeless Western was made in 2015, because he's all about taking people's homes who don't want to leave, and his level of cold heartiness is done brilliantly, reflected this day and era. Though I'm sure she was trying to due some respectable acting in this film, Demi More is still some impressive eye candy. The story is nothing out of the ordinary, but it's strengthen by a great set of actors doing their thing, lead by father and son team Sutherland. Good western.",
         "If you're a fan of the genre, there isn't a single plot beat in FORSAKEN that you haven't seen many times over. In most instances, you'll probably be able to deduce what's going to happen next, or even what the next line is going to be. That said, I still enjoyed the movie a good deal, primarily due to the beautiful locations, and Donald Sutherland's exceptional performance in what could have been a thankless, cut-out role. Kiefer, in full-on Kiefer mumbly mode fails to impress, but it's still interesting to see the father-son duo share the screen. I'd give it a 6.5 if I could, but since I can't, I usually round up.",
         "Although this movie was done before by different actors, the whole drifter son who returns back in town, where ornery blokes are driving the town people out by using unsavory tactic to take possession of their property and land. Keifer returns to his father's home Donald, filled with a guilt of his past, only to realize that there are those who sometimes will not allow to forget it. I gotta say, the Sutherlands did a decent job on screen as a father and son duo, in which neither out stood the other in neither script or performance. Cox, WIncott and Moore, were also great co stars. In this film again, that has been done before. What moved me was the scene in the church were Keifer breakdowns and confesses his guilt to his father, who walks in on him talking to God, in whom Keifer never really believed in. That part had me little teary eyed. And of course end the retribution is handed down to those who have terrorized the towns people, and we all fill good at the end of the film. Cliché? yes. But a good cliché none the less, that stands the test of time and to see a father son duo do it so well, then I say we need more cliché films to enjoy.",
         "There has been a number of westerns being released recently, from the excellent Bone Tomahawk, The Hateful Eight & the Revenant to the decent Diablo. The Forsaken doesn't compare with the greats, but is still an excellent old style Western. The problem with this, is that it will be judged for being to old fashioned. If not for the swearing by the great Brian Cox, this is a Western that could have been made in the 60's with Glenn Ford or Randolph Scott. All performances are excellent, and the reviewer saying that Kiefer Sutherland overacted, he must have been watching another movie. Donald Sutherland is equally as good as his father. Michael Wincott is also worth mentioning, in a memorable role as a hired gun. He seems to be channelling Val Kilmer in Tombstone. As mentioned before, Brian Cox is excellent as the villain, using up the films swear quota. The only poor lead role is Demi Moore, which is not down to her acting, but limited screen time and development. Still give her points for not being vain and letting her grey hair show through. The plot isn't the most original, but gets the job done. Jon Cassar does a great job of directing and the Canadian scenery that is used looks terrific.",
         "I wish I could save this movie but, sincerely, it is not that great. The plot is the usual, the good-hardened man who returns home from war to redeem himself. The usual very nasty guys who take advantage of expropriating people lands. Obviously the never forgotten ex-girlfriend, by this time married, which is in difficulties and ask for help. The good-hardened man that is brought (beyond measure) to the predictable despair. The only nice thing about the movie are some good actors but, mainly the relationship between Sutherland father and son that it is interesting to see acting together in their \"real\" roles. Otherwise a mediocre film, just a good set and a couple of moving scenes but overall a forced series of clichés from start to finish. By not considering the recent eccentric \"The Hateful Eight\" or the particular \"The Revenant\", if you want to see a good - usual - now day western, then \"The Salvation\" or mostly \"The Dark Valley\" are on other level. Just watchable 6/10",
         "Like Kirk and Michael Douglas, Donald and Kiefer Sutherland waited far too long to team up for a film. Forsaken casts them as a frontier preacher and his gunfighter son who wants to give it up and settle down and work the family farm with dad. But there's a lot that has passed between them, a lot of misunderstanding and judgmental behavior ever since Kiefer went off to war and didn't return. He also left behind Demi Moore who up and married Christopher Rosamond and has a son with him. This is an old fashioned western in its villains because back when all those poverty row studios were churning out B westerns the way Ford did Model Ts, the town banker in New Deal Days was always the villain. Brian Cox portrayed this villainous town banker with real relish, stopping short of twirling the mustache like Snidely Whiplash. Donald played a three dimensional preacher with both faults and strengths and resisted the temptation to make his role a caricature. Kiefer Sutherland is a Jimmy Stewart like western hero who the locality depends on to be the strong man who stands up to the villains. Like in John Wayne's classic El Dorado, Cox like villain Edward Asner in El Dorado doesn't use a gun, he 'hires it done'. Cox has a stable of gunfighters to enforce his will, but one of them is a professional played by Michael Wincott. Wincott and Sutherland have a mutual respect between professionals the way John Wayne had with Christopher George in El Dorado. For those who like old fashioned westerns like me, Forsaken is your type of film.",
         "In the last few years I have watched pretty much all the newly made westerns. They all lack the old western feel. I walk away disappointed and time wasted. Finally The Sutherlands done it right! The background music right from the start put me in the mood to watch this one. I liked the way Kiefer played the main character. IMO he was one of the best actors to play the leading role in this western. For all the western fans out there I don't think you will be disappointed when you watch \"Forsaken\" Hats off to the directors of this film. This movie is not perfect (we always like to see more lol) but I give this western movie a solid 10 out of 10 compared to the westerns I have watched since 2000. Cheers",
         "It's refreshing that in an age populated by revisionist westerns and snazzy new takes on the ancient genre, some filmmakers just want to play it straight and deliver a good old oater without any newfangled bells and whistles. Jon Cassar's Forsaken does just that, arriving a few years late (turbulent post production issues) but in modest, simple form, here to tell the age old tale of one man who stands up to some evil frontier bankers with stoic heroism. Kiefer Sutherland is John Henry Clayton, a man who has been away from his quiet hometown for nearly a decade. Following a traumatic stint in the war, circumstance led him into the life of the gunfighter. His unannounced return home stirs up old wounds in his preacher father (Donald Sutherland) who cringes in the very presence of his violent aura. John has thrown down the guns and sworn never to pick them up again, but we all know that just ain't true, and when he meets a certain group of unsavory dudes in town, he becomes a time bomb of righteous anger that's liable to go off any time. He spends some time mourning his mother and reconnecting with a lost love (Demi Moore), until the inevitable conflict brews. Corrupt banker James McCurdy (Brian Cox) is buying up farms and forcing families who don't want to sell off their land, using despicable methods carried out by his two goons, vicious Frank Tillman (Aaron Poole) and mercurial 'Gentleman' Dave Turner (Michael Wincott). Tensions arise and everyone finds themselves headed for an unavoidable and blistering conclusion. Kiefer always has a jagged rage simmering just below the surface, which is what made him so perfect as Jack Bauer, another time bomb. He's downright implosive here, delivering the best work I've ever seen him give. He's got a touching scene with his father in which he goes to places I didn't know he was capable of in his work. Donald is quiet, resentful and compassionate, wrestling internally to keep his serenity in the face of injustice. Cox always puts on a good show as the villain, and he's exactly what he needs to be here: bureaucratic menace with just a dash of swagger. It's Wincott who steals the show though, with the best work in the film. He inhabits Dave (and his incredibly dapper costume) with a relaxed, lupine calm, punctuated by sudden bursts of danger and always presided over by the midnight black, raspy croon of a voice that makes him so special. He jaunts along the line between villain and sympathetic antihero so well, the only character in the film to shirk the archetypes, and I was please try reminded of Jason Robard's Cheyenne from Once Upon A Time In The West. His best work in a while as well, but then he's always perfect. The film is refreshingly violent in its gunplay, with an earned brutality that never feels gratuitous, and always satisfying. The production took place in wildest alberta, a trip worth the taking for the breathtaking scenery we get to feast on, especially in an opening credit sequence that is very reminiscent of Eastwood films of yesteryear. It's a landmark in the sense that although both Kiefer and Donald have been in the same film before (Joel Schumacher's underrated A Time To Kill) they never have shared the same frame until now. Trust me, it was worth the wait. They are both excellent, along with their peers in a simple, honest to goodness Western film that should please fervent fans of the genre and moviegoers alike.",
         "There's deliberate pacing in this old-fashioned type Western, but I thought it was quite well presented and absorbing. The acting was top- notch with believable characters, a good script from Brad Mirman, and able direction by Jon Cessar. We've seen many of the plot elements here in varying degrees over the years with a vile and greedy land baron forcing the townspeople of Fowler to sell their land to him, with the knowledge that the railroad will be coming to their town soon. The fine veteran actor Brian Cox plays the land baron McCurdy, who employs a gang of violent goons to make sure the land owners sell to him. Aaron Poole is very believable as the sadistic Frank, who heads up McCurdy's mob, and Michael Wincott does well as Gentleman Dave, also in McCurdy's employ but has a whole different style of getting the job done. Amidst all this turmoil, Keifer Sutherland, as John Henry Clayton, is returning to Fowler for the first time in 10 years. His psyche was severely damaged in the Civil War and he has spent the last eight years carving a violent and checkered path across the country. All of that much to the chagrin of his father the local Reverend William Clayton, portrayed by Donald Sutherland, who's a strong believer in God and non- violence. I might note that it was good to see Demi Moore back on the screen, giving a most solid performance as Mary Alice, who loves John Henry and waited for him to return from the War, but eventually married and now has a son. Overall, you can for the most part, but not entirely, predict which way this movie is going, but I thought it was very well presented, and I would recommend it to those viewers who like this genre of film.",
         "Cliché is the word that absolutely describes this movie. Imagine all western common places and you get this movie spot on! Nothing here is a surprise. Sutherland, the son, does not have what it takes to hold the movie. His performance is bland and has a conflicted tough action guy he leaves a lot to desire. All the time I got the impression I has watching a bad Bruce Willis impersonation, brrrr! And it only got worse when the long-last ex girlfriend end up to be Demi Moore. Did the producers wish they had Willis? Some catching phrases also seem taken almost literally from Die Hard's script. In the ending scene, I just laugh. The always-the-same narration over the image of the \"hero\" horseback riding to the horizon has he leaves town after saving everybody's live... LAME. I didn't care about him. He just wasn't THAT type of hero. The movie misses everything that could make it agreeable. Performances, scenery or direction AREN'T enough to help it. It's a forgettable one. Solid performances from «the villains» and Sutherland - the father, though.",
         "Forsaken is mostly a standard fare of classic western film tropes strung together to form a not so original story. Yet for hard core western fans it ends up being a relatively watchable one none the less. People here have talked about the grandeur of the cinematography in this movie though what we get in that respect is somewhat minimal and not terribly impressive by any western standard. If you're looking for a western with cinematography to appreciate check out 2015's The Revenant (the acting is far better as well), or even the most recent remake of The Magnificent Seven. I'm sure a lynch party will be formed soon after reading this, but I honestly believe the films' main draw here is the Sutherland father and son team. Regrettably I have to say, it's not that great of a match, at least not in this particular story. While I am aware Keifer Sutherland built up a strong following with his television success, he really doesn't seem to play this character to that credit and what we get from him feels closer to the character he played in the classic late 80s movie Young Guns, all those years ago. Not to take away from Michael Wincott's performance as Gentleman Dave Turner in this film, but I couldn't help feeling during the course of watching that he might have been more suitable for the lead instead of Keifer. It is simply the kind of clichéd story that just required a stronger lead (as well as screenplay) and perhaps some juxtaposed flashbacks of that lead's less civilized days. At least in this case. Overall, fans of the classic western style won't be too disappointed, but at the same time, shouldn't really be very impressed either and if they are they probably haven't seen enough well done westerns. IMDb doesn't allow 1/2 stars, so it bumps up to a semi solid 6/10.",
         "I love Westerns! The Donald and Keifer Sutherland tandem here was irresistible and made this a must watch for me and it did not disappoint. Here is a heart warming tale about a prodigal son who was lost to the world and comes home 10 years after going off to war. The son haunted by a decade of wayward wandering and misdeeds. The father trying to overcome the bitterness of losing his family and community piece by piece. Throughout the movie is a pleasant, persistent but not overbearing theme of how God works through his servants to achieve His divine will. Fans of the genre will enjoy all the classic elements that make Westerns great. There is a scene in the church between father and son that had such raw powerful emotion it made me cry tears. Gentleman Dave Turner, played by Michael Wincott is my new favorite anti-hero. If you like Westerns you'll love FORSAKEN. Well done!!!",
         "The best father-son film I have ever seen. Younger Sutherland delivers arguably his best performance ever which I am guessing is confidence with sharing the screen with his dad. The older Sutherland has a more typical role something like he has been performing over the years but the variety of emotions displayed by his son are captivating. Like any typical western, the ending is more or less predictable but this movie is not about the final chapter but more about a father and son's relationship in difficult times and no one could have done it better than these two. Definitely not to be missed if you are into emotional family flicks.",
         "Blockbuster classic westerns are, of course, past-tense. If you still crave a good one you won't care as long as it respects the genre. Forsaken is a modest nod to the classics with many elements of those woven in. The story is anything but original, and the cast plays it straight and low-key. Overall it works. Keifer Sutherland and Donald play a father and son reunited after a decade of exile due to deeply held differences. The occasion is a visit to see the ailing matriarch who has died before her son has returned unknown to him. Both Sutherlands are pros and they don't overplay their roles, bringing a bit of real angst underpinning both's desire for reconciliation. With the elder's disdain for violence, he's the town's preacher, and the son's penchant for gunslinging, he's renowned as man not to be trifled with, their division couldn't seem wider. This will be a dilemma put the test by the town fat cat who seeks to buy out the locals prior to the arrival of the railroad. His henchmen are plying their trade of murder to achieve their employer's goal. This, of course, puts John Henry Clayton, who has laid down his arms in a bid to make peace with his father, in a situation he can't extricate himself from. Those who want to fault modesty in movies may turn away. I'd say they're missing out, as well as missing the point. This is like an ensemble cast and reverent director tipping their hats to the great westerns of all time in a purposely stripped down story. What it lacks in complexity and originality it makes up for in reverent simplicity. The backdrop of a west past is beautifully photographed. The roles portrayed seem right - even as the role the boss's right hand man, Dave, seems strange but will win one over by the ominous tone the fine actor Michael Wincott brings (he narrates a bit too). All in all, this is a small-scale enjoyable for those who appreciate the classics.",
         "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In 1872, gunslinger John Henry Clayton (Kiefer Sutherland) returns home from battle, hoping to mend bridges with his father, the Reverend William Clayton (Donald Sutherland), who disapproved of his life of violence. William coldly tells his son that his mother is dead, and things don't look like they'll shape up any time soon. But John Henry may have a chance to redeem himself when he crosses paths with a gang of brutes, led by the ruthless James McCurdy (Brian Cox), who are trying to force landowners out of their homes in order to get a big railway track built. It can often be the case that something that might have first of had potential many years ago doesn't have the same impact if it happens today. The pairing of legendary actor Donald Sutherland and his not so legendary (but still something of a *24* cultural icon) son Kiefer might have rocked the world ten/twenty years ago, but today it seems their pairing only amounts to this underwhelming little addition to the gently re-emerging western genre, that has all the right ingredients but no recipe to give it its own spice. Forsaken plays like the textbook genre training manual, plodding through by the numbers, and ticking off every cliché as it goes along. It's the most standard, uninspiring old west screenplay you can imagine, that never dares to deviate from the standard formula. Performances wise, lead star Sutherland has no meat to chew on in a largely emotionless role, but such is the weakness of the script that even a tearful confessional in the church doesn't have the impact it could have. Sutherland Sr. has a quiet dignity as his pious father, while Cox has his usual air of menace as the villain, which you know he is as he's the only character to keep saying 'f**king' over and over. With a further support cast in the shape of Michael Wincott and Demi Moore as the love interest, there's certainly no shortage of talent. It's all okay if you want something to just gently relax to, but a big letdown for those who like their westerns more dynamic. **",
         "overall the movie was good the relationship between father and son was good. The story line though well worn was OK. G Good actors but farmers they are not. a couple of nit pics Once you fell a tree with an axe -- cut the branches up with a saw whacking a small branch with a axe for no apparent reason seemed staged. while you are digging out the stump there is no need to chop at it with the axe -- you already cut the tree down. after you plow the field you harrow it or at least rake it to smooth the ground but you do not seed the furrows. Overall the movie was really OK. they really should have consulted a farmer though.",
         "Just screened at TIFF. A paint-by-numbers movie that lacks finesse let alone originality. Every hoary western movie trope + cliché - and then some. Downright ridiculous at times. Kiefer Sutherland wasn't bad - just the material he was handed. Father Donald clearly understood the dilemma as his performance was on autopilot. Demi Moore was actually OK-ish in spite of obviously being the director's idea of stunt casting. Michael Wincott did the least-affected work with arguably the most affected character - he also got to be beautifully dressed (as every gentleman killer with a code of honour should). Cameron Bailey introduced the film as a uniquely \"Canadian western\". I understood how sly he was being about half-way through the screening. Good news; it was only 90 minutes long. In conclusion, rent 'Unforgiven' if you want to see how it is supposed to be done.",
         "This was a good movie, it had a good story, the movie as a whole wasn't stretched out too long, it had some good acting, and the fact that real life father and son played father and son in the movie was just a great idea. It does feel like it drags on at times, and it kind of makes you sit on the edge of your seat waiting for the good guys to start standing up for themselves but it is something that is completely necessary for the story. The bad guy does drop the F bomb a few times, which I suppose isn't breathtaking but it feels out of place because that it is the only swear word spoken in the entire movie by a single person, multiple times, so it actually feels out of place. So here you have a guy dropping the F bomb and nobody reacts to it, not sure if they get it, don't get it and its one of those things where there is either too much swearing or not enough because its only one word by one person. I like the movie though and if I were to compare it to anything I think Clint Eastwoods Unforgiven would be a good comparison. If you liked that movie then you will definitely like Forsaken.",
         "Brooding, intense, and dreary, Forsaken is an old fashioned Western told in an old fashioned way. A former Civil War soldier returns home after a series of ill-defined violent exploits only to be met with a deceased mother and a disappointed father. Eager for redemption, though not sure how to find it, he soon finds himself in the midst of another bloody conflict. Sound familiar? Yes, but the execution proves too good to write off. Though there are some clichéd motifs, to be sure, the film still feels authentic and offers some of the best acting in a genre that unfortunately has become awash in straight-to-DVD mediocrity. The characterizations are liking in some parts, yet their emotional integrity and presence is nearly visceral in this film\u2014with an all- star ensemble cast featuring real-life father and son combo Kiefer and Donald Sutherland, Brian Cox, and Michael Wincott. Besides the acting, the film itself is restrained, with a slow build. Thought it has a short run-time, it never feels rushed, the action beats feel earned, and the ending resonates with the nearly poetic vibe of the film. Narratively it may seem slight, yet the parts work too well to be ignored in Forsaken. 3.5/5 Stars",
         "I know there is a new sheriff in town when it comes to Westerns. This isn't one of them and quite frankly, I'm thankful. This is a throwback Western. A Western plucked from the golden age of Glenn Ford, John Wayne, Alan Ladd, Jimmy Stewart, and Henry Fonda. It also has some of the feel of more recent movies like Open Range with Duvall and Costner. Beautiful scenery that was beautifully shot. Good acting, good cast, good story, and for me a dark, but very effective score. I'd give it a 9, but there are very few 9's out there. Without the extraneous use of \"f...\" by one character 7 or 8 times this would have been a movie that families could watch together with their teens. Michael Wincott played a most likable bad guy, true to his name in this film. In the Western genre, its a home run in my book. Glad the Sutherlands finally made one together.",
         "I watched this because I am a huge Kiefer Sutherland fan so I have been looking forward to this movie coming out. I will also say I am not a western fan. This movie kept me drawn in because it was not a cheesy western and actually had a plot line. I enjoyed the chemistry between the Sutherlands and there were parts that you really felt the \"acting\" was genuine. You will know these parts when you see them. The cinematography was gorgeous! The music that went along with the movie was also perfect as well. The movie is a good ole western with a modern feel to it.",
         "(Originally published on Blogcritics) Forsaken is the first film to co-star father and son actors Donald and Kiefer Sutherland as father and son. That's the hook, but there is way more to this western than anyone would expect, although a glance at the credits of the director, writer, and impressive supporting cast should give you a hint that this is an exceptional film. The Story The story, on the surface, seems deceptively simple and one any fan of westerns has seen a dozen times. The railroad is coming and a corrupt business man is using a bunch of thugs to force farmers to sell their land to him. But to leave the description there would be like saying High Noon was about a town's law enforcement human resources problems. Set in 1872 Wyoming, the story begins as John Henry Clayton, played by Kiefer Sutherland (24, L.A. Confidential, The Lost Boys), returns home from the Civil War; only it's ten years later than everyone was expecting him. Everyone includes his father, the Reverend Clayton, played by Donald Sutherland (The Hunger Games, The Italian Job, MASH), and his former girlfriend, Mary-Alice, played by Demi Moore (A Few Good Men, G.I. Jane, Ghost). John Henry's father, the Reverend, is bitter, and his former girlfriend has moved on, but his problems run deeper than that. During his ten lost years John Henry continued to use the lethal skills he'd learned in the war, earning a reputation as a gunfighter. He tries to leave that behind, reestablish a life in his old home, and rebuild his relationships. The Filmmakers Director Jon Cassar (24, The Kennedys, La Femme Nikita (1997)) and Writer Brad Mirman (The Good Shepherd, Joshua, Highlander: The Final Dimension) bring John Henry's struggle to life through finely crafted words, beautiful cinematography, and touching symbolism. The music by Jonathan Goldsmith is also exceptional. Cassar does a lot with looks and symbols. His actors get to act, not just repeat the lines. But the lines that Mirman provided them are excellent. The film begins with a shocking scene of violence that we won't understand until much later. That is followed by and contrasted to John Henry riding home through settings that suggest an idyllic country life. The very first words we hear spoken are from the Reverend Clayton, who upon seeing his son for the first time in ten years says, \"Your Mother is dead.\" Shortly thereafter Mirman clues us in to the theme of the film, when, after noticing that his son is no longer wearing his six guns, Reverend Clayton comments, \"I don't know if a man can get away from who he is.\" The Cast The supporting cast which helps John Henry answer that question includes a variety of antagonists. Dave Turner, played by Michael Wincott (The Crow, Alien: Resurrection, 1492: Conquest of Paradise), is a Southerner who fought in many of the same battles that John Henry did, but on the other side. He has embraced the gunslinger life from which John Henry seeks to escape and provides a mirror into which John Henry can gaze. Brian Cox, who played the first screen incarnation of Hannibal Lecter in Manhunter, is the businessman who is driving people off their land. He is a devil-like corrupting influence to all around him. Kiefer Sutherland enters the saloon to fight half a dozen bad guys. The head of the thugs is played by Landon Liboiron (Hemlock Grove, The Howling: Reborn, Terra Nova). His creepy visage personifies yet a third kind of evil, ignorant and sadistic. The rest of the cast does a fine job as well, with even minor characters having impressive credits. Violent Yet Spiritual When Forsaken gets down to fistfights and gun fire, it does not spare the blood. Yet, above all, it is a spiritual and intimate film. Set in a world separated from us by over a hundred years, the questions it asks about loyalty, morality and family are timeless. It explores human nature, community and violence. And, did I mention that it's a kick- ass western with Kiefer and Donald Sutherland? Forsaken is rated \"R\" for violence and language. It opens in theaters and VOD on February 19."
