         "I recently was in the lucky position to watch three documentaries on video games in rather short succession (Get Lamp, Indie Game: The Movie, and Minecraft: The Story of Mojang). In this trifecta, Get Lamp has to probably be the odd man out, since Indie Game and Minecraft revolve around recently released indie games, whereas Get Lamp presents itself more like a nostalgic retrospection. Still, out of those three, Minecraft, I am afraid to say, turns out to be the weakest - for a variety of reasons. The movie documented facts and events after Minecraft had circulated the internets, turning out to be a tremendous success and having created an immense fan base. This may be partially due to the fact, that the film was founded through Kickstarter and thus needed some time until it was in the clear financially (I am not familiar with the exact details, though). The thing with Minecraft is, however, that the game is probably the most thoroughly documented gaming phenomenon on the internet (being responsible for numerous Let's Players and game commentators on YouTube) � those videos alone vividly depict the endless possibilities Minecraft has to offer and are able to make you understand why it turned out to be the phenomenon it is, even if you are not familiar with the game itself. So what does this documentary add? Well, other than Indie Game, which focused on the people behind the games, their relation to what they were doing, and the reason why they did it or do it, Minecraft basically renders Markus Persson as a nice guy who simply lucked out making a game that he thought would be cool to play himself. Period. And then moves on to all the other aspects that are the Minecraft phenomenon � all of which, however, you are able to witness yourself first-hand by using your internet connection. Do I need a documentary to inform me about the existence of The Shaft or Yogscast? Or that Persson founded a company and is working on a new game? The most insightful comments are probably Peter Molyneux's in which he explains why he thinks Minecraft is such a big hit and discloses the fact that Minecraft played a role in him founding yet another game dev studio. Guys, seriously, for having Peter Molyneux, Tim Schafer, and Jonathan Blow (although he just makes a very brief appearance) available for interviews, these are pretty meager yields. For fans of the game it absolutely may be interesting to see more of the people behind the game (especially 'Notch' Persson � and it is good to see that he has remained a likable, down-to-earth guy, despite being responsible for possibly one of *the* gaming sensation of this decade), for the average gamer or documentary aficionado, however, this might be too little. Where Indie Game was able to tell a captivating story about the minds behind the games, Minecraft is asking the right people the wrong questions and leaves the viewer with an unsorted array of factoids about the phenomenon that is Minecraft.",
         "Just finished watching the film and all I can say was, inspirational. The film takes you on a journey from how the game first started and carries you through this parallel to the journey of notch, the creator of the game It shows how one single man built nothing short of an empire. It gives real inspiration to those who are indie game developers or anyone who has a dream. Even if you aren't a Minecraft fan I can't see you could walk away from this without feeling that little bit of inspiration. It shows how the games popularity increasing grew through the last year. Giving views of those from the public as well as those who have supported Minecraft. Game developers give their humble opinions and talk about how Minecraft has made them go on to view game design and development in a different way. It's great for those die hard Minecraft fans and a soon as I'd seen the credits roll all I wanted to do is log in and start playing. If you've never heard of Minecraft, this will make you want to at least try it, but even for a causal or non-gamer this inspiring and collective journey will leave a warm and fuzzy feeling inside. Nothing short of fantastic. 2PP has done a great job.",
         "A very good movie for a all technology lovers and certainly all of the Minecraft fans (such as myself) will enjoy this film. We get to learn about the Minecraft creators and their story and how they got here. did they really expect this amount of love and attraction around the game or not. one interesting point of this movie was Notch. I personally could not believe how humble and normal he was. as he said himself , he makes games of the sake of games and because it is what he enjoys doing. he decided to create 'Mojan'. because Minecraft was getting too big and a company to represent was needed. we see how that happens, and what people are hired to help expand the game. Notch was able to create a game in his spare time and went on and became one of the greatest and most popular games ever made. and the fact that people can't decide between Minecraft and super Mario shows that. I'd personally pick Minecraft. the movie shows how Minecraft takes a role in education. and how kids (and adults) can learn to create things using Minecraft. that was quite interesting for me because I was not aware that this was happening. we also get to see amazing maps and locations that has been created by users and feel all the love and excitement around the game. A great film if you are a Minecraft fan; or just a fan of being creative! 8/10",
         "compared to Indie Game the Movie this video game documentary falls a little short. It doesn't focus on the developers mojang for much of the movie and even when Notch and the other developers are being interviewed there isn't much conflict in trying to make a video game since Minecraft was already a success when they started to film this. A movie like Indie Game the Movie is a great video game documentary because you see the struggle the developers have to go through to go after their dreams. With this it just shows how if there is no conflict there is no reason for you to care. Interesting but nothing to write home about.",
         "This movie is a real and unique look at the development of one of the decades best computer games. Having played Minecraft for a year before the release date, I was thrilled that the movie followed the game development during this time. The movie flows along through the different stages of the games development and really shows that the staff are on their own journey and have no idea where they will end up. The interviews with the staff of Mojang were very insightful and informative. Also I especially enjoyed the interviews with the various gaming experts and developers especially Peter Molyneux who offered his own take on the development of computer gaming. This is not really a movie for someone who plays Solitaire, but I highly recommend it to anyone who plays or has an interest in computer games and their history.",
         "This is a documentary on the company that made Minecraft which is Mojang. If you have never played Minecraft then this documentary will make you want to pretty badly. I for one have played Minecraft and it is by far one of the most funnest indie games i have ever played. This documentary gives you a outstanding look on what went on and how it was made. I in my own way could have add some things but in all this documentary said it all. Also if you are a gamer or Minecraft player you will enjoy this documentary at most because it goes behind how a small place can make such a big game and how some companies can get started for a slow or fast perspective."
