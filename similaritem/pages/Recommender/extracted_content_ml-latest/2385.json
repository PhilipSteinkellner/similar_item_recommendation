         "I just caught this movie on cable, this was the first time I saw it. I remember seeing the adverts for it and thinking it looked mildly interesting, but that it was a piece of romantic comedy fluff that I could wait and rent or something and watch at home without inflicting $20 in movie tickets and an evening of \"Chick Flick\" on my Husband. BOY! I wish I'd slipped a tape in, cause he would've loved it!!! It was definitely a movie worth full admission in a theatre. The Marketing Department, apparently didn't watch the movie, they sold it all wrong. I have noticed an increasing trend in that direction, I've skipped some because the marketing made them look AWFUL only to find out they were real gems. If you are in the mood for skillful mix of mystery, romantic comedy, and dark humour then I strongly recommend you rent this movie, or catch it on Cable.",
         "This looks like a case of a classic schizophrenic Hollywood movie--too dark-humored for fans of romantic comedy, not nearly outrageous enough for those looking for that quality. (You may get a little nervous, though, when a shotgun-wielding character walks into a fast-food restaurant full of kids.) Consequently it will end up alienating a lot of viewers looking for the one type of film or the other. Most of the characters aren't very enjoyable to watch, with the noted exception of Drew Barrymore in the lead. I was disappointed that Catherine O'Hara's part wasn't any better--she could have really livened the movie up if her character had been a little more forceful. Despite all the problems, there was still something left to like here, and I would give it a positive recommendation, but just barely. On second thought, recommending this movie to someone would be a risky proposition, but I thought that overall it was marginally successful.",
         "This was a black comedy that unfolded over the first 30 minutes of the film, revealing one surprise relationship after another, until you realize that all the major characters are related in surprising ways. My daughter and I watched this together and laughed out loud quite a bit. Luke Wilson did a great job as the moony eyed helicopter pilot who falls for Drew's character. Drew did a good job as a confused but sweet pregnant girl who works at a burger joint in somewhere in small town America. Jake Busey looks a whole lot like his dad, and chewed a lot of furniture for this role, which was rather one dimensional. Catherine O'Hara is at her best playing this quirky mom. (during one funny scene, the older boy asks her if it's true that she liked the other son better...\"I love you both, she says, but the difference is only this (puts her fingers an inch apart) much!LOL!!!) If you don't enjoy dark humor, this will not amuse you. It also had an ending that made us go \"awww\"...it was almost as if they weren't sure how to end this one, though. Overall, it wasn't a bad film.",
         "I had gone to see this movie because I really enjoy Drew Barrymore's acting. I ended up liking more than just Drew's part though. I thought it was a unique movie with just the right amount of humour - keeping it far from slapstick, but generated a light atmosphere that kept everyone level with the innocence of it all. I'd definitely recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind and a sense of humour.",
         "This movie with Luke Wilson (brother of Owen Wilson) & Drew Barrymore is very enjoyable. While it was promoted as a Romantic Comedy, it should be noted that this has a darker comedic theme with some action sequences. If you were looking for a Meg Ryan/Tom Hanks movie, reset your expectations and rent this one anyways. It is a very enjoyable, fun movie.",
         "I would have given this film a '10', except that I believe that the manner in which it was marketed is a flaw. Similar to the way that films like \"Love Serenade\", or \"Muriel's Wedding\" were not presented as outrageous and offbeat comedies this film's preview and sleeve present it as if it is another main stream romantic comedy (like \"You've Got Mail\"). It is in fact a wonderfully deranged and outrageous film that could easily be mistaken for a Cohen (sp?) brothers movie.",
         "How does that work? Well. . .it does, and it doesn't. It's kind of strange, because this movie wasn't terribly complicated, but I'm still not sure what to make of it. So here's my tentative review: it's weird in a weird way. I mean, there are funny weird movies, and fun weird movies, and disgusting weird movies, and experimental weird movies, and mindless weird movies- and \"Home Fries\" is somehow none of those, either by an inch or by a mile. It's worth watching, don't get me wrong, but my feelings on this movie are uncharacteristically ambiguous. Drew is great, of course- she almost always is. I grew up in a tiny, Southern town, so I can vouch that the atmosphere seemed authentic. Luke Wilson is a charmingly unusual hero. Catherine O'Hara is funny as his psycho mother, and the Busey kid chews the scenery with both gusto and some amazing choppers, each obviously inherited from his dad. Some of the dialogue was really good, and there was a lot about this flick that was nicely understated. But overall...well, I occasionally get the urge to watch it again (because I like strange movies, and \"Home Fries\" is possessed of a strangeness I've never quite seen before,) but it certainly won't wear out before most of my other tapes. That, I guess, is the simplest and most honest review I can give it.",
         "Telling you the plot would kinda take away some of the suprising charm of this movie. Basically, the Drew Barrymore character is supposed to be killed by the son of the dead man she was sleeping with. But the guy starts to like her. There are several other twists thrown into the story. The screenplay by Vince Gilligan of the X-Files is unpredictable and the dialogue isn't stale like in so many other Hollywood films. Great performances by all.",
         "**contains spoilers** well first off, id like to start with the fact that it was an entertaining and sweet movie.. the trailer portrays it as an entirely different movie... i watched the trailer after watching the movie and was like WOAH.. the trailer sets it up as a romantic comedy in which luke wilson sees drew barymore at a drive thru and wants to get a job there in order to meet her.. the movie is quite the contrary.. it is more like a physchotic mother who made her kids kill her cheating husband (with drew) and then luke wilson takes the job there because they know she heard something on the headphones.. yes he does fall in love with her.. and the lamaz scene is adorable, and the ending is sweet.. but theres murder and a twisted family that they left from the trailer... but i can say that that it was worth the $5.88 i payed for it.. its a simple, cheesy teen-flick.. with a bit of a twist.. i enjoyed it..",
         "This a wonderful movie. Full of laughs and also sometimes very tender. Drew is marvelous and very believable and the other actors as well. Jake is also very good in this and is reminicent of his father (I assume Gary is) We both were very impressed with Luke Wilson. The scenes at the burger place was great"
