         "'The Sect' is a profoundly strange Satanic thriller. Directed by Dario Argento protege Michele Soavi (best known for the zombie movie 'Dellamorte Dellamore'), and co-scripted/co-produced by Argento himself, this shares the surreal, dreamlike feel of 'Suspiria' or 'Inferno', but without their distinctive stylish atmosphere. At times it appears to make no sense at all, especially the bizarre sequences using insects and animals, but it always holds your interest, and is certainly original and worth watching. Kelly Curtis plays the sexy but nice schoolteacher who finds herself the centre of an evil cult who have big plans for her. Horror veteran Herbert Lom ('Mark Of The Devil', 'Asylum', etc.) is a mysterious old man who she befriends after nearly accidentally running him over. Can he be trusted? Can Miriam's pet white rabbit be trusted? And what exactly do subterranean wells, a Manson-like hippie killer, evil storks, Lewis Carrollesque dream sequences, and sticking extinct earwigs up people's noses have to do with it all? I'll leave you to work it all out. A very freaky but entertaining movie that will probably become a future cult classic. Highly recommended.",
         "You can always count on an inventive and intriguing movie when it comes to anything that Argento has touched, and this Argento-scripted film is just that! The great director has left the directorial duties up to his protégé; Michele Soavi for this movie, and that is somewhat ironic because The Sect easily tops anything that Argento himself directed in the 1990's. Michele Soavi looked pretty promising up until 1994 when he released the astonishing 'Dellamorte Dellamore', and then promptly disappeared off the horror radar. It's a massive shame that the man, up until now, hasn't followed up on his four horror films; as I, and many other horror fans (I'm sure), would agree that if he'd added a few more films to his oeuvre; he could be right up there with the master himself. The plot for this film follows a young woman who almost knocks a man down while driving in her car. She then takes the man home, but due to the events that transpire; it quickly becomes obvious that she didn't take him home purely by chance... As soon as the movie opens, with America's \"Horse With No Name\", and then a character quoting lyrics from The Rolling Stones' \"Sympathy for the Devil\", you just know that you're going to be in for a great ride; and the rest of the film doesn't disappoint! Soavi succeeds in creating a fabulously foreboding atmosphere throughout the movie, and his direction isn't bad either. The locations are great; the underwater labyrinth underneath the house at the centre of the movie, which echoes Inferno, being the very best in that department! Soavi excels at direction, and this only reinforces my point about the massive shame it is that he hasn't followed up on Dellamorte Dellamore. His camera angles are superb and he really knows how to build tension and suspense! Herbert Lom is the pick of the cast, and the classic horror actor delivers an excellent hammy performance and every moment he's on screen is a delight. The film definitely does have problems, however; the fact that it's about twenty minutes overlong is one of them, and the rather silly ending is another - but on the whole, this is an excellent exhibition of horror and comes with a high recommendation from yours truly!",
         "After nearly running over an ageing man (Herbert Lom), Miriam (Kelly Curtis), feeling responsible, offers the old man a place to stay for a short while. However, this innocent invitation triggers a series of events that would change her life forever. 'The Sect' is at once an enthralling, mesmerising and stylish offering from Michele Soavi, the protégé of writer and producer, Dario Argento. Blending several styles of horror, Soavi's own unique presentation of the subject matter succeeds almost in entirety at being haunting, atmospheric and compelling. While one can see the influence of his mentor, Soavi is daring enough to put forth his own, unique brand of directorial style and flair to give 'The Sect' a distinctive appearance that sets it aside from many similar works of the era. His respect for the story and viewer is clear for all to see, never once opting for a style-over-substance approach, instead offering the stylistic elements as an accompaniment to what is already a considerably impressive film. The slow-pacing is an advantage to the film rather than a detriment and is unequivocally intentional. Soavi's methodical approach to storytelling allows him to not only develop his central character, but to gradually increase the tension in a way that does not feel forced and thus makes the climax all that more meaningful. Surrealism, unsettling visual elements and intriguing POV shots are all used to add to the atmosphere but never to become the main focal point. Above all, the keys to the grandeur of 'The Sect' are subtlety and mystery; everything else is but a bonus. To say that 'The Sect' is without flaws would unfortunately be inaccurate. However, the flaws are particularly minor in the scale of things and the negative effects of these lapses are virtually negligible. While great care has quite obviously been taken to ensure that the storyline remains rational, there are a couple of instances where illogical behaviour and actions are briefly noticeable. As mentioned, these have very little negative effect on the overall film but their use as plot devices is questionable to an extent. It is also worth pondering whether on occasion Soavi went into too much detail perpetuating the tension of certain sequences and disregarded the actual climax of the scenes? For the most part, Soavi took full advantage of the script, presenting an array of memorably shocking and surprising scenes, yet once or twice, the 'money shot' was lacking in the impact that one had come to expect and had a rather unsatisfying short-term effect. Despite these instances, it is worth considering that 'The Sect' managed to almost wholly steer clear of becoming predictable, almost as if Soavi and Argento could predict themselves how an audience would react and what they could expect. For those who doubt that modern Italian cinema is capable of producing innovative and enthralling horror, free of the paper-thin plots and unnecessarily excessive gore that has scarred so many other genre productions, 'The Sect' is the film that can prove otherwise. An occult horror/thriller full of twists and turns, shocks and surprises, surrealism, nightmarish dream sequences, symbolism, mystery and style, 'The Sect' is a film that only uses a bare minimum of special effects and instead acts almost as homage to the suspenseful horrors of yesteryear, such as 'Psycho' (1960), 'The Innocents' (1961) and 'Rosemary's Baby' (1968). Almost a pure work of art, 'The Sect' is Soavi staking a claim as possibly one of the best directors of the modern era. My rating for 'The Sect' \u0096 8/10.",
         "An evil, Devil-worshipping sect, led by their enigmatic leader Moebius Kelly(Herbert Lom)have dastardly plans for Mirian(Kelly Curtis)and it concerns unleashing evil on the world through a sordid type of birth. That's the best I can do to explain this baffling supernatural, surreal religious horror outing from director Michele Soavi whose camera is always moving, capturing the action of every scene. The way an unusual blue water flows in Miriam's house' pipes or the POV of a rabbit as it moves throughout Miriam's abode..Soavi's camera captures such action intensely. There are quite a few bizarre moments in this flick like Giovanni Lombardo Radice's stabbing of a woman, later having her heart found in his pocket in a subway as a looter tries to lift something from his coat leading to his suicide after police surround him after aborting the train. Or a bizarre sequence where Miriam's neck is picked at by a crane. Herbert Lom has the most interesting part as the sect's leader, who informs Miriam of why she was selected to carry out benevolent plans against the world and God. There's a hole in her house's basement with major significance to the plot as it works as a type of gateway. What occurs to Miriam's schoolteacher friend Kathryn(Mariangela Giordano)when her face is \"attacked\" by Moebius' facial death shroud, and Frank(Michel Adatte), Miriam's confident whose a doctor she depends on as her life is spiraling out of control,when he discovers what the sect is up to(..like Frank, we are an eyewitness to a very disturbing ceremony where a female victim's face is removed so that their leader can gain \"new life\")are also very strange occurrences within the film. Miriam soon finds herself on her own against the dangers of a sect wielding a power far greater than mankind has ever known. While, at first, I tried to make sense of it all, soon I just gave up and enjoyed Soavi's distinctive camera-work..he really doesn't take an easy way out trying every type of visually innovative trick he can think of to make each scene memorable. And, there enough wildly imaginative ideas at work to keep one from getting bored. Very dreamlike, hypnotic score from Pino Donaggio seems to mesh well with Soavi's style and the film's strange subject matter.",
         "I was quite impressed by this film! Surprised actually, by how involving it was on a problem solving level. Just by reading the box you more or less know going into the film that a young woman (Kelly Curtis, who is a dead-ringer for sister Jamie Lee at times) is going to be inducted into some kind of satanic cult, and that she will be used for some kind of blasphemous purpose to bring forth a new son of Lucifer. The fun is in watching her otherwise staid life spiral out of control after she comes in contact with a weird old man (Euro Horror legend & Captain Nemo actor Herbert Lom) who \"isn't ready to die yet\". Sure, it's ROSEMARY'S BABY all over again with production by Dario Argento, but the film is completely unpredictable the first time through in ways that were quite engaging: One endeavored to puzzle out the meanings of otherwise unrelated mundane things like blue strands in glasses of water, demonic bunnies, plumbing design, trees decorated with ornaments glittering in the sun, pelicans, fuzz falling from the sky, truck stops, rows of numbers, nasty old napkins, suicidal doctors, basements that are bigger than the houses upstairs, beds crawling with worms, giant fishhooks with finger handles, and the use of America's \"A Horse With No Name\" two years before the song was released. I mention the latter because it was the first instance of the movie stumbling, and took place about forty seconds into the proceedings. The only other time when the film stumbled was about two minutes before the end when a seemingly random event interrupted what was otherwise supposed to be someones pre-destined fate. If her fate was pre-destined, how could that have changed? The answer is that it was a plot device perhaps demanded by a producer who thought that the script was getting a bit long in the tooth. But up until then it's a riveting example of Euro Horror from the end of it's cycle: Post-Argento Italian horror. The film might be a bit too methodical in it's unraveling than fans of DEMONS or THE BEYOND might prefer, but stick with it! The movie pays off a bunch of times and once more to be clear, right up until the last few minutes is as good of a film about this subject matter as you can ask for. It also has an interesting agenda about the power of evil being beyond what any mere one of us can resist, though we can play a role in carrying out it's wishes if we so choose. The rest of the world will turn a blind eye preferring not to believe and finding other answers, starting with \"you're just imagining things\". Here is a movie that knows this is what we expect and plays with it, unveiling a mythical subversive alternate culture within our own bent upon bringing Satan back to Earth once again, and untouchable due to social considerations we ourselves take for granted. That their plans could be averted by a plot device is somewhat annoying, but if that's the trade off for 110 minutes of otherwise crackerjack horror I'm happy to pay the price. 8/10; Seek it out, you can find old videos for the price of the change between the cushions of your sofa.",
         "I first saw this film prior to its original release in the UK at the London Film Festival where Michele Soavi himself was in attendance. Afterwards I shook the man's hand and congratulated him on a fine film. The whole audience was very appreciative really. That was the last time I saw it until I finally found it again on a fine import dvd from xploitedcinema. I'm glad to say it still holds up very well indeed - the story grips from the start and doesn't let go right up to the incredible ending. Ok, so the story may have echoes of Rosemary's Baby but how often do you see a truly original horror film ? I can only think of a handful. Track this film down and you won't be disappointed.",
         "Much, much, better than The Church or Aquarius, Soavi is obviously finding his way as a director. A bit too over long and not everything makes sense - what's up with that rabbit?, but the film keeps your attention for much of it's length even though you aren't really sure what is going on. Most everything is explained in the end, and it was a nice surprise to see Herbert Lom outside of the Pink Panther films again. Overall, a more worthwhile choice for those that liked Cemetery Man than either of Soavi's previous films.",
         "A woman is chosen to bear the son of Satan by a cult headed by a mysterious old traveller. I find it pretty unfortunate to say the least that Michele Soavi last made a horror film way back in 1994. Unlike most of his Italian peers he seems to have bowed out on a high. With this film along with Stagefright, The Church and Cemetery Man, Soavi has a pretty impressive body of work. He was the premier Italian horror director from the period 1987-94. I can't say definitively why he never returned to the genre but needless to say he is a great loss. Similar to his earlier movie The Church, The Sect was also produced and co-written by Dario Argento. Soavi was something of a protégé of the great man. This one shows the influence pretty clearly once again. It has stylish direction and inventive cinematography. It also benefits from a good score from Pino Donaggio. So its overall look and feel is pretty good, while it has some well-conceived locations such as the tree and the well. Soavi really comes into his element with the dream sequence and cult ceremony scenes. The dream sequence in particular is a bravura display of cinematic technique. It's surreal, weird and very memorable. It's the highlight of the movie for sure. It has a decent enough cast that includes Herbert Lom as the mysterious old traveller, cult favourite Giovanni Lombardo Radice as the man who is chased in the underground with the human heart, while Jamie Lee-Curtis's sister Kelly leads the picture in the role of the teacher. It's by no means a faultless film; in fact it's probably the least good of Soavi's quartet of movies. It's probably a bit over long while its ending did seem very rushed and a bit unsatisfying. Nevertheless, it remains one of the very last good Italian horror films and like all Soavi films, is well worth catching.",
         "By chance, this was on TV tonight and I had been looking everywhere to find this one, so I was glad to finally see it. That being said, I feel as though my expectations were a bit too high on this one. It's not as if the film is bad, which it ain't, but I feel I was expecting another \"Suspiria\" or \"Inferno\" which, a few similarities aside, are quite different from this one. Still, there are some truly powerful images that sticked in my head after watching it and the first dream sequence was just brilliant. The acting was pretty good also, with Kelly Curtis coming off as a likable protagonist alongside the great Hebert Lom giving an eerie performance as one of the villains. There's also a fine script that, though owes a lot to \"Rosemary's Baby\", came out as fresh and quite unique really, and not the carbon copy one might expect. The cinematography is also spellbinding, and as in his previous (and in my opinion slightly superior) \"The Church\", Michele Soavi proves to be a visual artist on the same level as Dario Argento. The film's flaws come mostly from the strong made-for-TV feel and a rather cheesy score from Pinno Donagio, as well as some rather unintentionally funny moments here and there (easily overcomed by the claustrophobic, nightmarish atmosphere). Overall, a quite decent obscure chiller that deserves more attention than it gets. I only wish I could like it more myself, as it's one of the last great Italian horror movies of the past twenty years or so. Hopefully, repeated viewings will make me appreciate it more, because it surely got potential. 7/10",
         "As a director, Dario Argento may very well be a master of the horror genre. But as a screenwriter, he has already proved that, more often than not, he doesn't have a clue. The script he has co-written for \"The Sect\" is so awful that I am inclined to believe there wasn't any script to begin with - they were probably making it up as they went along. The movie is simply a series of disconnected scenes that were thrown together in the vain hope that they would form some sort of \"plot\". The result is a torturous piece of schlock that bored me to tears. This one should get 0 out of 4 stars, but I'll change it to 0.5 for the cool \"face ripping\" scene, and for the fun of seeing an aging Giovani Lombardo Radice in a minor role, ten years after \"Cannibal Ferox\". Still, it apparently has its fans so you may want to check it out for yourself....",
         "Soavi has succeeded in making bizarre films in his career and my favourite above them all is Dellamorte Dellamore (aka The Cemetery Man). So the expectations were quite high for this movie. It is understandable that Soavi was finding himself as a director and with Dario Argento the film may end up being interesting at least and incoherent at most. The script was written by Argento with a couple of others and we all know that most Argento's films have quite a weak script and this time it's not different. People who know Argento's films can see his impact on this film and some fans may even like this but for anyone else there isn't much to see. The film would have been so much better with higher quality soundtrack, so if there had been someone like Morricone himself making a few scores for the film it'd have raised the film to a higher level. Secondly the film should be cut to 90 minutes, so easily about 30 minutes could be cut out without losing anything significant. The film doesn't engage as much as it should and i was just waiting for it to end after the first hour. Acting isn't too good either. I wasn't expecting to see a masterpiece and i can watch and even respect a bad movie. But this is just a bland \"americanized\" horror flick which lacks a sense of style that many Italian horror films used to posses. In overall many fans may like the film but for anyone else it's just a waste of time.",
         "Even more bizarre than Michele Soavi's other films, including \"Dellamorte Dellamore\" and \"the Church\". It barely contains a resemblance of a plot, but it's definitely entertaining. Some scenes are very creepy, others are downright laughable. Example: One scene has a woman getting her face torn off by Satanists, another has a rabbit watching television and using the remote control. Why??? Oh well, it doesn't matter, I still love this movie. Not as good as \"Dellamorte Dellamore\" but far superior to \"The Church\", and probably \"Stage Fright\". Check it out if you're in the mood for something really weird.",
         "\"The Sect,\" also released as \"The Devil's Daughter\" in the U.S., follows an American schoolteacher in Frankfurt who crosses paths with a mysterious elderly man. Little does she know, he is not as innocent as he seems, and their chance encounter sets in motion the plot of a group of Satanic ritual killers who plan to use her for a very important occasion. Comparisons of this film have been made over and over again to \"Rosemary's Baby,\" though I think that's a bit unfair to both films; it's no doubt an influence, but \"The Sect\" is far weirder and considerably less well-plotted (and the truth of the matter is that only the last ten minutes even remotely resemble Polanski's epic). Directed by Argento protege Michele Soavi, \"The Sect\" is as entertaining as it is absurd. The plot is shoddily strung-together, borrowing heavily instead from Argento's \"Three Mothers\" trilogy. Incoherence comes with the territory of Italian horror by and large, and \"The Sect\" is no different; plotholes abound and the real motives and nuances of the Satanic cult remain incredibly vague, which is a major pitfall. That said, in all of its unintentional ambiguity, the film is hinged on several key moments that are quite memorable and well-executed, one of which involves a completely demented operating room sequence. The demonic angle underpins all of this, but is again underdeveloped, and the finale is clunky as it doesn't really manage to bring the audience to any sense of resolution or awareness of what they've just witnessed. Kelly Curtis (first daughter of Janet Leigh, sister of Jamie Lee) is hit-and-miss here, though the overdubbing makes it difficult to really gauge her performance. Herbert Lom makes an appearance as the elderly henchman who sets the entire plot into motion and is a welcome presence. All in all, \"The Sect\" is an entertaining mess of ideas. It has all the cornerstones of a good Satanic horror flick: A mysterious cult, inexplicable supernatural phenomena, possession, conspiracy, and ancient beetles-but there is not really a thread running through any of these things to make for a sturdy film. That aside, I do find it incredibly entertaining in all its weirdness, and there are a few hallucinogenic sequences that are well-executed. Standout moment: The sequence in which Curtis's posessed colleague propositions for sex at a truck stop, and everything that follows. 6/10.",
         "Nothing like a bad Italian combination of \"Rosemary's Baby\" plus \"The Wrath of Khan\" to make for a low intensity boring film. The beginning of the film opens with evil satanic bikers killing i.e sacrificing some desert hippies. It then jumps to 1991 Frankfort where a Van Helsing looking guy (Herbert Lom) sticks a bug up a school teacher's (Kelly Curtis) nose. Very long. Very boring. Not well acted. There are better ways to spend your time and money. Released under the title \"La setta.\" PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, sex, nudity.",
         "Michele Soavi's The Sect concerns that network of Satan as they prepare the way for the Antichrist. From a commune being slaughtered in the early 1970's - a scene with references to the Rolling Stones that repeat throughout the film - to multiple modern murders that follow, including a heart being left on a train and a suicide in public, the devil's helpers are organized, know how to plan and are well ahead of the rest of society. In modern Germany, schoolteacher Miriam Kreisl (Kelly Curtis, sister of Jamie Leigh) saves Moebius Kelly (Herbert Lom, Hammer's The Phantom of the Opera) after an accident and brings him back to her house. Within a few hours, he's injecting her and shoving beetles up her nose while she sleeps and giving her nightmares of a giant bird having sex with her. From there, the film descends into more of a series of nightmares than a fixed narrative. That makes sense once you realize that its origins in three different scripts that producer Dario Argento, director Michele Soavi and writer Gianni Romoli couldn't finish. So you're left with a film with a giant glowing blue gateway to Hell in the basement, a plot to conceive the Antichrist much like Rosemary's Baby, an evil Shroud of Turin that can kill and bring people back from the dead and, oh yeah, a super smart rabbit named Rabbit who can use a TV remote. The Sect has some references to other films, with the first victim being named Marion Crane (Psycho) and another named Martin Romero (obviously, George Romero and his Braddock vampire film Martin). Following Soavi's Stage Fright and The Church, this film offers less of the pure insanity that he'd bring to bear in his next film (and sadly, final horror film) Cemetery Man. Yet a restrained Soavi is still more visually inventive than a hundred lesser directors. From images of animal-masked children to the evil Jesus that smokes up and annihilates hippies in the flashback, there's a continual undercurrent of menace and doom. Strange symbols just appear. People disappear even after we see them arrive. Or they die in airplane accidents and still appear. Kathryn (Mariangela Giordano, Evelyn from Burial Ground, she of the incestual zombie child relationship) shows up to get smothered by the previously mentioned evil shroud. Faces get ripped clean off. Worms show up in the water. A possessed Kathryn convinces a trucker to kill her. Rabbit symbolism abounds. Kathryn gets back up off the operating table and attacks Miriam before killing herself again, which a doctor tries to explain as a commonplace thing. Long black tunnels lead to a sinister mortuary. The doctor who couldn't save Kathryn and Damon, the Jesus-like killer from the opening, are working together. A woman's face is ripped clean off, Hellraiser-style. Even trusted detective Frank is taken over and wants to kill Kathryn now that he knows her secret. Whew. I hope these short bursts of words give you an idea of just how much happens in this movie. It never really lets up, becoming more and more unreal. Moebius comes back to life to tell Miriam that every moment of her life has been planned, that they own her, that everything has been for this moment indescribable joy. The cult gathers as the doctor injects her, sending her to sleep. Finally, the devil comes to take Miriam. In shadow form, he appears to be human, but what attacks her is a giant bird that pecks at her neck and has his way with her. The cult lowers her into a pit as Moebius raves, screaming that he is her father and that she will give birth to the Antichrist. As she waits in the blue basement water, midwives swim around her, facilitating the birth as the moon slowly goes dark. A giant amniotic sac with a child inside is lifted as the moon goes completely black. In a shot straight out of Rosemary's Baby, Miriam moves through the crowd to see what Moebius refers to as their \"revenge against God.\" He offers her the chance to raise the child. Cut to her kneeling, beatific in white, as she stares into the blue waters of the well below. The doctor attempts to be tender to her, but Miriam tosses her down the pit. She makes her way to the rest of the cult and accepts her child, running with it as a motorcyclist chases her and crashes, creating a giant wall of fire. Moebius screams that they are ger family now. Miriam kneels into the flames of the crashed motorcycle and sacrifices herself to destroy the baby and Moebius. Fire crews put out the bodies as we see their charred remains wash away - except Miriam is still alive under all of the ash. An eagle circles the sky as Miriam believes that her son saved her. The Sect is crazy, but it still doesn't feel as strange as The Church or Stage Fright. Yet again, when compared to any other film, it's odd as hell. It flies by, a mix of imagery and ideas that takes you on a whirling dervish of a ride. It's hard to find - Shameless put out a UK only DVD this year - but there are plenty of not so legal ways to find a copy. I'd recommend that you do so.",
         "Another submission into the Lovecraftian film genre. So, being an HPL fan, I rushed to ebay and found a copy. This film, though low budget maintained a dark, sinister, atmosphere and does, indeed belong on the Lovecraftian list. Not only Lovecraft fans will like it, but so will possession movie fan, and it hold up with the likes of Rosemary's Baby, Beyond the Door, and the Manitou as a classic diabolic thriller. It reminded me of Fulchi films, but without the nonstop gore (and was still good anyway, ha ha ha). Hey, what more can you ask for? get two fixes with one flick! If you're a fan, check it out.",
         "Soavi's third film credited as a director simply is a unique experience. It's a complex and demanding horror adventure, handling about a young German schoolteacher (Kelly Curtis) who becomes dangerously involved with a satanic sect led by veteran-actor Herbert Lom. The screenplay (co-written by Dario Argento) often is confusing, but the energy and enthusiasm Soavi puts into the direction simply make this one of the greatest Italian genre efforts ever. The Sect has a terrifically sinister premise and it's brilliantly cinematographed. Soavi clearly has eye for camera-movements and original angles. Even though this film features a rarely seen level of morbidity, you can't just categorize it as horror alone! In a way, The Sect also is a twisted fairy-tale (try and detect all the similarities between Miriam's adventure and 'Alice in Wonderland') and a ultra-black comedy (the sect's most devoted killer looks exactly like Charles Manson!). I'd love to write more about this intriguing film but I'm reluctant to reveal too many spoilers. At any moment in this film, you have no idea what'll happen next. Anything is possible in Michele Soavi land and I'd love for you to check it out yourself! There are a few deliciously grim sequences and great make-up effects. Highlight of the macabre unquestionably is the face-ripping scene! And there's another great trivia detail for Italian horror buffs: Giovanni Lombardo Radice has a small role early in the film. The man is clearly aging but he still knows how to gruesomely die in films. Let's talk about Michele Soavi!! Unquestionably Dario Argento's most gifted acolyte, but he never really got out of Argento's or Lamberto Bava's shadow. Dario Argento (Tenebrae, Inferno, Suspiria\u0085) took Soavi under his wings because they have the same tastes in film-making and they both share a passion for horror. Very true, but I think you can't deny Soavi is a lot more subtle than his mentor and merely chooses for suspense and atmosphere rather than to rely on graphic gore. The film I saw of him (The Sect, Dellamorte Dellamore and The Church) all had a fair share of blood but they're not exactly the gorehound festivals Argento often delivers. I also think Soavi puts more dept and intelligence in his films. Everything he ever was involved in comes with my highest possible recommendation\u0085",
         "Well this is not and usual terror film like other Hollywood movies. M. Soavi, director of another excellent movies like Dellamorte Dellamore or La Chiesa, takes you to a strange world where the evil surrounds Miriam, a lonely girl who is the victim of a sect, she is the person who must brings the devil to the earth. Visually, the film is incredible, genial camera angles, excellent colours and sounds management that makes you enter the story. There is also a reference to La Chiesa, the hole at Miriam's house, is the door to the evil, like the hole at the church of La Chiesa. Strongly recommended in order to see a different terror from Hollywood",
         "Unusual film has a woman being pursued by witches and she has a hole in her basement that leads to another world where the witches are at. Kind of reminded me of Alice in Wonderland in a few parts. And a few parts are also downright creepy. Thsi is one you may have to watch twice but it is very good.",
         "(Credit IMDb) A spree of grisly murders is perpetrated in Frankfurt by a group of Satan worshippers. A school teacher almost runs over an old man with a box and takes him in. It's no accident that the old man has come into her life, and it quickly becomes apparent that he has plans for her, plans that involve a permanent future with the Satanic cult. I like Michelle Sovai. He's a prodigy of Dario Argento (One of my favorite horror directors of all time) It is surrealistic, weird, but it doesn't maintain your interest what so ever. it was so boring, I had to do other things at the same time. Maybe it's because I didn't care for Rosemary's Baby, but I wasn't fond of the plot either. It just doesn't have anything that stands out about it, aside from Sovai's stylish direction. Kelly Curtis is Jamie Lee Curtis's sister. DUD",
         "This is basically another take on the Rosemary's Baby scenario, but done in that inimitably weird Italian style. By this point Michele Soavi is beginning to find his own voice, and we can see him drifting apart from his controlling mentor/producer, Dario Argento. Things get off to a bad start with a ludicrous prologue in which some Satanic bikers slaughter a bunch of hippies. So far so good, except for the gang leader's ridiculous tendency to quote The Rolling Stones, talking about how their music is full of profound knowledge understood only by the chosen few. It's completely stupid, but it was a necessary sacrifice; Soavi and his co-writer (Gianni Romoli) allowed Argento to write the opening scene himself to ensure that he'd leave the rest of the movie alone. This is hilariously acknowledged in the movie itself, when at one point the head of the titular sect (a creepily subdued performance by Herbert Lom) picks up a music magazine in the protagonist's apartment and, with the air of a man who now knows better, reminisces about how deep the Stones' music was considered in the seventies. Anyway, like Soavi's other films this is brimming with nightmarish imagery (I love the burial shroud that flits in and out of the narrative) and mysterious symbolism, but it hasn't aged quite as well. The cinematography of Raffaele Mertes is serviceable during the film's moodier sections, but most of the time it feels a bit flat. The same can be said of Pino Donaggio's soundtrack, whose unimaginative synthesizer beats and drones were unfortunately endemic in the nineties. Since this is a Soavi film, though, it's still well above average and certainly never boring - he takes a derivative story and spices it up with bizarre images, stylized scenes of violence, a large helping of symbolism (much of it related to fertility), and even a pinch of Lovecraft. The ending is a point of contention for some, but I think it's both gutsy and surprisingly moving. This is perhaps Soavi's least successful horror film, but here we can already see him experimenting with images and ideas that will be perfected in his next project, Dellamorte Dellamore."
