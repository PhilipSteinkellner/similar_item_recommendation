         "Film Review: \"I Love You Both\" is the reason to go to film festivals. It is the quintessential experience of seeing new talent communicate with fresh voices and visuals that fill each frame with quiet grace. \"I Love You Both\" is produced, directed, and stars Doug Archibald in his first feature length film. Mr. Archibald co-wrote the film with his sister and co-star Kristin Archibald, and they demonstrate an ear for dialogue that made every line crackle with wit, humor, absurdity, honesty, and life. This is one of those films where you can close your eyes and simply listen to the actors speak and be completely sated. However, I wouldn't keep them closed for long, because the visuals are equally impressive. Each shot is carefully and meticulously framed, focused, and lit. Every pattern of wallpaper, wardrobe selection, and location is lovingly selected by Mr. Archibald and production designers Jay Kyung Eum and Jagyoung Eum, and set decorator and art department Jessica Miano Kruel and Jessica Kruel (who may be the same person). The film uses the provocative plot of fraternal twins Don and Krystal, played by Mr. and Ms. Archibald respectively, who begin to date the same man, Andy, portrayed by Lucas Neff (\"Raising Hope\"). However, this is merely a vehicle to explore the relationship of Donny and Krystal and their bond. We see their love, kindness, loyalty, and truth as they grapple with their yearning to care for someone other than each other. And as the world disappoints them time and time again, they have each other. One of the most satisfying aspects of the film is that we just don't see Don and Krystal stuck in a co-dependent brother and sister relationship and spinning in place, but we see each struggle and evolve as they face their individual challenges. So many scripts get this wrong. How many times must I watch characters start and end the film as the same person. How many times must I watch characters experience contrived epiphanies created out of nothing. Each character must emotionally begin the story one place and finish in another, even if their physical bodies only move a few yards from where they began. Finally, I should note the sound department for helping Mr. Archibald hit the right note with every beat, song, and sound effect (there was only one scene when bird chirping pulled me out of the scene in the hotel room after he finishes tying the bow-tie\u2014 perhaps that can be fixed?). I'm not sure I will see a better film at the Napa Valley Film Festival. This is a gem that should be picked up at more film festivals. If I was still writing script coverage for a studio, I would highly recommend this film be picked up for US and international distribution for limited release in art houses, and definitely for streaming in the US, Canada, and Europe. It was my absolute delight to see this film.",
         "I appreciate the artistic perspestive in this film, and its fresh storyline, but I have to say this movie left me feeling confused and frustrated that I spent that much time investing in the storyline for little payoff. It's unrealistic that the characters wouldn't follow up with the 'dramatic' ending of their relationship with Andy, and that Andy wasn't even really a character much at all. We know nothing about any of these people the ENTIRE movie. The main characters are expressionless and very hard to watch on screen because of the lack on intrigue and character. Donny has ZERO personality...It makes the viewer really frustrated to not know any backstory to a character. Andy was just a quirky guy, no substance, no background... no follow up. I'm sorry but I'd suggest not watching this movie.",
         "The two main characters were not likable and it was difficult to sympathise with them. The direction was very amateur. Oddly jarring cut scenes, dialogue that seemed unnatural, unbelievable or over-the-top performances played for comedy but falling flat. I think Andy played a believable love interest however there was never any resolution to his story. There are many good films about love triangles; this is not one of them.",
         "If you are seeking a Jerry Springer-type relationship film with drunken fist fights, or a film where everything is neatly tied up, HEA, and you don't have to think at all and have everything spoon fed to you in goobs of cliches, look elsewhere. If you want to watch a sweet, charming, original film that proves blood is thicker than water, this is it. A wonderfully funny film about twin interdependence and the issues related to it. All three lead characters are delightful and interesting. The ending is sublime.",
         "Where to begin. The characters were for the most part hard to look at, as if they searched out unattractive actors. On top of that the main character was hard to understand as she spoke so fast. I don't know why I kept watching it but I did until the end and it never got better. So many glitches in the plot and direction I cannot recall them all.",
         "lame movie. legit had to skip through it sucks because the characters were likable and it had promise. it just dragged on a lot and really there was nothing redeeming about it at all in the end. just don't watch it, save your time, you're gonna think its gonna be good because its indie and cutsie and reminds you of movies that are much, much better. don't do it."
