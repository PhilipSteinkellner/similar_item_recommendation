He made his first film at the age of thirteen and continued to make them until his death in 1989. La Seine a rencontré Paris is a film without actors, it's a film with men, women and children who love Seine. We travel across the Seine on a boat and are given the chance to observe and see things we usually wouldn't notice. After the quiet countrysides we arrive in Paris where life goes on quietly at the river. We see the everyday routines of the people - we see the simplicity in life, which turns into poetry; a man repairing his shoe and lovers not caring about the outside world. Then comes the storm, which disturbs the peace of Paris. After the storm people go back to their daily routines and at the same we leave Paris by traveling back on Seine. The film won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival in 1958, the same award that has been given to the famous documentarian Georges Franju. La Seine a rencontré Paris is an interesting portrayal of the Parisian society in the 50's. It's a poetic film about love and life. The film is based on a poem by Jacques Prevert, who also reads the commentary track."],
