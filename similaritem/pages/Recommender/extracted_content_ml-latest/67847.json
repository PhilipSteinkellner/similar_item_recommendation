         "An excellent comedy full of black humor, mad props to the writer, director and actors. Funny, good writing, innovative, and definitely watchable. A group of three friends live together; one dies because of his illegal embalming business. The two other friends lose the body and chase it across the country trying to recover it. The body keeps changing hands, and everyone who gets it tries to find a way to get rid of it without involving the police. A good premise to begin with, and it just gets better as the movie goes along. This was the first Polish movie I'd seen and I was highly impressed with the production values and high quality overall.",
         "Black comedy placed in polish reality. An ordinary thief named Goldi, who works for minor gangster and smuggler alongside with his sidekick - Dizel, while escaping with stolen goods by train, meets in a compartment Wolter, a very good dressed man who looks like a busienessman and who also happen to be dead. In the very same train we also meet a decent looking grandie with her grand-daughter who turn out to be a deadly assasins in pursuit after another passanger of the train. This is how it all begins. Further in the movie we meet another people, who's fates are bound with each other in a very wicked and funny situations. This movie can't be boring, cause you never know what will happen next. It also won't let you to sit still in your chair, because you will be rolling on the floor laughing while watching what happens on the screen. I really recomend this movie to anyone who's looking for some good fun."
