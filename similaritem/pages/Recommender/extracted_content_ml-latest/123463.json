         "This movie has been a favorite of mine ever since I first saw it when I was seven years old. It was released in the summer of 1986 and I still remember being at a local video store with one of my brothers and noticing a movie poster for it displayed in one of the windows. When I realized that Anthony Michael Hall was the star of the show, I was astounded because everything else I had seen him in before Out Of Bounds was a comedy. Even though I was not permitted to watch anything R rated as far as my folks were concerned, my brother agreed to rent the movie for me so that we could watch it together while our parents weren't home. I watched it with him and loved every minute of it. Anthony Michael Hall's name in the movie was Daryl Cage and he was the heroic main character. The whole time I was hoping that he was going to conquer the bad guy as my pulse was pounding during the thrillingly intense scenes and I was relieved and happy when he did in the end. I must admit however, Anthony Michael Hall didn't do a very good job of acting in some parts of this movie but he was enjoyable to watch. Jenny Wright who played the part of Dizz was beautiful with her punk rocker hair style and sexy natural curves. Jeff Kober played Roy Gaddis who of course was the bad guy that killed Daryl's brother and sister in law. Jeff sure is a handsome guy and he did a fantastic job portraying the role of the scuzzy psychotic drug dealer. Another thing I love about the movie is the brief appearance by Siouxsie And The Banshees performing \"Cities In Dust\" in the Dirtbox Bar. All together this movie is exhilaratingly entertaining and one of the best ones I've ever seen. Out Of Bounds rocks!!!",
         "It's so screamingly bad, that it's fun to watch. I.E.,in a chase scene when being pursued by the local police, he jumps onto a motorcycle in an alley occupied by a much larger man than he and says \"Get the Hell outta here!\" Now there's a detailed directive. In so little as not even questioning the authority of this 'beanpole' who popped onto the back of his bike, as to what's going on? He complies with the demand and takes off like a scalded monkey! I'm just sad that other more worthy projects don't get made, don't get funded, due to the fact that the money is being spent on moronic-movies...like this little gem. The directing was so poor and facetious it's obvious that this was only made for a bunch of 'braces baring' teen and pre teen giggly girls and teen-Beat heart throb 'Hall'. This is his vehicle. This is not about being a truly well made story. When I looked up the director of this movie, a Mr. Tuggle, I was thankful that he has not been put to 'Work' on more films. He has only directed one other movie that I could find. That one actually worked out a little better, TIGHTROPE - Starring: Clint Eastwood. Since Eastwood always seems to bring back a great performance, between the two, 'Tightrope' is the only choice here there or well, anywhere.",
         "I always liked this film because it showed that Hall was not just some goofy nerd all the time. In this film he is faced by drug dealers and murderers and more real to life situations than that of other movies, such as the \"Pretty in Pink\" genre 80's movie. I don't see that it ever got released on DVD like some others from that time, why is that? Hall proves himself in a dramatic, thoughtful role as a simple teen who is able to develop survivor instincts under pressure. I have seen it many times and like it much more than the \"Breakfast Club\" or even \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" where the comedy pales after a few times of watching. I do not think it got the press it deserved. Many of my friends have never seen it. The film barely gets a mention anywhere, I think because it is not a comedy and is R-Rated for showing violence. I think people needed to see Hall do more dramatic acting than just stuck doing continual comedic roles. I think this movie shows part of the man who became one to play in the \"Dead Zone.\"",
         "Anthony Michael Hall is way Out of Bounds on a trip to Los Angeles. Fresh off the farm from Iowa, he picks up Jeff Kober's travel bag by mistake. Kober gets Hall's change of wardrobe and Hall gets over a million dollars in heroin. I don't think Jeff Kober has ever played a good guy in any of the films or television shows I've ever seen him in. He's succeeded Lyle Bettger in playing a lovely variety psychotics and in this case he's one psychotic drug dealer looking for his stash. Kober murders Hall's brother and his wife who Hall was staying with when he learns where he's staying and to top it all off, LAPD detective Glynn Turman is thinking Hall did the deed. Some trigger happy cops nearly kill Hall and he's off and running looking for the only other person he knows in Los Angeles, a waitress played by Jenny Wright who he met on the plane out from Iowa. Farm boy Hall is in one hostile environment as he tries desperately to survive and clear himself. Anthony Michael Hall was still in his brat pack period when he did Out of Bounds. He portrays the resourceful, but vulnerable Iowa kid very well. But the acting honors of this film go to Jeff Kober. A really unsung and underrated performer, Kober always delivers the goods when he's a bad guy. In fact one day I'd like to see try doing comedy for a change. Till then Kober will keep you on the edge of your seat when you watch him in Out of Bounds.",
         "Daryl Cage (Anthony Michael Hall), is an Iowa farm boy who chooses to leave home and live in Los Angeles with his brother. At the airport in Los Angeles, Daryl's duffel bag is accidentally switched with one containing a drug dealer's heroin. Consequently, Daryl's brother and his girlfriend are murdered, but the police mistakenly suspect Daryl of the crime. He becomes the prime suspect of his brother's murder and must clear his own name. He reaches out to the only person he knows in L.A., Dizz (Jenny Wright), who he met earlier on the plane. With Dizz's help he must also rid himself of the heroin by tracking down the dealer and finding his brother's killer. This movie is really hard to find. I don't think it was ever released on DVD. I recently caught it on the Sony Movie Channel and had to save it on my DVR. I hadn't seen it in so long and it really brought me back. There is some great scenery of 80's Los Angeles. This movie made me fall in love with Jenny Wright and Jeff Kober is a great villain as usual. Lookout for an appearances by Stiles from Teen Wolf and Siouxsie and the Banshees!!!",
         "I admit, there are parts of this movie which are incredibly dumb. A lot of it owes, the incredibly poor script. But I really liked the fast paced flow of the movie. And we have a new action hero, Anthony Michael Hall. Yeah, right? Yeah too f..in' right. He rocks in the movie, that's a perfect vehicle for him, after the string of John Hughes films prior. He plays a farm boy, Daryl, in Iowa, and we see his miserable self, out there on the tractor working the farm. Some youngies speeding along in a red convertible, yell something to him, from a far, though I couldn't make out what it was, but I'm pretty sure they were dissing him. His parents have been arguing over Daryl's future, and we get a taste of their fracas's. At the advice of his Mother, he's sent out to L.A. to live with his brother. After having some wet dreams on the plane, he meets a would be actress, Dizz, sitting next to him. He makes one fatal mistake that costs him his older brother and fiancée's life, only the start of a bigger body count in the film, though we can't forget the poor sod at the start, who also made the fatal mistake of being a savior to the wrong guy, a drug trafficker, and psychopathic Kober, a great character actor of evil. Daryl had picked up the wrong duffel bag, an identical one to his-what are the chances? This bag worth killing for, contains H. Now, you're asking yourself, how did Kober not find Daryl at his brothers. He was in a segregated outhouse concealed coolly by a hedge. Now Daryl's on the run, with the H, and it isn't long before he's up to his neck in trouble. But this is the thrill ride, Hall, hijacking a bikie was great stuff, while nearly being blown away by a cop, while making a righteous phone call. He's soon reunited with Dizz, his only chance, of clearing himself, and taking pr..k Kober down. We really get to see a bit of L.A's underworld, Dizz and Daryl, putting it out there, he has what Kober's after, and soon enough they're being pursued by this psycho, where in the mean time, more bodies show up + a dead mouse, crushed by Kober's merciless hand. I though the way Kober died was stupid though, with Daryl, just happening to be a champion knife thrower. OOB has some pumping rock scores too, but I liked the energy of the film, regardless of the stupidity or realism, but the latter is not really why we go to the movies, now is it.",
         "A pretty silly film, \"Out of Bounds\" begins as a teeny-bopper style of movie that would suit John Hughes' tastes, and ends like how a Charles Bronson vigilante film would be. Anthony Michael Hall plays Darryl Cage, an Iowa teen who travels to L.A. to visit his brother, only to have his duffel bag accidentally switched with a bag belonging to a dope runner. What follows is a frantic yet unbelievable streets of the city of angels. Hall is a likeable actor (in my book, he's a lot cooler than Leo DiCaprio!), but I wasn't used to seeing him in a gritty action film like this. He's too much of a pretty boy to look ind",
         "Out of Bounds might have the potential for a mild, but good 80s teen thriller. Unfortunately, the predictable story and the cast screwed the chances for that. If you have seen the 1991 Patrick Dempsey movie, Run, then you already have some idea of the plot behind Out of Bounds. Both are quite similar as those run for your life type movies, but Run is a much better choice if this be what suits your mood. Anthony Michael Hall is Daryl Cage, a quiet kid from farm country, Iowa, who goes to stay with his older brother in Los Angeles. It all begins with identical bags at an airport luggage pickup where Daryl picks up a bag that (oh my god) looks just like his, only it contains a large supply of drugs. But the rightful owners mistakenly suspect Daryl for someone who is unexpectedly meddling in their business, so they to eliminate him. Long story short, as this mistake sadly leads to the death of his brother, Daryl is on the run not only from gangsters, but also from cops who think he's the murderer. Daryl befriends a witty, stylish young woman (Jenny Wright) who is his only chance at saving himself because obviously, he proves too stupid to help himself. This could've been a decent movie, but right from the beginning, the movie is just far too predictable for any of the sudden suspense moments to work on the audience. And second, Anthony Michael Hall either behaves like he was too good to be in this movie, or his character Daryl is supposed to be so apathetic, that it's hard to believe someone would react this way given the situation he's in. The only good thing about this movie is the likable Jenny Wright who reminded me of Emily Lloyd's performance in Cookie. And the music is alright too, as Stuart Copeland's 80s compositions typically were. But, I found that the bad qualities (the story and the leading man) seemed to outweigh even that. Therefore, I recommend watching 'Run' instead. The story is kind of similar--a young student (Patrick Dempsey) who was at the wrong place at the wrong time suddenly becomes the target of both the mafia and their team of corrupt cops thanks to one very big misunderstanding. Likewise, a young woman (Kelly Preston) is their at his aid. Run has better action, a better story, and hell if it's 80s teen stars you're looking for, why not settle for Dempsey?",
         "\"Out Of Bounds\" is an action packed thriller with teenage actors such as Anthony Michael Hall (Breakfast Club) , and Jenny Wright (Young Guns 2). With Jeff Kober as the main villain named Roy Gaddis who is the sadistic and crazy drug dealer , and Raymond J. Barry as a crooked drug enforcement agent. The film is about a farmboy Daryl Cage (Michael Hall) who is encouraged to leave his parents farm and move to Los Angeles with his brother. But something does go wrong , very wrong , when his brother mistakenly mixes up Daryls luggage and picks up a bag of drugs. Just hours after he arrives at his brothers place , his brother (played by the unknown Kevin McCorkle) is brutally slaughtered by the owner of the drugs. Of course the cops cannot find any fingerprints in the house except for daryl's, so he is blamed for the murder. So with the cops and a pyschotic drug dealer on his tail , Daryl and his friend Dizz must seek safety , seek revenge for his brother , and prove that Daryl is innocent. good plot , great filming , and your average budget is backed up by the supporting cast including Ji Tu Cumbuka as the dealers partner , and Meat Loaf who appears as a friend of the dealer and the pilot , Gil. All of these things add up to a minor success at the box office , and a good style of 80's teenage star films , and being shown on television quite a bit.",
         "Here's something almost enjoyable with many 1980's elements we all love to see on the screen but it just doesn't hold up all that well for too long, becoming very confusing and tiring to finally get to one conclusion: poor film. With clichés being thrown at its audience in several directions, \"Out of Bounds\" is about a country boy (Anthony Michael Hall) who is sent to California to visit his older brother when a mix with the bags has him chased by the police and by dangerous drug dealers (parts of Jeff Kober and Raymond J. Barry) who are looking for the content in their bag (lots of drugs). His only help comes from a girl (Jenny Wright) he met on the plane and who'll try to find a way out of this situation. The script isn't so terrible but it's deeply problematic. But everything's so unbelievable! All of sudden this well-mannered, almost shy kid with just a change of clothes can manage to be a hot shot who deals with the cool kids in town, or fire weapons at bad guys. There wasn't much time to dwell on his background but the very few given offers so little that you wonder where did he learn to survive in this concrete jungle armed to the teeth. It's a successful succession of blunders one after another in this story (the worse being when the drug dealer notices that the bags were changed. He's hold on a line, looks to someone carrying a similar bag and goes chasing the guy (which is the hero). Ridiculous moment. It entertains a little, offers some fine action sequences and invests a little in dramatic efforts. The few merits of this goes to Anthony Michael Hall making a good pair with Jenny Wright, they were a good team escaping from the excesses common to flicks like this with those love/hate relationships, it's nothing like that in here. Best in the show was the detective played by Glynn Turman, very good acting. The guys playing the villains are trapped in the common place category: do the bad guy face, kill some people and that's it. Meat Loaf was reduced to two scenes and I couldn't understand why he was there anyway. Stewart Copeland found some good themes for the movie's score; there's a good-looking use of The Smiths in one funny scene after Hall's transformation of character; and there's a fun cameo from Siouxsie and the Banshees. And an award should be given to the sound mixers and editors from this piece. The sound sucked terribly, worst sound mixing ever! The soundtrack and some of the dialogs are too in the foreground, highlighted but all the rest goes unheard, you can't hear the footsteps when the characters are running or walking. Lame. It goes so fast at parts, so messy that the most awaited moment is for its ending to come because by that time it already became something you don't follow anymore. If nostalgia hits you well, go pick another movie from that glorious decade. This doesn't worth much of a curiosity really. 4/10",
         "I don't know if Anthony Michael Hall was trying to be a minimalist in this one, given the character's farm background, or if he just acted poorly. He mumbles and never changes his facial expression. Also, he never breaks down and faces the intense reality of what happened to his brother. But perhaps adrenalin kicks in when you're on the run, and there's no time to sit and contemplate. *The huge plot hole is the fact that he struggles with a repair man right after discovering his brother's dead body, and he accidentally shoots the repair guy. You never hear a word about that again. No guilt, no mention from the cops, no nothing. Having said all this, I loved the movie. It shows you how your life can change dramatically overnight. The scenes of 80s synth bands in Hollywood nightclubs are priceless, and Jenny Wright was like a non-singing Cyndi Lauper, who was a famous singer at the same time. Wright was natural and considerably entertaining. Also, the bad guy was chilling and believable. Jeff Kober portrayed a sadist and sociopath. There ARE such characters. He looks like a big dude in this, but in reality, he's average size, according to his bio. If you like 80s pop culture and crime/action pictures set in the streets of L.A., you should enjoy this one. Don't forget to check out No Man's Land too. It's better and stars Charlie Sheen.",
         "I didn't think I would like this movie and I actually only watched it because I am a huge Anthony Michael Hall fan but it did end up surprising me with how into it I became. The plot line is very generic.. or would be since a lot more movies have been made like it since then but the acting and directing of the movie is very good and still pulls you into it. Anthony Michael Halls acting is once again flawless and natural, it just shows how great his range of abilities is as an actor. The female lead annoyed me a bit but that's just my opinion.. i found her voice annoying. Overall a great movie with great acting. 7/10 just because I didn't like the gore in it, it's very minimum but if your queasy be guarded.",
         "Predictable '80s actioner. Everything is set up as if it's underlined. We see Anthony Michael Hall practicing with his knife, so we know it'll come into play. Jeff Kober is good as the guy pursuing Hall. HIS motivations and actions are the only ones that make any sense, and he's the bad guy! Somebody gave me the video as a birthday present because I'm a huge Kober fan. If you are too, go watch AUTOMATIC (1994) or your box set of KINDRED instead.",
         "I've read three reviews of this movie: two knock the plot, and one knocks the acting. Why? I've seen worse movies (with bigger budgets) that the critics loved. At least the \"kid\" isn't depicted as being more brilliant than the cops or drug dealer. Yeah, there are some plot gaffes ... like, all the kid has to do is show that his bag check ticket doesn't match the one on the bag to prove it isn't his. But, hey! This is all make believe, anyway. So why not believe this kid is so scared he doesn't know what to do? It really is an okay movie. Fine for an afternoon diversion. If you like this genre, I doubt you'll be disappointed."
