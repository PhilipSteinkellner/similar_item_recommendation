The biggest drawback for me is that the female lead, Nicolette Sheridan is too old for this part! She is 10 years older than Dan Payne and it is very obvious. A younger woman would have made the romantic relationship more realistic! Dan Payne is excellent as the nanny to the 2 children and he is always a joy to watch in any movie. He was such a natural and had such a good rapport with the kids, it's easy to see that he is use to being around kids. Jayne Eastwood is a treasure and excellent actress and is definitely a plus to any movie she's in. The 2 children do a great job. They were very natural for being so young."],
