         "Can you go back in your memory and find a key day that was the start of your life as you know it now? Who were the people around you then? What was your favourite song? Was there maybe a special piece of clothing that brings memories flooding back with a smile? What about the food you loved those days? Iconic details. Where are they burned in your brain like a hit song, a movie masterpiece, an unstoppable feeling. When did your life first explode? Somewhere those images are a picture of who you are. Maybe it was getting married. Your first child. Leaving home. Passing your driving test. Getting your Amex Gold. Or falling in love. Moving house. Losing your virginity. Starting university. Finding religion. Getting stoned. Discovering you were someone else all along. Take five people. Take five days. Define the tingles at either end of their spines. Who they are to themselves. To each other. The family in which they are all, somehow, related. The First Day of the Rest of Your Life might not be Magnolia or even American Beauty, but it's damn good fun. This is thumpingly enjoyable entertainment, even with (dare I mention them?) 'subtitles.' In less than two hours, you will feel that you've known Mum and Dad, eldest son Albert, grungy sister Fleur, romantic bro' Raphael all your life. Cos now you know theirs. Blood ties and facts are only one of the ways we relate. Usually the really important bits are a single moment, incident or word. Bits that affect everything else. Bits that define people to you in ways words can't. Intimacies or misunderstandings. Hard decisions taken when you disagree with those you love. Powered by a wonderfully cross-Channel soundtrack, The First Day of the Rest of Your Life is fast and funny. And never flippant. A film for intelligent teenagers who still like to get wasted. For parents struggling to bond. For those in relationships and those struggling to connect. It's not often I feel I can recommend a film to nearly everyone I know (barring subtitles allegies). But I'll stick my neck out and say this is one. It's a symphonic comedy. Of finding yourself alone in the midst of those who love you. Taking pride in yourself even if no-one remembers. Of finally getting through to someone. It could almost be the thinking feelgood film of the year if it wasn't in French (maybe they'll dub it for America??) To get such a complex mix right is masterpiece of modern editing. But the filmmakers have also been astutely conscious of the need to define key experiences in terms audiences can relate to rather than just the way they are experienced by the characters. A love of grunge and praying at Jim Morrison's grave, for instance, does not translate into inflicting Nirvana and the Doors on us. Rather, music is used in classic style to communicate feelings. Or Bowie: Time - He's waiting in the wings . . . His script is you and me, boy There are plenty of senseless things in the First Day of the Rest of Your Life. Believe me � air guitar has never looked so cool. But there are enough really cool, heart-warming moments to make it more than worth your ticket price. It doesn't hit the intellectual self-awareness heights about dysfunctional families that it is capable of � life, death, trust and infidelity, burying your dog, nicotine patches, feng shui, confiscated joints, premature ejaculation and facelifts � none of this matters and yet it does. And as polished all-round entertainment, this film is fairly hard to beat. If you disagree, maybe be you're taking life too seriously and not seriously enough. Sometimes it's hard (as every film critic knows). To just stop analysing long enough to smell the grass. In literary terms, it amounts to Mrs Dalloway buying the flowers herself.",
         "I've just finished watching this for the second time as it overwhelmed me emotionally the first time and I had to check if it was just the wine. Well, it wasn't. It's a marvellous film - beautifully crafted, played by a cast of quality actors, great soundtrack. Watching this film reminded me of why we need the French film industry. Today I saw Toy Story 3 (not a bad instalment in the franchise, but nothing special) with my 9-year old daughter and as we came out of the auditorium, I looked around and saw ads for (1) an animated dog flick for kids, (2) a standard \"blockbuster\" CGI-fest, all shot in blue and (3) a loads-of-explosions bog standard actioner. Why is no-one making films about reality anymore? Are the lives of real people no longer worth considering? Why is Hollywood producing such a deluge of crap these days? La Premier Jour de la Reste de ma Vie tells the story of a family by way of a few individual days over the course of c15 years. Don't expect any contrived pivotal moments of misunderstanding - this film is above that. It shows the conflicts between family members and the frustration and bitterness, yet attempts to demonstrate how these rifts came about. It also shows how people learn from the failures of their parents and how they try not to repeat them. Look up the poem \"This be the Lesson\" by Philip Larkin for how important this is... It is also about love, the bonds of family, redemption, nostalgia and if the final scene doesn't have tears pissing from your eyes, then you have no heart.",
         "Yes we've already watched this kind of movie... Yes the different \"life issues\" and/or \"family issues\" that are exposed are quite classic... But I really enjoyed watching this movie. The actors and actresses are very good, the musical atmosphere is great too, and the situations or dialogs made me laughed quite often. It's a typical french movie, describing the different parts of a human life, from first life experiments to \"old age\" crises. The love that exists in the family looks real, pure, and is stronger than all the ordeals the different family members will encounter. A real sweet time I had by watching this movie, you can go!",
         "Yes, and I thought to what I wrote ! When I saw this film, it was the first time that all of the characters made me share their emotions and laughs. Amazing ! A very nice film, treated well. I particularly love the way of filming. It's also the first time I saw such a devotion to one film. Really interesting. The audio fits perfectly with the film. The problem, as you surely know it, is \"the family\". Every character is perfect in his or her role, and no one can doubt about that ! Three words : buy and see !",
         "Watched this at a London preview screening This was a cleverly structured drama depicting a lengthy span of a family's life by rolling the events of one day in each phase of their lives. Its so well done that you really care about how their lives pan out. I felt it conveyed a message that life is too short to waste, so make the most of it. Bizarrely though, there's one message that seems rather twisted, you can only really enjoy yourself if you smoke something with a bit of kick in it! OK..I'll go try that... How their lives pan out can be a tad predictable because this has been done before. But this movie rolls with so much panache, drama, nostalgia, a superb soundtrack, and lots of humour. In fact I laughed out loud a few times. The performances are uniformly excellent, especially the actor playing the father. He doesn't say much but you can read so much in his subtle expressions. I think this is a film that has got such a universal appeal which most people can relate to in some way. Its highly entertaining and very well paced.",
         "Realistic, funny, honest, gritty with fantastic music! What more could you ask for? I wish I could find the soundtrack for this as each song fits each moment perfectly (whichever emotion it is trying to portray). I found myself caught between laughing & (almost) crying throughout the entire film. I am sure each person can relate to something in at least one of the characters... the angsty rebellious teenager, the hopeless romantic, the 'drop out', the couple who has fallen out of love and the doctor who is stuck in a job he doesn't love and a relationship he is not happy in. The acting in this movie is simply fantastic. It is structured around five key moments in a family's life and is such a fun, inspiring movie which plays with all of the different relationships between father & son, mother & daughter and of course, husband & wife. It may sound intense or grim, but in fact I found this film to be (along with some intense moments of course), full of light and fluffy feel-good moments too. You will see each character's different perspective on life and how they grow, which makes interesting watching. From the start to the end, I just loved it. Don't be put off by the subtitles - you don't need to understand French to understand this wonderful movie!",
         "I thought that \"THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF YOUR LIFE\" (aka \"Le premier jour du reste de ta vie\") was a thoroughly enjoyable movie � it is a film that I would contemplate seeing again � (and maybe again!) �. Well written and superbly directed by Remi Bezancon, \"The first day� \" is a French film (with subtitles) telling the tale of a close knit family over a period of twelve years � and especially focusing on five individual crucial days in particular over that period that changed the course of the families life for ever � I just liked everything about this film, the casting was superb, the music great, the way the story moved along was brisk and to the point � and you felt at one with the family � at some points I was very moved � at others I laughed out loud � there wasn't a bad thing to say about this movie ... A special mention should go the actors playing the main Duval family members � such good believable actors � the Father - Robert (Jacques Gamblin), the Mother Marie-Jeanne (Zabou Breitman), their Daughter Fleur (Deborah Francois), and their two sons Raphael (Marc-Andre Grondin) and Albert (Pio Marmai) � I'm sure that there will be many more good things to come from these actors (and the director) in the future � This film is a joy � you share the hardships and the highlights and get totally immersed in the family and their circumstances � \"THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF YOUR LIFE\" is released on 20th November, and is thoroughly recommended �",
         "I've never seen life of a family captured so well on screen, this film is really magnifique. It is about a French family as they grow older and face realities of life. There is nothing extraordinary on screen, only an immense emotional beauty, a portrait of the life of a family. Not an ordinary portrait but a master one. I am so touched also for personal reasons, having small kids and reaching an age where I understand that I am not immortal and death will come hopefully after many many years. One of the cover photos where the kid is showing her tongue, it is the stage we are at. It just makes me sit down and cry, not because of sadness but you know the saying that before a person dies s/he watches her/his own life like a film. I am guessing the filmmakers had this in their minds. Also I like the fact that the film was not not pushing or leading me like most Hollywood movies. The script flows naturally, harmonically, without effort and this is important to convey the emotions related to family life. I also wish such filmmakers will have budgets that enable them to spend more on cinematography. With better cinematography, this film would devastate me. Absolutely beautiful and sad and funny. I am not a fan of French cinema but with more titles like this, I am sure that I will be.",
         "I found this French film from the writer/director Ŕemi Beanc̗on intriguing. The first quarter of the film initially engaged the professional me; that part that is a child and adolescent psychologist; with an impressionistic overlay of happily narcissistic and negligent parenting and spends the rest of the film unfolding the effect of this on the three children and even in a somewhat family therapy and Lacanian way showing how this bad habit of self absorption can be traced back three generations. However, I don't want to make the film sound heavy or preachy. It remains light and real and the only heaviness is the dramatically impactful incidents which evolve from these well sketched dynamics. Besides, the musical me was delighted by a perfect scene from the late 70's which had me reflecting that I had not played air guitar with quite such élan and enthusiasm since exactly that time. Also note the plot line that follows one of the male brothers frustrating failure to follow through on a truly kismetic introduced love interest. Superb, light but deep film about what carelessly inattentive parenting can do to all those (or that's the joke isn't it? � uninvolved with the result). Depths left unexplored in The Movie Show. Four stars from me. Beautiful.",
         "I must say I've seen a lot of movies but rarely I feel so much drawn into this kind of stories. Believe me, it's a sign of a good movie! I immediately saw great camera angles and this follows the film throughout. I love the movement of the camera, following the story acted out by good actors in a script that is funny and well written. On top of that, the film has a great musical score. We go right into what is an average French family. Man and wife and two grown up kids. Time to have a life crisis or four. Mum and dad is no longer having sex, the daughter feels estranged and the son procrastinating. More shouldn't be told, though it's an everyday story from a French middle class family. The film is funny, still it's able to balance into both sentimentality as swell as sadness. Typically French, but in a good way. The latter years I think the French film industry has turned out a lot of great films, and again French film is something you awaits the best from. This is another example of such a film. Well done!"
