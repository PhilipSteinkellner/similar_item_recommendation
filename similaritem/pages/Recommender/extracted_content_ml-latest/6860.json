         "This is one of those guilty pleasure movies for me...it combines elements of the great mob movies with fast paced and hard hitting action. For the most part, the director pulls this one off pretty well, at least for what kind of movie he was trying to direct. I've been reading a lot of comments stating that this movie can't hold a candle anywhere near Goodfellas or Godfather or even Donnie Brasco (all of which are excellent movies). Well, all I have to say is, NO, REALLY?!? I mean come on, with a cast like Christian Slater, Patrick Dempsey and Richard Grieco, what were you expecting? Another Vito Corleone or Lefty Luggiero? This one is aimed at a younger audience (perhaps teens to mid twenties) and I have to admit, they pull it off rather nicely. What I mean is that the movie, though serious throughout, does not try to be an epic, only a high octane crowd pleaser. The action scenes are bloody and well done, and the sets are lovely. Even the acting is surprisingly good, especially Patrick Dempsey and dare I say, Richard '21 Jump Street' Grieco. What kills me about this flick is that, though it is an exciting movie and a more than anything else, an effective time killer, the direction cuts from scene to scene getting straight to the point and little else. This seriously detracts from characterization and overall storytelling (I totally agree with other viewers who said that this movie should be at least an hour longer). I mean, at the beginning, we are vaguely introduced to our protagonists, and then five minutes later, they are in their twenties, and have already established themselves as small time crooks. How? Movies like Goodfellas and Once Upon a Time in America are great movies partly b\\c they had wonderful scenes of the main characters as children, so we can see their motives when they eventually become mobsters. This one, like I said, jumps from one scene to another, not wasting a second on dramatic pauses or even characterization. It seriously reminds you of a cookie-cutter Jerry Bruckheimer production, minus the explosions. It does have nice touches here and there of authentic 1920-1930's life and old movies depicting that era which gives the film class (the tunes, the model-T's, the dancers, the neighborhoods and finally, the spinning newspaper headlines) instead of just being another Young Guns meets the Goodfellas. However, as I said, the film's objective, to make a fast paced mafia movie with popular actors suceeds, but it also leads to its biggest downfall of limited characterization. It is hard to feel for (or despise) characters without knowing their background all too well...all we get is, hey Lucky had a hard life, Benny likes to kill people, Don Massaria is fat, the other Don is a bad fella...anyway you catch my drift. All in all, not a bad film, though it should have been longer. Watch this one only when it's on cable or when you have time to kill, for it is rather visually pleasing and entertaining. Overall, it is a movie that doesn't pretend to be something it's not, it's a decent film with a lot of action and good performances. I give it 7/10 stars.",
         "I must say, I don't really agree with what most other people have to say about this movie. I must admit it has its ups and downs, especially when it comes to the casting. Casting Christian Slater as Lucky Luciano was just ridiculous. He is just so the wrong type. He is a good actor, but this part does not suit him at all! It is a different story for several other people. I must say I was very impressed with the performances of Richard Grieco and Lara Flynn Boyle. Richard clearly shows he can do a lot more than just being the pretty boy. He was probably the best choice for the part. Violent and sensual. He even manages to do a quite funny scene, when his character gets angry, because someone tells him he does not kill with style. I did not know what to expect from him, as I had only seen him in \"21 Jump Street\", but give him a chance, because he will not disappoint you. Lara Flynn Boyle's performance is wonderful. Too bad her part was so small, as I would have loved to see more of her in this movie. She shows here clearly she can do so much more than cheap comedies. Usually I would give this film 8 out of 10, but because of Richard and Lara, I will make it 9.",
         "This movie is based on the rise of four leading organised crime figures, from the end of WW 1 to the early thirties. The central character, Charles (Lucky) Luciano (Christian Slater)is credited, if that's the right word, for introducing modern corporate governance to a group of organisations previously based on ethnic affiliation and loyalty to a chief. So, in the movie he and his associates Meyer Lansky, Frank Costello and Bugsy Siegel works to bring down two aging Dons whose time has come. The Dons, played by Anthony Quinn and Michael Gambon, are certainly ruthless, but their imaginations are limited. The young turks on the other hand see new markets and new alliances. In the new mafia, Irishmen, Russian Jews and others work alongside Italians. The period is evoked beautifully in shades of brown and cream. Unfortunately many scenes have a certain sameness to them - a couple of hoods meet in some office or hotel for a delicate business chat, each armed to the teeth. When an impass is reached the guns blaze away. This gets boring after a while and you start to wonder why they don't use the phone sometimes. It isn't because the FBI are after them (the IRS was a bit more successful) and they have the New York cops in their pocket. There are some very bloody scenes depicted with gratuitious graphicness. Luciano and to a lesser extent Lansky are quite sympathetically depicted, with many of the killings being of \"let's kill them before they kill us variety.\" Poor old Tony Quinn is put down not even able to remember the guy whose death is being avenged. One thing that does come out is that organised crime was in the US long before the prohibition era, but the money made then financed the mob into many other areas, pre-eminently gambling in Cuba and Las Vegas. Meyer Lansky was the biggest investor in the early Vegas casino the \"Flamingo\", opened I think, by Bugsy Siegal. This is a moderately interesting account, though with some substantial departures from the historical record. Apart from all the gore my objection to it is that it glamourises some very nasty people who did a great deal of damage to American public life. The FBI, and all its attacks on civil liberties, justified its existence by reference to organised crime, yet did little to stop it. After the time covered by the film Luciano was imprisoned not through the efforts of the FBI but through those of NY prosecutor Thomas Dewey. Luciano was eventually deported to Italy, after assisting the OSS, forerunner of the CIA, in their wartime dealings with the Sicilian mafia. Al Capone, a bit player here, was famously imprisoned for tax evasion. Meyer Lansky was charged with tax evasion in the early 1970s, but beat the rap. He died peacfully at 81 in retirement in Florida. His family not only maintain his grave, but also a web site about him.",
         "As much as I love Gangster movies there is something that is not quite right about this film.Im not sure the problem is that the actors are just a little bit too young to pull it off if the film should have been an hour longer as there seems to be too much squeezed into 100 minutes. Having said all that i did enjoy this film. Christian Slater has a charm all of his own and is good as Lucky Luciano. Nice and Violent as well! 6 out of 10",
         "I couldn't believe that this movie was going to be even somewhat good after looking at the cover of the box. Boy, was I wrong, Mobsters sure did not disappoint me and I think I've seen just about every mafia/mob movie ever made in the last 50 years. I'm not saying this goes up there with Goodfellas and The Godfathers, etc, but it definitely deserves some credit. The acting for the most part is very well-done. There is some good action with a fair amount of bloodshed, great set designs, and a good cast. I'm not sure exactly how historically accurate this movie is, but nevertheless, it pulls through to bring an overall excellent mob flick.",
         "I have loved this film since it came out and I can't believe some of the comments! Did you really expect another Goodfellas from the Brat Pack? Or did you just watch the film so you could confirm your suspicions and have a good moan? The film is very entertaining and well acted. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino may be good actors but the cast of this film is much easier on the eye(!) and I don't think you can fault the acting in this film. Patrick Dempsey and Christian Slater are particularly good in their roles. Stop being so judgemental and accept the film for what it is - an entertaining action flick loosely based on real events. If you expect a history lesson from the cinema you are bound to be disappointed!",
         "Mobsters casts four young players of the day as four of the legendary gangland figures of the 20th Century in their salad days. Christian Slater, Patrick Dempsey, Richard Grieco, and Costas Mandylor play Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel, and Frank Costello respectively. The film is a fictionalized account of how the four of them wound up on top of the gangland heap. Michael Gambon and Anthony Quinn play the two old style Mobsters who are rivals for the title of boss of all bosses in the New York City area. Playing Charles Ferranzano and Joe Masseria the two of them control most of the illegal liquor trade which gave organized crime in this country it's real foothold. But our young men prove to be tough, smart and resilient as they play off the two old bosses against the middle. Mobsters as a film captures the ambiance of New York during prohibition very well. I'm not sure I would have cast Christian Slater as Lucky Luciano, still Slater does very well with the part. Richard Grieco as Bugsy Siegel is very good, you can see the genesis of Warren Beatty's character when he played Siegel in his film, Bugsy. Note should also be mentioned of F. Murray Abraham as Twenties gambler Arnold Rothstein who was the initial sponsor of the young mobsters in training. And Nick Sadler is one frightening Mad Dog Coll. You'll see quite graphically where his nickname came from. Mobsters is good viewing, not exactly historically accurate, but actually sticks closer to the truth than most films of this type.",
         "I have always been very interested in the mob from early 1900 to the 50's. This film didn't disappoint me, probably because I wasn't expecting much. I knew this film was just made in order to get 4 young rising actors on screen together. Those actors being Christian Slater whom would later go to star in Brocken Arrow with John Trovolta. Patrick Dempsey who plays Meyer Lansky, Richard Grieco who plays Bugsy Siegel (The man who made Las Vegas) and Costas Mandylor as Frank Costello. The film feels very rushed and it seems the producers were more interested in the action rather than story which is interesting on its own. THe characters arnt developed very well but as someone who has read up on all of them I felt as if I already knew them. Christian Slater does the best but looks nothing like the real Luciano. The film was too short running in at around 105 minutes. I think the director's and writers should have sat down and watched GOODFELLAS which was made the year before.",
         "This is a good mafia movie,with good story telling,good acting and good atmosphere.I really enjoy mafia movies,and therefore I think this movie is underrated.The story is not unlike other mafia movies,about robbing each other and killing everyone in the way,but off course with class. Highly underrated,good movie.",
         "It's New York in the 20s. The men exemplify sartorial splendor and the women are buffed. The photography has a burnished glow to it. The men are all Italians or Jews and they sit around a big table and proffer business deals. They gesture a good deal, running off at the hands. They greet one another operatically, with big smiles and hugs, and statements like, \"'Ey, you lookin' good. It's been too long.\" They're all loving friends except that behind each others' backs they scheme like nobody's business (or \"bidness\") to kill one another. Then they break out the .45 caliber choppers and God help the Capo sitting at his table slurping down rigatoni and that glass of robust red vino. He's going to wind up with heartburn. I kind of enjoy movies like this, about big-name mobsters with names like Bugsy Siegel and Lucky Luciano and Mad Dog Coll and Meyer Lansky. I thrill at the way the writers slightly bend the story so that we sympathize with, in this instance, Christian Slater as Luciano. He's the central figure -- and he's basically a VIRTUOUS MAN. He never kills anybody unless there's a very good reason for it. And the better the reason, the more bloody and barbarous the slaughter is. He catches Mad Dog Coll unawares and empties his Tommy Gun into the squirming body. The explosion of so many squib charges has never before been committed to celluloid. You remember how Sonny Corleone, James Caan, gets shot up at the turnpike entrance in \"The Godfather\"? That was nothing compared to what happens to Mad Dog Coll. My understanding is that our real, contemporaneous mobsters sit around enjoying these movies and chuckling over them, wondering, only half dreamily, who's going to play THEM in the next Mafia movie. The fact is, though, that this isn't very original. Roger Corman did it just as well twenty or thirty years earlier, on a lesser budget, and with tongue in cheek. This film tries desperately to be a serious look at what long ago became a joke. The sources that have been ripped off are not only gangster movies, beginning with \"Little Caesar\" and meandering through The Godfathers and Goodfellas, picking a bit here and a shtick there, but hard-core pornography. There are just enough plot points established -- who's bedding whom, who has a grudge against whom, and how about that tentative meeting between rivals -- to justify the more interesting scenes, the ones everyone is waiting for, sex in pornography, stupendous violence in \"Mobsters.\" You haven't lived until you see a scarlet pool of gore spilling viscously across the tiled floor of a steam bath. Frankly, I'm getting a little jaded. I don't care if these moral morons protected their wives, loved their girl friends, went to the opera, enjoyed rugala, disliked fluorescent light bulbs, wanted to save the pandas, or had a magnificent stamp collection. It's the one percent of the time when they are putting a bullet through someone's forehead that bothers me. Showing us their human side amounts to a sort of apologia. You know -- I'm fundamentally decent. I just have this piacular quirk. They don't deserve this favorable propaganda. They deserve long jail terms, but then a lot of people belong in jail who are now sailing on Long Island Sound."
