         "The story follows the life of Ryunosuke Tsukue (played by Raizo Ichikawa), an amoral samurai and a master swordsman with an unorthodox style. Ryunosuke is first seen when he kills an elderly Buddhist pilgrim for no reason and with no apparent feeling. Later, he deliberately kills an opponent in a fencing competition that was intended to be non-lethal. This latter act forces him to leave his home town, but not before he fights his way through an ambush, killing perhaps a dozen samurai in the process. To make a living, Ryunosuke joins the Shinsengumi, a sort of semi-official police force made up of ronin that supports the Tokugawa shogunate through murder and assassinations. Through all his interactions, whether killing a man or at home with his mistress and their baby son, Ryunosuke rarely shows any emotion. His expression is fixed in a glassy stare that suggests a quiet insanity. Ryunosuke slowly descends into complete insanity in the final 15 minutes and the movie ends on a cliff-hanger note with a duel that isn't materialised. OK first things first, this is a Kenji Misumi picture, so it can't be all that bad. But in the same time it's obvious that Misumi here is still learning the ropes, his directing pretty much by-the-numbers, even though flashes of the brilliance he would show in consequent years are still evident. He was a contract director for Daei at the time, before the studio's bankruptcy. He would go on to craft perhaps the best series in the cinema's history, Lone Wolf and Cub. Here we see his early steps in the genre, totally bloodless in case you're wondering. I believe the first movie to introduce the arterial spray we all love is Kurosawa's Sanjuro that came out two years later. Now if you came all the way here to read this review, you should already be familiar with Kihachi Okamoto's masterpiece, Sword of Doom, from 1966. Okamoto's Daibosatsu Toge (as is the Japanese title) is a remake very faithful to the original. Going against every remake rule, it is also superior in every aspect. Raizo Ichikawa is not a patch on Tatsuya Nakadai, one of the most imposing actors I have ever seen. Everything from the b/w cinematography to the acting to the swordfights to the plot is three or four scales above in Sword of Doom. Misumi's earlier version comes very short by comparison. However if you HAVE seen Sword of Doom and you're a chambara fan, you could do a lot worse than check out Misumi's Satan's Sword.. Okamoto's remake follows Misumi's picture to the hilt, most scenes are almost identical in how they play out. Imagine Gus Van Sant's shot by shot remake of Psycho and you're close. OK now that we've got that out of the way, let's see what this one has going for it. Raizo Ichikawa leaves a lot to be desired (especially because one cannot help but picture Nakadai in the same role), but the movie is fairly entertaining, the swordfights are quite good (although there's no blood I repeat) and Misumi's exterior photography is good. The most important reason to get Misumi's Satan's Sword trilogy though is to see the story of Ryunosuke Tsuke evolving in the next two sequels. Okamoto's Sword of Doom was supposed to have sequels which never materialised, so if you were miffed by its abrupt ending, here's your only chance to see the conclusion of Tsukue's tragic story. Overall not an essential chambara entry by any means, but Sword of Doom and fans of the genre will be pleasantly entertained.",
         "The movie Satan's Sword is adopted from Kaizan Nakazato's famous novel Daibosatu Touge(also known as The Great Bodhisattva Pass).It is Japan's one of the most famous novels and filmed 5 times. It has been said that Nakazato Kaizan wrote this to describe human karma based on Buddhism. The story in this trilogy is about 20% of the whole story in his novel. This is the first movie of the Satan's Sword trilogy. The story of Tsukue Ryunosuke, an amoral swordsman who slays other people with no apparent reason pursued by the brother of his fencing competition victim, he wanders through the country in the end of Edo period gradually deepening his insanity. I'd like to skip repeating details of the movie since other users had already done it with their reviews. Instead, I am going to state my personal opinion about a theme (hidden message) of this movie, and Raizo Ichikawa's portrayal of Ryunosuke and how it was played out. \"Satan's Sword\" wasn't made to only show spectacular sword fights or to demonstrate bad guy verses good guy type of story. The theme of this movie is something that causes viewers to look at a dark side of reality in the life. \"Satan's Sword\" was directed much closer to the original novel than Chiezo Kataoka (aka Souls in the Moonlight) and Tatsuya Nakadai ( Sword of Doom) versions. Ryunosuke's inner turmoil and detachment from the world around him were well played by Raizo Ichikawa. His play is subtle but there is some quiet intensity in Ichikawa himself that is worked to magnify Ryunosuke's inner turmoil. His expression of motion (force)within stillness, or motion in the still, is a characteristic of samurai and worked very well in portraying Ryunosuke. Because Ichikawa was young (29) the time he played, Ryunosuke's nihilism wasn't well portrayed but his deep voice and his unique kabuki style speaking created a distinctive Ryunosuke character. When compared with Chiezo Kataoka and Tatsuya Nakadai versions of the same title movies, I liked Ichikawa version better because his Ryunosuke wasn't portrayed as nearly psychopath as in Nakadai version. I am almost certain that Ryunosuke in Nakazato's original novel wasn't psychopath or insane. Although Ryunosuke is an amoral lost soul, possessed by his sword, and has no sympathy to others, these do not necessarily make him insane or mentally ill. However, Kataoka version Ryunosuke is little too old and he doesn't seem all the way amoral. An astonishing final scene in the third movie of the trilogy left me with some feelings of confusion and helplessness but it allowed me to think something more. Perhaps, within the lingering feelings with a room for thought, there is the message of the Satan's Sword trilogy. All in all, the movie \"Satan's sword\" was filmed by the best technical stuff of the Daiei at that time. The visual effect in this movie is stunningly beautiful and every scene settings were masterfully done. It was a creation of Japanese movie golden era. This is a great movie in its message (theme), scale and artistic means that fully entertaining. I highly recommend people to watch all three movies of the Satan's Sword.",
         "Based on a long running (and unfinished) novel by Kaizan Nakazato that ran on various newspapers (Miyako, Mainichi, and Yomiuri to be exact) from 1913 to 1941, Daibosatsu Toge (The Great Bodhisattva Path) is a story that's set towards the end of Tokugawa Shogunate's reign about group of people that comes in contact with main character Ryunosuke Tsukue (Raizo Ichikawa). Ryunosuke Tsukue is a swordsman in his 30s who was born in the village of Sawai near by Daibosatsu Toge. His father ran a sword fighting school and he himself is a master of the Kogen Ittoryu sword fighting style. He is totally selfish and pitiless, and when he was young, he used to go out to the path to cut down innocent passer by with his sword. One old man he cut down was the grandfather of Omatsu (Fujiko Yamamoto) who he will come in contact with later in his life. In a sword fighting match, he kills Monnojo Utsuki, but earlier, he rapes Monnojo's wife Ohama (Tamao Nakamura) who came to beg for her husband's honor by not accepting the match (because it was obvious that her husband will lose). But because he killed Monnojo, he gets targeted for assassination by Monnojo's friends, and must leave Sawai Village. Ohama decides to follow Ryunosuke. Monnojo's brother Hyoma (Kojiro Hongo) also starts to chase Ryunosuke to avenge his brother's death. He goes to Edo (old name for Tokyo) and joins Shinsengumi (which was like a vigilante police force), and has a child Ikutaro with Ohama. He tries to assassinate Ryunosuke Shimada who's a teacher of Hyoma, with his colleagues but for the first time, loses. This confounds Ryunosuke, and he gets into a quarrel with Ohama, and kills her. He then heads out to Kyoto and is asked by the head of Shinsengumi, Kamo Serizawa to join them, but due to the memory of killing Ohama, Ryunosuke goes into hallucination, and in delusion he swings his sword wildly where he is seen by Hyoma and Hyoma challenges him to a match. This is the first of a trilogy, and there're two more movies that follows. The novel is epic length so they couldn't fit all the story into single movie. Daibosatsu Toge has been made into movies five times since 1935. The novel itself was never concluded. It ended when its author died, so there's no ending to this story. In the end, the story goes into fictitious realm that doesn't follow the actual history, and all the characters starts to wander various parts of Japan in the year 1868. This is one of the most edgiest samurai movie ever made, and it's that way because of the character of Ryunosuke. He absolutely cares for no one, and with his ability to kill, makes him one destructive instrument to himself and people around him. Raizo Ichikawa who played Ryunosuke (twice as he also played the part in the previous release of this movie) himself had a very short life dying at the age of 37. Out of all, versions, this movie has the most beautiful women playing the parts. Tamao Nakamura was great as Ohama/Otoyo. It was a year before she married Shintaro Katsu who played the original Zatoichi the blind swordsman. Fujiko Yamamoto who played Omatsu was always renowned for her beauty. All these casts makes this an exceptional movie to watch. One of the must see samurai movies of all time, Daibosatsu Toge is one of the best movie ever made samurai or otherwise.",
         "My missus, who is Japanese, tells me that Raizo Ichikawa was a very big star around the time this film was made. Well, I can't say he does much for me. In fact, I think his mostly minimal acting style is one of the reasons that this film, first of a trilogy, is fairly uninteresting. The effeminate yet deep-voiced Raizo plays a swordfighter with superb skills in the slashing department but minimal skills in relationships. A lot more could have happened than actually did, and it took quite a long time about it. The main enjoyment of this picture is some of the great costumes, period interior decorating and architecture and scenery. The other two films are better, but only slightly."
