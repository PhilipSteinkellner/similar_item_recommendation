         "Most barbarian flicks are ONLY as good as their damsels in distress, or if you're REAL lucky, their damsels who INFLICT distress. This Argentina-lensed epic boasts BOTH and sets its tone right off when a blonde waif (Dawn Dunlap), absently picking flowers along a river, is attacked by a pair of, um, barbarians who howl something while dropping trou like, \"Nothing like a VIRGIN to brighten a man's morning!\" Clearly, it's a family picture. While back at the village, the victim's big sis Amethea (Lana Clarkson) is indulging in a ceremonial bath with her closest gal pals in honor of her wedding day. But this preening party ends when hordes of snarling troops overrun the village slashing at the throats and limbs of everyone in sight. Amethea narrowly survives and vows vengeance against this savagery and to reunite with her beefy beau's loins (Frank Zagarino). A whole lot happens afterward, yet none is as memorable as when the can-tastic Ms. Clarkson is strapped topless on a rack in a damp dungeon where escape would surely be impossible if not for the raw might of her vice-grip -- gulp! -- VAGINA! Dr. Kegel would be proud. CineSchlockers should note that both Lana and her rack returned for the non-sequel sequel Barbarian Queen II: The Empress Strikes Back. 31 breasts. 67 corpses. Nipple painting. Acid-washed horndog. Gratuitous blind fortune teller. Face biting. Amethea brazenly declares her quest, \"I'll be no man's slave and no man's whore! And if I can't kill them all, by the gods, they'll know I've tried!\"",
         "I was in college when this film was released and it really made an impression on me. Now, I'm not saying that it moved me to deep philosophical thinking. Rather, this movie is one that can be seen in fast-forward mode on your VCR and you won't miss a bit of the plot (which I'll give in a bit). The impression it made on me was one of Lana Clarkson, who plays the lead role, topless and tied to an upright rack while she's tortured with a needle by a smallish man with large glasses. Now the reason she's there: Amathea (Lana Clarkson) was about to be married to the prince of her village when soldiers charge in and slaughter just about everyone. The prince is captured and Amathea escapes into the woods where she joins up with 3 other warriors. They plan to go to the city and rescue the prince. Along the way they manage to kill a few straggling soldiers, rescue a woman tied to fence who's topless and has been whipped, and make friends with rebels seeking to overthrow the local ruler. Amathea's sister allows herself to be captured by the ruler so that she can be his concubine and Amathea is captured while trying to rescue her. The king thinks Amathea is part of the rebel movement and orders her to be tortured until she identifies the rebel leaders. After the 5 minute torture scene, Amathea throws the torturer into a vat of acid and escapes, freeing the gladiators and the prince and creating a mediocre fight scene wherein the ruler is overthrown and the people are free. Don't see this movie for the plot. Don't see it for the dialogue. You'll want to see it because the 4 main actresses in the film eventually have nude scenes in this order: rape, nipple play, wrestling, woman on the fence topless, rape, stripped topless, Lana's torture scene. The rape scenes are weak, the wrestling is short. I'm convinced that the only reason they made a sequel was to show Lana Clarkson on a rack again (see \"Barbarian Queen II\"). Unless you're into bad barbarian sword-and-sandle movies, mild rape, Lana Clarkson, and/or bondage, you can skip this movie. Me, I saw it for Lana Clarkson.",
         "The Barbarian Queen is Queen Amethea (Lana Clarkson), whose village is burned by evil warriors on the day of her prospective wedding, after which most of the people are killed or enslaved. She leads a group of rebels in opposition, including some women (like herself) whose forms fit well into the clothing of the day, and eventually leads an uprising by freeing the slaves. Not for its cultural or intellectual value at all, this film is most noteworthy for the women winning the swordfights with men but not faring so well if they are captured and/or enslaved. Nudity and bondage and fondling yes, but I have to say the most memorable scene occurs when Queen Amethea uses a unique method of escape after she has been captured and tied up in the warrior camp and is being fondled by one of her captors. Clear cut--for those who like this stuff yes, otherwise not much to offer.",
         "Barbarian Queen is one of the cycle of sword and sandal flicks that were popular in the mid 80's. Back then the formula seemed to incorporate lots of sword fights and lots of semi naked girls. This flick certainly adheres to this principle that's for sure, especially the bit about the naked girls. In fact I guess if you were inclined towards political correctness you could label Barbarian Queen as a film that is a little bit sexist. But I myself am quite partial to salacious genre movies and I lapped this one up quite a bit. The story really isn't too important but suffice to say it features a group of Amazonian type women on a quest to get vengeance on a tribe of incredibly misogynistic men who opened up the movie by raping and murdering their people. There's lots of sex and violence in this one. And for what it's worth, the breast count appeared to be astronomical as well. It's certainly a movie that delivers on its promise and that is certainly not a bad thing. Lana Clarkson plays the titular heroine with some gusto. She's pretty good in the action scenes as well as the nude ones. Of the latter there is a somewhat erotic scene where she is tied up in a torture chamber. Somewhat notably, she escapes from this seemingly doomed situation by defeating her jailer by way of a rather extreme application of the Cleopatra Grip (I'll let you look that one up!). You have to give a film marks for originality for the likes of this, that's for sure. Barbarian Queen has a story and action that is by-the-numbers really but it gains points for gratuitous excess. They don't really seem to make them like this anymore and that is a bit of a shame.",
         "After surviving a brutal attack on her village on the day of her wedding to a tribal prince (Frank Zagarino), a tough female warrior (the late Lana Clarkson) seeks revenge. With the help of two equally powerful warriors (Katt Shea, Susana Traverso), she recruits more rebels before taking the battle to an evil army led by an evil king (Arman Chapman). Silly, poorly acted (and poorly dubbed) romp is loaded with action and gratuitous nudity (just about every female bares it all, including Clarkson). Nothing original here, except the heroine using her vagina as a weapon against one of her captors and he complains that she's \"too tight.\" Trashy and entertaining at the same time. My evaluation: ** out of ****.",
         "A horde of vile degenerate pervert marauders led by the evil Lord Arrakur (robustly overplayed with deliciously hammy aplomb by Arman Chapman) pillage a small peaceful village. They kill most of the guys and have their wicked nasty way with the ladies. Feisty warrior Queen Amethea (winningly essayed with delightful go-for-it spunky relish by the gorgeously voluptuous Lana Clarkson; Kaira in \"Deathstalker\") and several luscious female companions (who include future director Katt Shea Ruben of \"Stripped to Kill\" and \"Dance of the Damned\" fame) go to Arrakur's kingdom to free their people. They get caught instead, but manage to escape so they can get a group of rebels and Arrakur's gladiators to join forces to overthrow Arrakur's cruel reign of tyranny at the film's stirring conclusion. Directed with suitably lowbrow flair by Hector Olivera, this gleefully trashy low-budget sword and sorcery fantasy action exploitation romp certainly delivers the expected sleazy goods with a pleasing blend of energy and abundance: we're got plenty of priceless dopey dialogue (all-time favorite line: \"You're much too beautiful a girl to let yourself be broken into food for the royal dogs\"), a constant speedy pace, lots of gratuitously bared distaff skin on frequent display (cute'n'cuddly brunette hottie supreme Dawn Dunlap in particular looks absolutely yummy as Amethea's sweet innocent younger sister Taramis), several exciting gory sword fights, a rousing score by James Horner and Chris Young, and a memorably disgusting bespectacled nerd torturer who uses a metal claw to paw one of Amethea's breasts. Good junky fun.",
         "I watched Barbarian Queen after seeing several movies made by Argentina filmmakers at the United States Film Festival (a.k.a Sundance) back in the 80s. A large chunk of these films were about the just-ended military Junta that took place in that country. Thousand went missing, dead or were tortured during those very black days. One of the films , \"Night of the Pencils,\" was made by the very same director, Hector Olivera, of \"Barbarian Queen.\" Pencils is a serious film that examines the brutalization of several young folk during the Junta years. When I came across Barbarian Queen, I was some what surprised that this obvious exploitation sword and sorcery was made by the same guy. However, some of very anti-Junta sentiments are buried in this rather mercenary Conan rip-off. Barbarian Queen is about a group of villagers taken captive by an evil regime. It also features a sinister and very creepy torture doctor. These are very familiar to the victims of the military Junta. And while the film does wallow in the same rape fantasy that populated a big chunk of these sword & sorcery b-movies, there is one sequence I think that more honestly displays Olivera's view. In that scene, Clarkson comes across a young women that is chained to a pole. She is bruised, beaten, and scarred �not in the least bit sexy. A hideously brutish soldier stands before her. He takes her bruised face in his hands and orders the captive to smile. Clarkson rams a sword through his neck. This lit bit of business is not in the least bit titillating. The last thing we want is for the loathsome soldier to have his way with this broken woman. It is very satisfying when he gets his at the business end of Clarkson's sword. It is quite a powerful scene (probably the best in the movie). I am not foolish enough to look at this sleazy bit of exploitation shot on the cheap by Corman and crew as some sort of political statement. Still, it is kind of interesting to see the impact the Junta made on Olivera creep (perhaps unconsciously) into this Corman quickie. I never would have made the connection at all if I hadn't just seen a bunch of Argentinean movies before this. It certainly makes Barbarian Queen more interesting for me than it probably deserves.",
         "Another awful, but hilarious contribution to the Sword & Sorcery genre starring the late Lana Clarkson, Héctor Oliviera's \"Barbarian Queen\" of 1985, is a film that is absolutely ridiculous in almost any aspect, but that shouldn't be missed by any fan of movies of the \"so bad it's good\" kind. Most of these cheaply produced and trashy Sword & Sorcery (or should I say Boobs & Sorcery) flicks are awful as hell, but they're hilarious unintentional comedies, and \"Barbarian Queen\" is the epitome of such a hilarious (semi?) unintentional comedy. I personally can't help it - I love films of that kind, awful as they may be, and I personally always laugh my ass of and have the time of my life watching them. This little film's thin plot in particular tells the story of 'barbarian queen' Amethea (Lana Clarkson) who, together with a few other busty female warriors, decides to free her tribe from slavery and tyranny after their village has been razed to the ground by a ruthless tyrant. It's often stated that this is set in the times of the Roman empire, but the villains really have nothing Roman about them, I'd say the movie is set in a typical, undefinable Sword'n'Sorcery fantasy time, some of the folks look like medieval knights, others like Barbarians from more ancient times... The whole movie is quite similar to an earlier Lana Clarkson movie, \"Deathstalker\" of 1983, In which she played a role that was almost the same as in this one. I personally enjoyed Deathstaker more, since it was gorier and the unintentional comedy factor was at times even higher, but \"Barbarian Queen\" is definitely also recommended if you're looking for a good laugh. The acting is, unsurprisingly, god-awful, and the settings sometimes make you wonder if the hilarious flaws are really unintentional. Apart from its value as an unintentional comedy, \"Barbarian Queen\" delivers a good amount of sleaze, and a busty female cast that gets topless every five minutes. \"Barbarian Queen\" may be a god-awful film, but people with a sense of humor should have a good time watching it and laughing their asses off.",
         "An unenterprising addition to the (rightly) maligned '80s genre of the sword-and-sorcery movie (you'd be well advised to check out the likes of DEATHSTALKER and THE SWORD AND THE SORCERER instead of this uninspiring dreck) whose sole purpose seems to be to show as many naked women throughout the film as possible. But this isn't soft-core porn by any means; instead it's a low budget action epic, shot on the cheap in Argentina by a talentless bunch of guys who don't know two things about fight choreography (case in point: compare this film with a similar Shaw Brothers sword-fighting epic � no contest). The film deserves note � and perhaps credit � for portraying some feisty and powerful female warriors who easily overthrow their male oppressors, but then proceed to turn this idea on its head by insisting that all of the female performers be naked or raped at one time or another. Although female torture, rape and molestation may sound unpleasant, rest assured that this film portrays the scenes as weakly and routinely as it can, without power. Lana Clarkson (\"I'll be no man's slave and no man's whore! And if I can't kill them all, by the Gods, they'll know I've tried!\") is the Nordic beauty who leads a revolt against the aforementioned oppressors. I think these guys are meant to be Roman but you wouldn't guess, seeing as the costumes are so poor. Most of the film consists of drawn-out action sequences which are really poorly done and much less interesting than any Italian peplum from the '60s you could ever find. The middle section of the film consists of torture and contains an amusing scene of a guy being thrown into an acid bath, but that's about it. Despite the inclusion of some muscular men in a gladiator battle, the excitement level is null. Expect to see lots of naked female flesh and some unwanted naked male flesh. Expect to see poor camera-work, shoddy and unconvincing gore effects and an utterly routine payoff for your time. Expect to see a level of film-making so cheap, unimaginative and unskilled that you can barely bother to watch the movie at all. Expect to see the sequel.",
         "A decent pace, mildly amusing violence, entertaining if not accomplished acting, a rousing score (credited to James Horner and Christopher Young), and abundant female nudity mix in this fantasy action flick. It's really no more than average for the genre, but it does deliver the goods for undemanding fans of sword and sandal schlock. Set during the days of the Roman Empire, it stars the buxom Lana Clarkson as Amethea, one of just a few survivors when her peaceful village is attacked. The men are killed, and the women likewise dispatched, or taken away to be slaves. Amethea teams up with her friend Estrild (played by future director Katt Shea) and the innocent Taramis (Dawn Dunlap) to take on the depraved bad guys, assisted by an underground rebel movement. One has to give these filmmakers credit, as they know exactly what kind of movie they're making. The first shot of a womans' breasts occurs no more and no less than 37 seconds into the story, as two creeps aim to have their way with Taramis. Although there's not a great deal of actual story here, \"Barbarian Queen\" moves along fairly well and clocks in at an acceptable 72 minute run time. Things never get particularly gory, with doses of the red stuff being somewhat limited. The attractive cast all look very nice in their assorted skimpy costumes. The aforementioned score is pleasing, even if the compositions from Horner are lifted - in typical Roger Corman fashion - from the earlier \"Battle Beyond the Stars\". Clarkson is an appealing heroine, and Shea does well as her equally strong friend. The studly Frank Zagarino is a decent hero. Armando Capo snarls adequately as our thoroughly evil antagonist, Arrakur. Tony Middleton is fun to watch as the torturer Zohar, in a sequence that's sure to delight viewers. Filmed on location in Argentina, this can boast some respectable production value. Six out of 10."
