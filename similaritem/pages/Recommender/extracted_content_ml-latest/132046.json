         "content": "I have to say that I quite enjoyed Tomorrowland despite its way too common mistake of being quite a bit nonsensically preachy to satisfy the current politically correct view of what is \u201cwrong\u201d with the world today. Filtering out those parts this is a quite enjoyable, visually very entertaining, family movie. If you have strong opinions about certain things then you might want to be with your kids when watching this one. Personally I consider my oldest son to be quite capable of making his own opinions and as for the two younger kinds I try to point out the pro\u2019s and con\u2019s and let them grow up to make their own mistakes.\r\n\r\nHaving that out of the way this is a visually quite wonderful movie. it is of course quite CGI enhanced but in a good way. It is a Disney movie after all so you would expect, at least I did, some \u201cartistic freedom\u201d as far as the scenery is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe story is actually a quite lovely \u201cfairy tale\u201d kind of story about a \u201cwonderland\u201d far far away. Initially it is a wee bit difficult to get a grip of what is happening since it all moves about all over the place a bit. If you can overcome that first disorientation it does indeed get somewhat sensible after a while. Having said that I mean \u201csensible\u201d in the context of not only a wild and whacky science fiction movie but in the context of a wild and wacky science fiction movie aimed at the younger part of the audience. Despite the scientific blurb thrown around in the last half of the movie do not for a minute believe that any of the script writers have more scientific knowledge than the average Hollywood script writer which is\u2026zero.\r\n\r\nTo me the enjoyment of this movie came from the childish fantasy style (it does have quite a bit of a fairly tale story over it), from the rather enjoyable cinematic effects, quite a bit of cool action and last but not least \u2026 George Clooney. Actually that is not entirely fair. George was part of it but what I really liked was the recruiting android all the way from the start. When Clooney entered the scene both him and the android pretty much stole the scene. I am afraid that the Newton girl, for a lot of the time, felt more like a \u201cplot element\u201d than a main character to me.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I quite liked the scenes in Paris as well. Sorry guys but I do live in France after all. The Eiffel Tower scenes where quite enjoyable and I do like the touch where they used Mr. Eiffel\u2019s apartment at the top of the tower as a scenery. Actually I am not sure how many people actually know that there is an apartment (now a museum) up there. The stuff about a hidden room and a hidden [naah, that would be a spoiler] beneath the tower is of course truly nonsensical.\r\n\r\nSo, bottom line, if Disney would not have gone down the line of trying to make a political statement, and I do not care what that statement was except that it was blunt, obvious and unconcealed, then this movie would have gotten another star or two. I cannot justify giving it much lower than what I did since it was, technically speaking, a quite good and entertaining movie. However, movies for children is not the medium to make a statement unless you believe that you are living in a socialist state a \u2018la the Soviet Union.",

      "synopsis": "Frank Walker (George Clooney) is talking to an unseen audience about the future when a female voice interrupts him, tell him that his wording is a touch 'bleak.' When the female asks him to think back to when he thought of the future as an optimistic place, he talks about when he went to the 1964 World's Fair in New York City as a child. Young Frank (Thomas Robinson) eagerly enters the Hall of Inventions carrying a very large duffle bag containing his invention: a jet pack he made. Though the judge David Nix (Hugh Laurie) does not show much enthusiasm for the device (which Frank admits doesn't work properly), a little girl named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) seems to think Frank's invention has potential. Outside the hall, Athena catches up with Frank. Giving him a small pin, she requests that he follow her behind a small group. The group also includes Mr Nix, and some guests of his. Putting on the pin, Frank follows the group to the \"It's a Small World\" attraction, where Frank bypasses the line and boards one of the boats by himself. During the ride, a laser scans his pin, and he's suddenly plunged down a secret chute, underneath the ride. The boat Frank is on then pulls up at a small transport station. After a disorienting ride, Frank finds himself on a foggy platform, but sees a strange flying vehicle taking off nearby, with Athena waving to him. Frank attempts to follow, but finds himself on the edge of a platform. Suddenly, construction robots arise, creating new structures, but knocking Frank down to a lower level. As his jetpack clatters to the platform, a robot nearby suddenly grabs it. Frank fights to get back his invention, but he is surprised when the huge automaton fixes it. However, Frank inadvertently falls from this platform as well, but upon igniting his jetpack, he finds himself soaring amid a gleaming white cityscape unlike anything he's ever seen before. Eventually, he sees Athena and the others, and touches down right in front of Mr Nix...who only seems mildly amused that Frank's invention can actually fly. Even so, Athena gives the young boy a reaffirming smile. Frank then becomes pessimistic again, when the female voice interrupts that he's seeming negative again. When Frank asks if the unnamed voice would like to take over telling the story, it obliges. We are then introduced to Casey Newton (Britt Robertson), who happily proclaims she's 'an optimist.' After a brief glimpse of a young Casey naming stars in the night sky, we cut to the modern day. Late one evening, Casey surreptitiously enters a Cape Canaveral, Florida NASA launch pad that is being demolished. She sabotages three construction cranes. When she returns home, her dad tells her 'the end' of the space shuttle's former launch site is inevitable. Casey still feels she's contributing something with trying to slow down the deconstruction. Unseen by Casey, a dark figure trails her from the NASA site to her home, and quietly slips a small pin into her helmet, dangling from her motorcycle handlebar. The next day, her father Eddie (Tim McGraw) laments how even though he's a NASA engineer, there's very little hope for him to do anything useful. Ever the Optimist, Casey reminds him of the metaphor of two wolves: light and hope, darkness and despair. In the end, as Eddie told Casey, the one who will win, is the one you feed. Casey goes to school, but becomes a bother in all her classes. Her teachers tell of nuclear annihilation, planetary meltdown, and governmental collapse, but Casey just wants to know one thing: \"how can we fix it?\" However, this question receives no answers. After hearing word that NASA has brought in working equipment from Orlando to continue disassembling the platform, Casey goes out to stop them, but is caught by NASA security. After her father bails her out of jail, Casey collects her things, but is surprised to find a small pin with the letter \"T\" on it. Picking it up, she is surprised when it seems to transport her to an endless field of wheat, with a futuristic city off in the distance. On the ride home, Casey attempts to show the pin to her father, but when Eddie touches it, nothing happens. Later on that evening, Casey sneaks out of the house, and bicycles to a large field. Touching the pin this time, she finds herself in the center of a dazzling futuristic city, with jetpacks and hovertrains. She also becomes enamored seeing a rocket launch station, and follows a group of space travelers...before the pin suddenly runs out of power, and she finds herself having wandered waist-deep into a lake. Waking up her little brother Nate (Pierce Gagnon), she asks him for help trying to find another pin on the Internet. Their search takes them to a website of Blast From The Past, a store in Houston, Texas. Strangely, they only have a street address, but don't list an email or phone number. Casey tells Nate to cover for her while she takes a bus to Houston to talk to the store owners. The next day, Athena sees Nate in front of their home who asks to see Casey. When Nate attempts to tell Athena that Casey is away, she claims he's lying, and asks where she \"really\" is. Arriving at Blast From The Past, Casey meets the store owners, Ursula (Kathryn Hahn), and Hugo (Keegan-Michael Key). They tell her that the pin supposedly was a key to showing a world created by some of the greatests geniuses in history, who called themselves Plus Ultra. When the two press Casey for more information on where she got the pin, her claims that she just 'found it' cause the two to get upset. Things take a turn for the strange when the two grab two actual-working laser guns, and attempt to kill her. Casey is saved when Athena appears, stopping the two in their tracks with a time-bomb (a device that stops time temporarily in a 15 foot radius). As the two get free, Casey and Athena fight them, with Athena pulling off Ursula's head, and Hugo being skewered. Both Casey and Athena rush out of the store before Hugo self-destructs, with the small girl then breaking into a car, and allowing the two of them to get away. In the car, Athena tells Casey that the two people they encountered, were Audio-Animatronic figures, and it was she (Athena) who gave Casey the pin. However, the fight has damaged Athena, and Casey panics when she realizes that the little girl is also a robot! Casey attempts to flee with Athena giving chase...but not before a truck slams into the small robot; Casey uses the opportunity to take the truck, but Athena quickly recovers, and chases after Casey, managing to catch up to her' Athena claims she is from the place Casey saw when she touched the pin (which happened to be her last one.), but it may not be there much longer. After a small discussion, Casey is willing to accept that Athena will not harm her. Athena wishes them to drive to Pittsfield, New York, to meet a man named Frank Walker. Back in Houston, Police are combing through the wreckage of the store, when a black van pulls up, and several people get out, led by a smiling man who calls himself Dave Clark (Matthew MacCaull). When one of the officers finds the charred remains of Ursula's head, Dave pulls out a device that disintegrates the nearby officers. Once they are done away with, he informs the other members of his party to contact Governor Nix. Eventually, driving all-night wears Casey out, and she relinquishes the driving duties to Athena...only to awaken on the side of a road, with Athena driving away! Seeing a mailbox nearby with the name \"Walker\" on it, she ignores the no trespassing sign and comes onto the property. She soon encounters a barking dog, but upon seeing it leaving no paw prints in the dirt, finds that it is simply a realistic hologram. Going to the front door, a man on the other side tells Casey to leave. When she demands to be taken to the place the pin showed, a concussive blast sends her flying backward, and Frank emerges. While she pleads to be taken to the place she saw, Frank tells her it doesn't actually exist. What she saw was a 'commercial' for this place, and they threw him out, and sealed off all ways to get back in. Frank once again tells Casey to leave, but she refuses to. As day turns to night, Casey notices a number of cables leading from the main house, and finds they are all attached to an array of antennas and satellite dishes. Setting a nearby tractor on fire, Casey gets Frank to leave the house, and get inside. Frank manages to put out the fire, but Casey refuses to let him back in until he takes her where she wants to go. Exploring the house, she finds some futuristic-looking devices, and a room showing numerous world and political turmoil, along with a countdown clock, and a 'probability' detector. Frank manages to get back in the house, and attempts to get Casey to leave once again, but she demands to know what she has just been witness to. When Frank realizes she won't just leave, he posits a question: \"What if I could tell you the exact day you would die?\" Casey claims she'd naturally want to know, but then if she did find out, she wouldn't believe it, and would try to find some way to change the future. Suddenly, the monitors behind her all flicker, and the probability numbers drop by the smallest percentage...but it's still enough to make Frank take notice. Suddenly, sensors indicate intruders, and a black van with dark-suited figures is seen. Frank attempts to fortify his house, but the intruders break in, revealing they are audio-animatronic figures. Frank manages to grab some things and stuff them in a bag, before he and Casey get into a bathtub, which rockets them out of the house as the former inventor self-destructs his birthplace. The tub lands in a nearby pond, and Casey and Frank emerge to find Athena in a truck nearby. The group begins to drive away from the house, but Frank quickly gets into a small argument with Athena. Athena ends up taking them to a television station, hoping Frank can take them to \"The Spectacle.\" Frank at first refuses, but finally relents, willing to accompany them. Leading them into a utility shack, he reveals a secret underground entrance, wherein lies a teleportation machine. As he covers Casey's eyes and ears as part of the teleportation procedure, Frank asks why Athena chose someone like Casey. \"Because she hasn't given up,\" the small automaton replies. In a matter of moments, the three are transported to their new location: atop the Eiffel Tower, in Paris, France. After subduing a guard, the group find their way into a small room, wherein are figures of Thomas Edison, Gustave Eiffel, Jules Verne, and Nicola Tesla. Frank claims that the Eiffel tower functions as an antenna, and a secret gateway the men made, as an emergency entrance to reach their secret city. Frank reveals an Edison Tube, that when put on a phonograph, opens a secret entrance. As the group watches, the tower splits in two, becoming a gantry, and a rocketship emerges from a compartment beneath the ground. Getting into the rocket, the three find French robots also attempting to stop them. However, the rocket blasts off before they can get to the three. After breaking free of Earth's gravity, the main compartment of the rocket flips around, and hurtles back towards Earth, breaking through into another dimension. The three emerge near the rocket area that Casey saw in the commercial, only it's desolate and deserted. Seeing a group of vehicles approach, Frank hands Athena a small device: a 1-kiloton bomb the size of a small ball, that she hides in a compartment inside herself. Frank claims they may need it for leverage. As the group watches, a hover train arrives, and Governor Nix emerges, looking just as he did when Frank first met him. Nix exchanges some short 'pleasantries' with Frank and Athena, and is then introduced to Casey. It is here that Frank explains about the probability blip he saw, feeling she can change things. The group then heads to a central tower, with a giant sphere nearby, sending energy into it. A platform transports the group up, with tachyons bathing the group, showing glimpses of things several moments in the future. As the platform rises into the sphere, a globe rises up on a pedestal in the center of the room. Frank shows Casey that it can take people in and out of places, and go backwards and forwards in time, showing people the Earth. Casey tests it out, and Nix is surprised how quickly she adapts to using it. Zeroing in on the NASA landing platform, Casey pushes into the future, but is surprised when the image becomes fuzzy. Pushing forward, she sees fire and smoke. Going over the globe, she sees other things: cities being destroyed, tornadoes and freak thunderstorms, before seeing her family's home underwater. Frank claims that what they see is said to be coming in a month's time or less. Casey is angered as to why Nix hasn't told anyone on Earth about what will happen, but Nix shows no reason to be concerned: what will happen will happen on Earth. The city will survive. When this prompts Casey to ask why Nix doesn't allow those on Earth to come to the city, he counters that there is too great of a risk for humans to destroy it, just like the Earth. Casey then shows her optimism by refusing to give in to what the machine has shown them, when suddenly, the panoramic view brightens, and the environment looks normal. Frank eagerly tells Nix that he has witnessed what he was talking about, but the Governor taps Frank with a device, knocking him out. Frank awakens in a confined room, with Athena and Casey nearby. Athena tells Frank he is once again to be banished, with Casey upset that Frank didn't tell her about the impending end of the world. Frank tells Case that he knows she's 'special,' but her optimism seems to have dried up. Feeling lied to that the pin seemed broadcast into her mind a vision of a bright future...she suddenly comes to a startling conclusion. Frank's antennas and dishes were grabbing feeds of what the device was broadcasting. But what if it the machine isn't just predicting the future...it is causing people to give in to these visions, and just accept what will happen: a self-fulfilling prophecy doomsday device. The three are brought before Nix, who has decided to banish them to a deserted island, via a portal. Frank attempts to tell Nix about what they found out, but he claims that shutting down the sphere won't make any difference. Casey is still upset that given everything they've seen, little glimmers of hope, this futurist can't seem to see reason, before Frank explains that the sphere was Nix's idea (of which Frank helped to assemble it). Nix's idea was reasonable: broadcast a future in which humanity would be galvanized to do something about what they believed would happen...but instead, all the visions did was make people accept what they saw, and give in. They repackaged what they saw into media, and seemed to care only for the here-and-now, never willing to consider what their actions could mean for the future. The three are about to be put through the portal, when Frank activates the sphere's lift via the controls on Nix's watch. As the two struggle, Frank tells Athena to use the 1-kiloton device to blow up the sphere. However, Nix activates two robots, and Athena is detained. Tossing the device to Casey, she climbs onto the platform. She manages to arm the device, but during Frank's struggle, Nix manages to keep the platform from ascending. With the device armed, and no way up, Casey hurls the device through the portal, with Athena shutting it just before it explodes. However, the blast loosens a piece of architecture, and it crashes down on Nix's leg, pinning him to the ground. Suddenly, Athena sees Nix shoot Frank with a laser gun...only to see it was a tachyon glimpse of the future. Seeing the real thing unfold before her, she rushes into the line of fire, and takes the blast. Frank attempts to get Athena to a repair station, but she tells him she can't be repaired. As she begins to shut down, Athena reveals to Frank glimpses of her memory, via logs: one tells of how she fears what will happen when he finds out she isn't human, but wishes to support him, as it seems she helps spur on his creativity. - another tells how she may be having emotions towards him, but has decided not to report this. the final transmission, shows the year 1984, in which Frank was exiled from Tomorrowland, blaming Athena for what happened. Athena explains that she can still be of use to Frank: she has a self-destruct device within her, and she can be used to destroy the sphere. Using a jet pack, Frank ascends above the city with his former friend and confidante. As she shuts down, Frank drops her into the sphere. Her self-destruct mechanism sends the sphere crashing to the ground, and crushing Governor Nix. Once back on the ground, Casey and Frank wonder what to do next. It is soon decided there is only one thing to do: become proactive! Casey opens the portal near her home, and invites her father and brother into Tomorrowland. Frank decides to reopen the recruitment program, turning on the pin-making machines, and building a number of new child-looking recruiters. We soon find that this is who Casey and Frank have been talking to the whole time: the new recruiters (like Athena). Each one is given their own pin-case, with a mission to find Dreamers, those that will help build a newer, and better Tomorrow. The final images show a number of people finding the \"T\" pins. As they each touch them, we then see dozens of people popping up in the vast wheat field, eyes drawn towards the spires of Tomorrowland. one tells of how she fears what will happen when he finds out she isn't human, but wishes to support him, as it seems she helps spur on his creativity. - another tells how she may be having emotions towards him, but has decided not to report this. the final transmission, shows the year 1984, in which Frank was exiled from Tomorrowland, blaming Athena for what happened.",

         "I very rarely write reviews for movies, but after watching Tomorrowland I've never seen a movie that's been so unfairly maligned by negative reviews,especially considering that this movie was an absolute joy from beginning to end. After watching it, and reading truly horrible, reviews I'm starting to think that somebody hired a few live bodies to slate this movie for their own specific reasons. The script, actors and directors captured the feeling of endless possibilities perfectly. The FX were fantastic, there were no lulls in the plot, George Clooney did his thing perfectly, the child actors were incredible, and there were just enough twists and turns to maintain the pace. Please, please watch this movie and make your own mind up - the negative reviews almost put me off, but I'm so glad I actually took the chance. Actually there's one proviso here - and is probably something consistent with most of the negative reviews: If you lack imagination, or the yearning for a better world, then you'll hate this movie. Or you want to raise kids who aspire to be nothing more than reality TV actors. Or if you're a reality TV actor. Or your kids can't read or write because you don't think it's important. Or if you think science is dumb. Or if you can't embrace hope. As for me...I loved it. I'll be watching it again and again :-)One of the best movies of 2015, and now on my \"favourite movie\" list.",
         "This film deserved so much more than what it got, both critically and commercially, when it debuted back in May, where unfortunately it ended up becoming one of the year's biggest box-office bombs. From the mind of one of today's greatest directors, Brad Bird, the same great filmmaker that gave us some of the best animated films of all-time like 'The Iron Giant' and 'The Incredibles' and the best 'Mission Impossible' film to date in 'Ghost Protocol', 'Tomorrowland' is an inspiring original story that above all promotes the two things that have been lacking in today's cynical society; hope and the promise of a bright future. Some have accused this film of being preachy for promoting these exact morals. But if you ask me, that just makes this film even stronger as a result in how it boldly goes against the cynical mindset that you see a lot of nowadays in favor of an optimistic vision of a better tomorrow. Bird and co-writer Damon Lindelof make the right decision to not over-rely too much on the world of Tomorrowland. This film may be centered around a fantastic utopia where anything is possible but it's more about the journey to Tomorrowland than the place itself and the build-up leading into the film's finale is second to none. Ultimately though it was the finale of the film that made it such a polarizing flick amongst critics. But contrary to popular opinion, I thought it was suitable for what the story demanded. In a year where characters like Furiosa are being regarded as some of the greatest film characters of their time, this film features two of the best female leads of the year, played perfectly by Britt Robertson and Raffey Cassidy, respectively. As lead Casey, Robertson perfectly conveys the character's optimistic outlook without coming off as annoying while Cassidy shines in the role of the totally bad-ass robot Athena. George Clooney is also excellent in the role of an inventor named Frank who, compared to Casey, is much more pessimistic about the future but gradually regains his faith over the course of the film. Don't let this film become one of those forgotten box-office bombs just because it dared to critique the cynicism of today's society. With brilliant performances and visuals and messages that resonate more than ever nowadays, 'Tomorrowland' is easily the most underrated film of 2015 and another masterpiece from director Brad Bird.",
         "This movie really took a person's imagination to a whole new level. The story was interesting, and keeps a person engaged with what is happening. It was cool to see the power of imagination and how a simple thought could become something much bigger. Frank Walker, played by George Clooney, was recognized by his limitless imaginative capability. It was going to one day change the world as it is. He was able to do just that. Walker was a genius scientist who made a certain discovery about Tomorrowland that would hold the key to changing the world. With the help from Casey Newton, played by Britt Robertson, Walker was able to travel to the city and unravel what he had discovered so long ago. This movie has a simple story, and it is ideal for those with a creative and innovative imagination.",
         "I can't believe the bad reviews. I also can't believe that nobody understood what they accomplished with this film. It's Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged! They managed to take that book and bring it up to date while making it accessible to all ages. That is a fantastic feat in and of itself. To also make it really entertaining is extraordinary. Cerebral and action packed, it holds the attention of the young right to the end. And the end? The film was the pin that showed the audience what could be if only we don't give up and just make things better. Atlas Shrugged and then asked for help. Everybody should see this film. Now. Oh, ignore the comments about continuity. Does it really matter? Artistic licence anyone? Right my review is over but I have to keep writing because it won't post unless I fill the minimum line count.",
         "I went and saw this with an open mind because of the mixed response, and I must say I had a blast. The story is unique, creative and quite compelling. It is original science fiction which we do not get too often. The film is inspired by the Disney park, but at the same time, it's more of it's own thing. It is well acted and the characters are quite likable and believable. Frank Walker is interesting, entertaining and has a sense of humor. Casey is also an interesting character. I think George Clooney and Britt Robertson portrayed their leading roles very well. The film is also quite funny at times. During this film, I think I may have laughed more than I usually do at the movies, which is saying something. I think Brad Bird did a very goo job directing. The visuals are stunning and the special effects, while mostly CGI, are impressive. The action scenes are neat and intense. There is not a single moment where I was bored with the film. It also pays a nice homage to the Sci-fi genre. The one problem I had with this film is that I was expecting a little more of the \"Tomorrowland\" place and that the story needed a little more work. Overall, this was a great film and I highly recommend it to fans of science fiction. Plus, I think it totally puts \"The Haunted Mansion\" (2003) to shame. In the end, \"Tomorowland\" may not fully realize it's potential, but it should be satisfying as a fun and intriguing Disney family sci-fi/adventure comedy thrill ride.",
         "I think this movie was fantastic. You should know what you are watching and who is the target audience and have the right mindset. For example if you are watching any of the Aliens you are looking for a bit of horror, thrill and some brutality; and if you are watching Avatar you are looking a hardcore mystery and thrill. I think Brad Bird did an amazing job for its target audience. When I watched it I was not expecting brutality, hardcore action or deep mystery, I was expecting good quality soft Sci-Fi. I think it did great to keep me extremely interested throughout the movie and the message of the film and its delivery was beautiful. Talking to and reading the reviews of those who didn't like it, I think they were expecting a Sci-Fi like Aliens, or Terminator which is like eating Coffee and Cookies for lunch! You'll not enjoy it because you have the wrong expectations! It's the problem of the consumer not the product. So the bottom line is, if you are looking for a beautiful soft inspirational Sci-Fi with an amazing direction that you can watch with your kids and teenagers and re-energize the dreamer in you, go for it! :)",
         "This movie is misunderstood, I'm writing my first review with the hope to increase understanding and appreciation of it. Lose your expectations and watch it as it is, an adventure. Think about the things you see, analyze them. Don't expect to be on the edge of your seat all the time from exciting action, it takes a back seat after the beginning.. which the trailer seems to mostly contain and make a false picture of the film. My opinion.. I try and keep this spoiler free. While perhaps expecting a little more awe scenes, action and insight into the \"tomorrowland\" society the movie has some very nice scenes. 2/3 into the film it somehow got a bit boring.. but it gets better. Could perhaps have been cut on a place or too, but the scenes were visually pleasing instead. A few confusing aspects here and there like the transition at the end, but who cares? No one has seemed to bother analyzing the philosophical aspects of pre-determination, alternate realities and concepts like our consciousness creating our reality as an reflection of our collective state of mind. The message is a fine one and something to think about our outlook on life. Does all the negativity really serve us? What's the content of news? Only negative stories. Do they encourage you to go out and make a difference or make you depressed and go on with business as usual it is all going to h*ll anyways? But it sells and is a money making mechanism.. It is a bit humorous the extent the level of fear the society in the movie are in and project unto the children and society, connections to our western society can be made too. If you notice these things you will appreciate the hints at secret societies and connections to the \"Club 33\" in Disneyland too and other goodies like the rivalry between Nikola Tesla and Edison. Nothing too profound or divulging from my understanding but it's there too, Tesla is an under appreciated figure in our history who deserves a lot more recognition. These are the things I brought with me from this movie, and I'm a sucker for scifi, which was what initially attracted me to the film, but it turned out to just be eye candy to boot :) not the main thing about the film.",
         "I looked forward to this movie since seeing the trailers. The stunning visual of Britt Roberts transported to an other worldly place, then George Clooney asking \"do you want to go?\". Seriously? Heck yea! Maybe I'm a hopeless romantic, but I enjoy stories that hold out the promise of adventure mixed with hope and some genuine magic. I was not disappointed. Tomorrowland hit all the right points with me--adventure, mystery, characters to love and root for, surprise story twists, laugh out loud moments, and, the best magic of all, hope. Saw it twice, second time with grand kids. I will be adding Tomorrowland to my Disney collection.",
         "A bit uneven and too long (It takes the movie about 30 minutes to really kick into gear). Otherwise I enjoyed the plot of slowly figuring out what is Tomorrowland and what's the purpose behind it all. So it's not a perfect film but a long way from the failure it's made out to be. Brad Bird doesn't disappoint. I have read quite a lot of negative comments about this movie and even its message and I find that to be slightly odd. From saying science should only concentrate on inventions instead of research to being annoyingly preachy. God forbid if a movie has a message these days and despite it having an agenda I thought the movie was fun and entertaining. I personally found the message of the movie to be pro-science and to fight the cynicism and apathy that makes it seem it's impossible to save the world from the direction we're going in. I usually feel there's no hope for the human race but I like to see movies that try to convince me otherwise and try to keep the small glimmer of hope alive.",
         "The creativity and imagination that went into this movie is stunning. A great message about how positive and forward thinking can influence our futures and the futures of generations to come. The movie brought me back to my younger days when my imagination would make exciting dreams and made me think that anything was possible. The characters were great and the scenery and colours were spectacular. I have never written a review before on this site, but after watching this movie I was inspired and felt impelled to give my comments, if only to encourage others to watch it. I remember watching Star Trek as a child and how imaginative it was with all the communication gadgets, most of which actually exist today. I wonder if many of the items seen in this movie will one day become reality as well, perhaps not in my lifetime, but with the advancement of technology and the imaginations of the creative people at Disney, who knows! All I know is that I don't agree with the critical reviews and will always form my own opinion.",
         "I'll keep this relatively short. I'm a 60 year old, very hard to please Brit. This film, pleased me very much indeed. Hence, the 9 out of 10 score. Those who marked this film down, really do require a reality check. I'm not usually given to writing film reviews, but on seeing this film's current low rating - I felt compelled to write something positive, in its favour. The acting and special effects alone, stand on their own. The film, may well be 105 minutes long, but it's 105 of the best spent minutes I've had, this millennium. I won't delve into the film's storyline, as that has been adequately explained by others. If you want to be engagingly captivated, in a futuristic, make-believe World - where anything seems possible - then this is the film for you. I for one, would love to escape the current mess of a World we live in - to experience the alternative dimension, on offer, in Tomorrowland: A World Beyond",
         "So, before I get to the movie, a word about some of the negative reviews here. Wow, there are so many! I'm not sure if they saw the same movie as I did, or if they are all just devoid of a sense of wonder and fun, but there are an awful lot of people that really disliked this movie. Of course, when you read their \"arguments\" (I'll be generous and call them that), you realize that most of their discontent stems from the fact that they thought the movie was going to be something else entirely. I'm one of the most cynical and jaded moviegoers going and I'm always ready to rip a new celluloid butthole in any film that deserves it, but this film does not warrant some of the comments here. When I see people complaining this movie is too violent, or that it isn't a family movie, or any of the number of bemusing complaints, I wonder if they aren't exactly the kind of people that this movie warns its viewers about. Namely, those so obsessed with negativity, that they can't accept anything that is fun. This movie surprised me, because I had heard bad things about it and it was, in part, penned by Damon Lindelof, whose work it is fair to say I find by turns amusing (not in a good way) and irritating. I'm not sure how much of the story is down to him, but regardless, this counts as one of his better efforts in my book. So what will you get when you sit down to watch this movie? You'll get two hours or so of utterly harmless fun, aimed primarily at kids, but with enough more adult themes in it to entertain the adults among us. That said, it isn't at all offensive, or violent, and it isn't boring. It moves along at a decent pace. There are slower moments in it, but the action scenes move along briskly when they appear, and they appear quite often. Any violence on display at all is aimed squarely at robots. There is only one scene where I exclaimed out loud in surprise, because I wasn't expecting it at all, and that was when the little girl robot gets hit by a pickup truck out of nowhere. It's a bit of a shock, to be honest, but she is quickly shown to be unharmed by the incident. However, it might frighten some younger children for a moment, so be warned. I think a lot of the negativity this movie has received is down to the fact that at one point, the bad guy of the film (Hugh Laurie) spells out just how horrible people are and that their impending doom is entirely down to their own fault. There is a little speech that essentially blames people for their own lack of foresight and bone-idleness, which has led them to the brink of destruction. Now, I normally might find this sort of thing preachy and condescending, but it fits well in the context of the movie. However, some people, I think, aren't able to have fun poked at them and seem to have taken an unnecessary amount of offence at this, and taken it out on the movie as a whole. Despite this darker tone, the movie as a whole paints a hopeful vision, showing us that we can change our future if we really want to. The ending is a little cheesy, but it is a good kind of cheese, with the message that it is never too late to make a change. Overall, the movie is just a fun flick for kids and their parents. Older teens might be bored a little, but younger kids will love it. It isn't meant to be taken too seriously, but just enjoyed for what it is. Oh and for the person that suggested the movie was unsuitable for any child under fourteen, your kids have my sympathies. Oh my God! Their lives must be filled with so much cotton wool padding that they are perpetually on the verge of smothering to death. Good job! SUMMARY: Way more fun than its rating would have you believe. Generally harmless entertainment of a family nature. Don't take the negativity seriously, because the movie never takes itself seriously. Its fun, that's all there is to it.",
         "Who would have thought that one of the most imaginative films of the last five years would be a film targeted at children? Tomorrowland was a pleasant surprise. There were a ton of really amazing scenes and a grand sense of scale. The cast is magnificent. George Clooney is great as always. However, it must be mentioned that Raffey Cassidy almost steals the show. She is definitely one to watch and as long as she avoids the pitfalls that go with fame, she is pretty much guaranteed a very bright future in the acting business. The story is compelling and has a good message -- without sounding preachy. Lots of great classic science fiction homages in here, plus plenty of very cool modern ideas. It was great to see three generations of future aesthetic in the same film. In general, the pacing is pretty good. There are a few parts where it drags a bit. It makes up for it in spades in the last half of the film. Editing was expertly done with plenty of quick reaction cuts between actors to thread things together neatly. As usual, Disney's shot choices are very good (very textbook actually) and the score suits the film nicely. Be sure to treat the kid(s) in your life (your children, nieces, nephews) and or course, yourself to this movie. It's one of the few modern family films that's actually genuinely enjoyable for all ages. Plus, you'll get to see some of Santiago Calatrava's more extravagant architecture.",
         "Don't listen to the haters giving this movie ones and twos, because this movie is phenomenal! This was my favorite Disney movie\u0085 before Inside Out came out (then it became my number two favorite). The characters are nice and fun with just enough screen time and character development to make them likable. The story: Brad Bird's GREATEST PREMISE since a Superhero family! The world is going to end because someone has implanted that idea into everyone's heads. So it is up to a girl with a great imagination and determination to save it. But the twist is the bad guy in this movie isn't George Clooney for making the device, or the Audio-Animatronic girl, or even Hugh Laurie. It's US. Because we didn't know any better, we didn't try to fight the idea of the end of the world. So, in a way, WE are the reason that this movie exists. I guess the only reason people hate on this movie is because of the continuity errors and the fact that they are the bad guys. Speaking of, this movie does have it's faults, but who cares when you have a great story and characters AND amazing special effects. And, yeah, the effects in this movie are beyond amazing. When I saw Tomorrowland for the first time, and the rocket in the Eiffel Tower, I was blown away! I saw the trailers and the effects made me gravitate towards this movie! And the trailer is probably another reason why people don't like this movie. The trailer made it look like an early preview for Star Wars 7. I was also expecting that, but when I saw the actual movie, the trailer didn't matter. So what if you didn't get a dumb action sci-Fi flick. You have a new original idea acted well, directed well, written well, and made at the right time that this movie should have been a hit! Tomorrowland: Disney's dream on the big screen, and I LOVE IT.",
         "I will try to be simple: The good: Direction, original story, performance (especially the two young actresses), FX. A real jewel, and not only without a glitch, but with funny moments and action at every minute, or even, some of them, very touching. The bad: ... It's supposed to need to write something? OK: nothing at all. The worst: All the bad appreciation of critics which really have no good taste for art. A lot of people does not understand that the movie is not just about Tomorrowland, but about a journey inside the heart and will of the people... and with this, as if that was a small achievement, an odyssey. If you want to see a good exponent of the 7th art, don't hesitate to see this movie. If not, just listen some critics. ;) Additional comments: Some people say the movie has technical failures, but believe me, there are none, and the reason is because this movie returns to the most pure essence of Sci-Fi. Maybe some people does not liked because it touch sensible fibers about a very common and well known message, or maybe because they believe that it was only to promote a Disney attraction, but even if that was true, doesn't diminish the quality of the movie. A little childish, OK, the movie was intended for all the audience, and this is not a bad thing, in fact, is an incredible and amazing way about how to show the essence of something really beautiful. Finally, I see some comments about an over-acted Britt Robertson, but if you have seen some of her works before, maybe you can see that the little histrionism that she injected in her character is very intentional, and then you will see the talent of this great actress. \"In a world where values, commitment, common sense, courage, curiosity, and thinking capacity are weakening, this movie is a beacon of hope for children... and adults too\".",
         "The fact that this movie gets as many bad reviews and ratings as it does absolutely astonishes me, I'm very critical when it comes to movies with a \"environmental message\" like this, but I had no problem with it, it was delivered in a fun laid-back tone, and Clooney's performance was very sarcastic and cynical, I loved this movie for that reason. I don't watch Clooney often, but I'm happy he was in this. It simply tells a great story revealing \"secrets\" of the great minds of previous generations, and gives us plenty of back story and interesting laws that apply to \"Tomorrowland\" 5/7 would watch again.",
         "I mean, don't be surprised. Yes, Tomorrowland is a science fiction adventure of the highest grade, an unpredictable thrill ride of a movie, full of plot twists, jaw-dropping imagery, hauntingly beautiful music, and brilliant acting by major star power. Not to mention the great direction and editing that does not leave a spare second throughout its two hour length. Disney, ILM and Pixar. Lindelof and Bird. Clooney and Laurie, Robertson and Cassidy. Wood and Murch. Giacchino. Rule-breaking and ingenious, inspiring and fresh, this is a top notch entertainment from a top notch talent. But it is more than all that. It is also a fable, a tale of two wolves. It makes its moral pretty clear. The thing is, people a fable is addressed to usually do not find it funny or cute. I wonder how many 'dumb', 'disappointing', 'preachy', 'pointless', 'boring', 'leftist propaganda', 'I fell asleep right when the Grasshopper...' Aesop was getting in his time. That is why Tomorrowland was a very brave thing to do. It takes guts to make a movie where everything from start to finish very smartly, very carefully, very distinctly adds up to the core message 'negativity is a failure' -- and to release it in a world full of negative people. Wow. I get why they hate it. I can also see why Brad Bird skipped Star Wars to make it. Personally, I think it was worth it. Thanks, Brad!",
         "Sorry that this review is so late in the day. I have only just recently got around to seeing Tomorrowland. All the acting performances in this movie are wonderful and the humour is first rate. The soundtrack too is especially good. A great soundtrack improves a story enormously. I decided to turn on the subtitle channel on the DVD to follow all the dialogue and this also helps on the first viewing to follow the narrative better. I am supposed to type out a minimum of 10 lines according to the rules but to do this I would have to put some spoilers in and so therefore I am going to try and waffle for as long as possible to fill out because I do not wish to spoil anyone else's enjoyment of Tomorrowland.",
         "I watched the trailer for this and it seemed like way to many things were happening in this movie. This meant that when i had the time to sit down and relax to watch it, i changed my mind and watched Maze Runner - Scorch Trials instead. This is a mistake that should not be made as that was so bad i can barely describe it. Anyways i decided i would watch it even though the trailer was a mess, and what a pleasant surprise. It was not messy in any way and it got me hooked from very early on. It has amazing visuals, great casting and a very meaningful story. Rafael Cassidy (Athena) did an amazing job. At such a young age to pull off such a performance is rarely seen, and given the right chances she could be worth to follow through her career. Clooney is good but not spectacular as his character is not great in the beginning. He catches up though. Britt Robertson (Casey) also does great and is another one to watch in the future. The story is actually very timely and is something i reflected on after watching the movie. It heads off with some background story before nicely introducing us to the characters. I was hooked all the way as we follow Casey around though thick and thin. Great movie and a bit low rated in my opinion. I would place it at 7.5 and therefore i give it the benefit of the limits with an 8.",
         "Brad Bird has yet to let me down, this movie has divided audiences but the division is pretty much down to those who share the quality of imagination and creativity as opposed to those who have nurtured their cynicism to the point of interpreting everything as a negative. That basically is what this film is about in a nutshell, its made to inspire hope from the creative among us who are not living our potential due largely to the multitude of negativity, conflict and selfishness the human race seem to have become comfortable in wallowing in. If this film had been released 20 years ago, I might have never given up my previous profession of drawing comics for a living. This is the first movie that's ever made me reflect on my choices in life and feel ashamed that I \"fed the wrong wolf\" so to speak. If you have kids then take them to see this movie, inspire them to dream, create and be positive now more than ever. Ignore the critics and the negative reviews, this movie is nothing short of superb family fun with a message more important today than any film you'll probably ever see again. Brad Bird and Michael Garaccchino are the new Steven Spielberg and John Williams, the music in this film is outstanding and will stay with you long after you leave the theatre. This movie has earned a very special place in my heart and up there with Mad Max Fury Road for best movies of the year so far.",
         "I went into this with somewhat low expectations, do to the poor box office. I was more than pleasantly surprised. It was visually amazing. The cinematography was so well done. A perfect combination of CGI and interesting set locations. Acting and casting was superb. Britt Robertson is one of the most compelling young actresses. She has brought her A game to the big screen. If you can get around the global warming nonsense that creeps into almost every film these days, Sort of like the cold war and Nuclear proliferation were in all of the films of the 60's and 70's., the plot is actually clever. I really enjoyed this picture and wish I had seen it in 3d. I think it may have a cult following in the future",
         "Please watch this movie, it has been given bad reviews unfairly, it warns people about our dying world but it does it in an entertaining way. When the world is doomed, what do you do? You'd try to alert people so they could take action to prevent the death of the world from happening, right? And how would you do it? With news stories? Scientific data? Good luck. Most people would rather turn a blind eye to any environmental issues and just watch Walking Dead reruns to get their minds off it. But what if there was a movie that was family friendly, had a great cast, and even had the Disney name attached to it? What if Hugh Laurie had a remarkable and compelling speech which tried to get the message out to as many people as possible to get their acts together? To save civilization, the movie would show it's collapse. But how do you think this movie was received? The ticket sales were lackluster, because everyone would rather watch the same kind of movie they'd seen a hundred times before. People didn't care to see something original, they wrote it off BECAUSE it was original! Critics, internet reviewers, right-wing conservatives, all defecated upon this movie, and told people it was a waste of time. Meanwhile, the movie was actually a hidden gem. An entertaining film with a powerful message, but nobody cared to see it! And because nobody wanted to watch it, the message went unheard by so many. In every moment, there is the possibility of a better future, where people get off their lazy asses and actually take action to improve something! Learning a new skill, planting trees to make the air cleaner, spending time with their families, inventing new technology! But people would rather resign themselves to a boring future where they never do anything of value for one reason: Because it's easier. The future where we've solved world hunger, ended prejudice, and achieved world peace is hard. Achievable, but hard. And the future where everyone is a lazy glutton that does nothing but eat pizza and watch TV all day is easy. So yes. We saw there was a problem, and we tried to warn people. But they just ignored this warning like all the others. Why? Because they want to be lazy. They gave up. And it's not the movie's fault if it's not striking a cord with you, it's yours.",
         "Aside from a horribly rushed plot, the irritating know-it-all unnatural teenage genius who doesn't ever say anything smart or what would at least sound like her own thoughts, aside from the rape of Isaac Asimov's story - as if someone had read just the beginning and the end of it without getting the message - as a Ukrainian, I am highly offended that the movie had used the actual footage from the mass protests which took place in Kiev in 2014. Many people had died that day at the Independence Square in Kiev, defending their freedom of assembly and democracy in Ukraine. Many police officers who had been thrown by the illegitimate government to battle their own people at the streets had fallen that day too. Our country is still torn because of the tragic events of 2013/2014, the community is an open wound. When I have seen these events crammed into a sappy disaster montage, I was not only shocked, I almost felt like I have had a flashback to a year before, which had left me with a sour taste for the rest of the movie. And then the creators of this schlock have the nerve to tell us that the reason for all human violence is a sci-fi techno babble antennae, that \"projects bad vibes\"?! This movie is heinous.",
         "This is one of the best of the best from Disney. It does the job. It delivers what ALL ART is supposed to be about. This is why Disney is what it is, and why this movie is a 10 out of 10. This movie is a beautiful beam of light in this world. I can't recommend it enough. It has love, hope, optimism, science, wisdom and forward thinking. I absolutely loved it. I have enjoyed every second of it. This movie also came in a perfect time, it is very up lifting. Life becomes what WE think of it. Let's think of a wonderful future. Let's build it together. BE the change you wish to see in the world. BE the change you wish to see in the world. BE the change you wish to see in the world. Think of a wonderful future. Let's build it together."
