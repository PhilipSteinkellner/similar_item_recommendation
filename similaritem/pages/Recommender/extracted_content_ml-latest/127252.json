         "This film is something like a medieval crime thriller set in Norway around the mid 14th century. A curious choice for a setting, and refreshingly new when everything else from that period seems to be about rampant vikings. The film starts out well, but you quickly realise that this film is somewhat amateurish in its execution, there's a clear absence of an interesting story. Large parts of the film have expositional voice-over spoon-feeding the audience the plot, the other parts we're left to wonder if we really care about any of the characters at all. The protagonist is a lawman back from Paris trying to clear his brother's name. The plot here, really, should be very easy, yet the director chooses to go about it in such a confusing way. We get no backdrop to the two brothers' relationship, the woman that drove them apart, all these things come halfway into the film as an afterthought. The result is that he runs around large parts of the film with this confused look on his face that looks straight out of drama school. Random bodies turn up here and there, you're wondering if this will turn into Troll Hunter 2 at some point, but sadly no, the screenwriter has decided that the story of the futile investigation hunt is such an emotional powerful story that it needs to be told to the letter. There's a cast of strange and underwritten characters who make no sense. A scrawny Scotsman with a contemporary haircut who keeps shouting out for whiskey all the time, a Finnish heathen grandpa, a Danish enforcer and others who you have no reason to like or understand why they're trumping about in the mud of that god-forsaken village. There's a couple of very good actors who make an appearance, but the material they're working on is not enough to establish a connection with the audience, or indeed between each other. The music and directing is just trying to hard to make us feel something like we're watching a big, dramatic blockbuster. We're not. This is a very low-budget film thats trying too hard to feel like the next medieval epic. Action sequences are awkwardly filmed and choreographed. Certain props and effects looks like they were bought new at the local hardware shop the day of filming. Some of the language is strangely modern. There's some great shots of landscapes and cinematography in the film - but the pretty gloss cannot redeem this shambolic mess.",
         "First let me give my condolences to the families and friends of the two casualties of this movie. Daniel Henriksbø and Mats Bjarg. OK. Skumringslandet isn't a horrible movie, but there are some problems. I think it looks very good. Great atmosphere. Nice scenery. It must be at least partly because of Pål Sterud! I'm sure of it. Someone promote that dude! Skumringslandet has some sweet looking visuals, and it looks authentic. It made me think about how it must have been living in those times. Good stuff. Unfortunately the direction isn't the best. It jumps here and there and lacks the proper build up in several scenes. The main actor isn't as good an actor as he should be either, which is kind of a shame. He has this stare, like a lot. You just don't really feel for the guy. Sverre Anker Ousdal although not bad, unfortunately quite can't handle his dialect, also a shame. The highlight acting-wise is Kim Bodnia. He's solid. Ewen Bremner is also fun. So, all in all not too shabby, but it won't go down as a classic. That Pål Sterud, though. Good job!",
         "What a sorry piece of film this was. Adjusted for a small budget yes, but come on - the creative forces in production and acting were so weak. The story is lame and confusing and the acting sucks. That Goes for everyone except Kim Bodnia. Sad to see such a good actor riding out his career by catching crappy gigs in low budget productions. The setting for this movie - 12th Century Norway, recently christened by the sword - presents lots of opportunities for a good movie on a small budget. Was this achieved? No. Were dialogues and acting at times awkward? Yes. Did you get fed up of Ansgar before even seeing him? Indeed If, by curiosity you decide to watch this movie - they the Only way to enjoy the film is to turn it into a drinking game. Every time the name Ansgar is spoken - your Choice of liquid comes bottom up! Raise the stakes by shotting Absinthe every time the protagonist looks perplexed and stupid while uttering his brothers name. Was this review helpful to you? Good, thank you!"
