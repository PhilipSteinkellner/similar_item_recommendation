         "Twins separated at birth meet again blah blah But it's fun to watch and you get to see Jackie Chan's hilariously imaginative fight scenes! With a couple of babes thrown in and the inadvertent swapping of partners from one twin to the other, you can but tempt to imagine the glorious fun that results. This is Jackie at his silly best, a dignified world-famous conductor in one role whilst a bumbling bad-ass mechanic in the other, we get to see how versatile, if unique, an actor he is. For much of the film, both twins keep meddling in each other's lives causing havoc and confusion without knowing the cause until finally they come face to face... I saw it 10 years ago, several times because of its watchability. The soundtrack was excellent -- I still remember some of the tunes now. Feeling down, need a lift? This flick will rejuvenate your spirit for open-hearted fun living. 9/10",
         "Lots of karate antics, action, and lovely ladies as 2 Jackie Chans' try to outfox a band of hooligans intent of their demise. Slapstick humor all the way as Chan escapes one impossible to escape mess after another. This was a funny film, but it got a little trying at times keeping up with who was who.",
         "\"Twin Dragons\" is both a funny and action packed movie. Two twins are separated at birth. One learns to take care of himself after living on the streets... the other becomes a talented musician. Hilarious complications ensue when one is mistaken for the other... This is a very entertaining movie. Jackie Chan excels in both roles- and the martial arts (especially in the last scenes) are incredible. There is also a lot of brilliantly timed comedy. Even the music score is excellent. Watch for brief appearances by many of Hong Kong's top directors- Kirk Wong (director of \"The Big Hit\" and \"Crime Story\") as \"Crazy Kung\", John Woo (\"The Killer\" \"A Better Tomorrow\" are two of his best movies) as a priest... Tsui Hark's scene is especially funny. Lau Ka Leung (director of \"Drunken Master II\") and Ringo Lam also appear. Don't miss this movie.",
         "Well the movie itself was good. But! There are only 5 action scenes! The first action scene is a classic so is the car factory fight scene at the end! Also there is bus chase on the streets of Hong Kong. Brief fight scene in a mall. And A boat chase on the sea. And otherwise the movie is funny as hell. But the two great directors didn't make this the best movie there is. This a comedy filled with action. I liked it. BUT ONLY ONE JACKIE CAN FIGHT. So go rent this funny movie with some nice chases, stunts, and fights.",
         "It's no \"City Hunter,\" but this is a pretty goofy flick...It's just good fun though, and even if you think twin movies are bad---THIS IS JACKIE CHAN!!! I like it, it's just a cute, fun flick. Let's not forget to mention the ending though, it's worth the price of admission alone, with some of the coolest and most dangerous stunts I've ever seen! Can't take my eyes off Nina Li, or Maggie Cheung either!",
         "My favorite Jackie Chan film, a showcase for his physical skill and personal charisma. It has the right amount of fighting without becoming boring and monotonous; it has the right amount of comedy without being over the top. The sex farce is played like Feydeau and yet is handled deftly enough to allow one to take one's older children without squirming on anyone's part. Great!",
         "This is not a review, really, it's just to point out that all but one or two of the reviewers of Twin Dragons probably saw the butchered American version of this funny, clever, exciting movie and not the full- length, sub-titled Hong Kong original. I vividly recall taking a friend to see this when it opened (American Version) and watching for scene after favorite scene (remembered from a viewing in NY's Sun Sing Theatre in Chinatown) which never appeared! Afterwards, I stuttered through an explanation of why it was really a funny, exciting film only to be met by blank stares. I'll give only one example: The scene in the mall. (semi-spoiler) Originally, it was an exciting, but funny scene that ends with the thug Jackie beats up wanting to be his student! Not only is all of the character development in the scene cut out, but the music is completely altered to try to make a comic scene seem like a deadly serious fight! Clearly, someone at the distribution company decided that American audiences were so tone-deaf that they simply couldn't appreciate wit and cleverness, only rock-em, sock-em brain-dead action, so they performed a lobotomy on this swell little gem. They should change their names to \"Silk Purse Into Sow's Ear Production Company.\" Perhaps future reviewers will bother to note whether they saw the full 100 minute Hong Kong version or the embarrassing (let's all cover our eyes quickly) 89 minute American mess.",
         "I'm not a particular fan of twins-comedies, but Jackie Chan's Twin Dragons is luckily slightly different from every other such film. For the most part, but unfortunately we still get a few irky scenes. Special-effects wise I have to say, a few of the spliced scenes were a little clumsy but not distractingly so. Also the film has a lot of great off the wall comedy and something different. The 'twins-effect' which occurs all through the film is a nice element to spice up the plot. Naturally Jackie gives us a brilliant physical performance as well. The only real problem with Twin Dragons is that it doesn't offer anything particularly new or different from other Jackie films and thus feels a little unremarkable. However, Jackie's fans are likely to enjoy the film.",
         "Twin Dragons sees Jackie playing two characters, one a classical composer and the other a mechanic/thug who meet up after years of being separated. Each gets mistaken for the other, plunging them into his brother's relationships and problems. As a comedy Twin Dragons is occasionally funny but never made me laugh too hard. It's the kind of wacky antics I enjoyed from my Jackie Chan movies when I was an early teenager, but has worn out as I got older. Technically it has some really good action scenes, especially the last one, though none are too memorable in the grand scheme of things. For me, this is a mildly amusing Chan movie. Nothing new here, just more of the same kind of antics you'd expect from Jackie.",
         "This movie just goes off. It is the type of movie that as the credits are rolling at the end the movie still feels like it is going on. This, I think, is one of Jackie Chan's best movies. When it was released, comments were made about how is was similar to Van Damme's Double Impact. The SBS critic said that there was a slight difference between Twin Dragons and Double Impact: Twin Dragons is ten times better. He is not wrong. However, Double Impact, while being an action movie, is not the only movie, or story, about twins and the comedy in which they are mistaken. There is Cheech and Chong's Corsican Brothers, and of course there is Shakespeare's Comedy of Errors (suggesting that the concept does predate the 15th Century since Shakespeare was hardly original). The movie is about identical twins who are violently separated at birth and do not know of each others existence. One becomes a concert pianist and the other an auto mechanic. Then the concert pianist comes to Hong Kong for a concert while the other becomes embroiled in a plot concerning a Hong Kong gang lord. Then the movie goes into a confusion where everybody is mistaking one of the twins for the other, and the twins, upon realising the other's existence, try to hide each other's existence. Theme wise the movie is quite shallow, but one does not watch Jackie Chan movies for the in-depth theme. If you want in-depth themes you watch Ridley Scott. Some directors, such as John Woo and James Cameron, are known for action and interweave themes in with their movies, but when it comes to Jackie Chan, all you have is cool comedy and cool fights. Personally the fight scenes in this movie were not all that cool, and actually started to get boring, but the whole twisted plot of Twin Dragons just went off."
