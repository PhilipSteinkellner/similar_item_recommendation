         "This movie starts off hilariously . . . then tapers off into less laughs. This is unlike one of the director's other films, Fear of a Black Hat, where the humor was constant throughout the movie. Some good one liners and physical comedy but you *have* to see the police line-up scene with John Witherspoon. Truly funny! This movie starts off hilariously . . . then tapers off into less laughs.

         "When I first saw Sprung in 1998, I was overwhelmed at how real I related to the female characters about men and relationships. I have watched this movie about 20 times. I feel as if I could really base this movie on my life, because it seems so real. I wholeheartedly relate to this movie. Rusty Cundieff is a real down to earth character. I really respect and admire him alot.",
         "Overall this is not a great movie but it does contain the funniest sex scene of all time. It is worth it just to see that.",
         "I just picked up this movie for no apparent reason...seeming 90% of movies i rent is horror...i went for a little \"Change\" and decided to hire Sprung! I didnt expect much from this film,but i got more than i bargained for....although not all jokes went out to the open,alot did and cracked me up...This film is good because it takes alot of time to \"explore\" all the characters,so you get to know them more...if you do not explore the character,you dont care about him/her,the sex scene was so hilarious!! Catch this one for some laughs!!!Dont expect too many laughs,but expect a story of sex and friendship! 6.7 out of 10",
         "Sprung can be summed up in one word, Average. There is nothing that makes this movie very bad but there is also nothing that makes it very good either. Tisha Campbell gives an above average performance as one of the few level headed character in the film but the other three leads didn't quite measure up to her. As for the plot, it's funny most of the time it tries to be. But the movie begins to drag considerably in the second half when the writers shift focus from all comedy to mostly the love story. While Sprung did have some nice innovations, they couldn't make up for the inconsistent plot and some sub-par acting.",
         "Sprung was one of the funniest black romantic comdies releaded in 1997. While it's not good as the vastly superior Love Jones it does have a lot of charm. I remeber seeing this film after my first high school sweetheart broke up with me. The prison line up scene is very funny. Joe Torry and Paula Jai Parker steal almost every scene there in with their funny one-liners. Director Rusty Cundiff is very taltented and it's a shame he's hasn't made any films since this one.",
         "Rusty C and Tisha Campbell were paired up 3 times that I personally know of. They first were in School Daze, you may not recognize them though, since he didn't have much hair then and was much younger. While Tisha 'of course' was wearing extensions/wig (to this day I'm not completely sure). Then he was a writer for the movie 'House Party 2' starring Kid n Play. While Tisha played Kids love interest (in all 3 versions that is). And now they starred in this movie together - this time playing opposite one another. The question I ponder is did they interact prior to this. In 'Daze' they didn't have much contact on the movie screen but could have spoken off camera. While with HP2 they most likely didn't speak unless she confronted him on her lines in the script. Who knows there maybe other movie/TV spots/etc that puts these two together."
