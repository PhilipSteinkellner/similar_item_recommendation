In 2013, the Russian parliament passed a ban on so-called 'gay propaganda' that effectively makes nearly any public discussion of gay equality a crime.

      "reviews": ["Michael Lucas and Scott Stern have done a great service to the LGBT international community with this film. I am delighted to have seen it on Netflix. I hope this will broaden its distribution. Aside from opening Western minds to the issues in Russia, the film also reminds those in gay-friendlier societies that their job is not done to secure the rights of all LGBT people. The participants in this documentary, including Lucas who interviewed a clearly unhinged Russian parliamentarian, are heroic. I am not overstating. An American or European may not understand this. We are horrified in the U.S. now by high school bullying or the occasional sex murder of a gay adult. As a 66 year-old (Russian-American) gay man, I once lived under the kind of society which now prevails in Russian cities. Police harassment, public attacks, media propaganda against gays and lesbians were all a mainstay of my early years right here in Boston. The style of the documentary reminds me of early LGBT films here in the U.S. during the 1970's. I found it equally compelling, but I think this young ADD-prone generation is likely to find the deliberate pace difficult. That is not a criticism of the film but an assessment of the potential audience. And that in itself is troubling. Finally, I have to commend Michael Lucas, a gay man and a Russian, who has most likely made a very good living in the gay adult video business here in the U.S and abroad. Few people in the arts make such a personal contribution back to their communities. Even fewer would take the risks inherent in this projects. Bravo, Michael Lucas."],
