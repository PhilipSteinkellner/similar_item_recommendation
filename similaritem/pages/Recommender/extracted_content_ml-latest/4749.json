         "There is so much I could say about this movie. The cinematography, the music, the allegory...bittersweet indeed. The child actors...so young, so full of talent. Tum tum's impassioned cry of \"scccraamble!!!\" brings tears to my eyes and joy to my soul. There are no words. But maybe there are: Breathtaking. Original. Quality. Innovation. Family. Love. Peace. And violence. But beyond it all, the ultimate moment of this film arrives not near the conclusion, but in the subtle beauty and grace of Nurse Shibuya (played by the irreplaceable Glen Chin, in the finest role of his illustrious career). See here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GusQxS9pRTw I can say no more without dulling the gleam of this artistic vision. Fight on, brave ninjas, fight on.",
         "Growing up, I really loved these movies. Sean Fox was the end-all be-all for me. I don't think that now, but I love this movie. The action, although corny, is still really awesome. Again, this is NO JACKIE CHAN, by any standards. But still, little kids as ninjas?? Also, Miyo was cool. Adding that little love story between her and Rocky was a given, but it was sweet. I love the part when he totally screws up the pitch because he keeps on thinking there are Lisa DiMarino's everywhere. And, \"We should run!\" \"We should hide!\" \"LET'S KICK THEIR BUTTS!!!!!!!\" LOL! Again, I really am a kiddie-movie person, but I love this movie. If you're the same kind of person, rent this movie!!!",
         "what a fantastic blast from the past. the comedy, the generic character dynamics, and the morals hold up even now more than a decade later. the movie centers around 3 children - rocky, colt, and tum tum (the last who is too young to be anything but comedic relief) and their quest to help their grandfather return a mythical dagger. but along the way, they utilize their grandfather's teachings on being a ninja (using \"ninjuity\" - their words, not mine) and begin an adventure that strikes of an indiana jones tale on a smaller, tamer scale. the camera pans are excellent - probably an unnoticed feature of the movie is the way they show first person perspective, and the way they shoot japan from the perspective of the 3 ninjas. the comedy is gold (at least for the time). the movie is designed for children and engages in childish humor - you have silly slapstick, childish repartee, fart jokes, and the whole gamut of tame childhood morals and experiences. i have never seen any other 3 ninjas movie, but i do know i saw this one over and over again when i was a kid. i heavily recommend it for kids although adults won't appreciate it as much or at all if they're seeing it for the first time. otherwise the nostalgia factor is super high.",
         "I loved this movie, I'm a girl and I love action movies. Especially Karate and stuff. I also do Karate so i guess when I chose this movie I knew that it would be really good! My favorite actor in the movie has got to be Max Elliott Slade (Colt), I just think that he is so hot! Not only that but talented too. Too bad he's not acting anymore, or is his? If anyone has any in formation on him please let me know. I would really like to know if he is still acting. Well as for the movie I think that it is really good and I would love to see the sequels. Also it's a shame that some of the actors could not be in all of the movies. But these things happen.",
         "They're baaaaaaack! Rocky, Colt and Tum Tum in their first adventure since their last! Now, older, and more advanced. Grandpa now tells them they're ready to learn from a teacher in Japan. But before they can go, the boys have a baseball match which really takes a turn for the worse. Also, a childhood rival of Grandpa Mori Shintaro's (Funny, wasn't his last name Tanaka in the last movie? Oh well) by the name of Koga wants revenge for a past accident, and because Grandpa has in his possession a dagger from a championship match that he felt he should've won, so he sends his dimwitted nephew and two of his numb skulled buddies to Grandpa's house to get it. Rocky, Colt and Tum Tum meet them and really kick things up. Later on, Grandpa goes to Japan and get's in a cab accident, so the boys use \"Ninjanuity\" to get there and help. While in Japan, the boys make new friends and new enemies. Stupid, loud sequel to the unfunny original, it has no acting skills whatsoever. All copies need to be burned and tossed in the garbage. A total bummer. Rated PG for Violence.",
         "[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Rocky, Colt and Tum-Tum are still in Ninja training from their grandfather, Mori Shintaro. (Funny, wasn't his last name Tanaka in the last movie?) Grandpa has now decided it was time for the boys to learn from a teacher far greater than he. One in Japan. It just so happens that he must go to Japan to present a dagger to the winner of a tornament. He had won that dagger when he was a lad, and he used it to accidentally scar his opponent, Koga's face. Legend has it that that dagger and a sacred sword will open a cave of gold. That sword was snatched from a museum in Japan that night, so someone believes the legend. It was Koga. All he needs now is the dagger, so he hires his nephew, Glam and his two bumbling friends, Slam and Vinnie to snatch the dagger. Grandpa heads to the airport to buy his one ticket. Apparently, the boys decided to stay and play baseball that weekend. Their last game sort of backfired after Colt lost it on the pitcher. The boys saw the three stooges head for the cabin, and they gave them a workout that sent them running away fast. Pretty soon, Grandpa was off to Tokyo. He wasn't there one hour and he ended up in the hospital, due to a car driven by Slam, Glam and Vinnie plowed into his taxi. The boys learn of this and must help! So they fly to Tokyo. They are left incharge of presenting the dagger to the winner. The winner was a girl, to their surprise. Her name is Miyo. She's excellent at Ninja, but is bad at baseball. So they teach her baseball and she teaches them Ninja. Pretty soon, the boys and Miyo are captured by Koga's men and Grandpa is snatched out of the hospital. They go to the cave of gold which turned out to be nothing special. When they all escape, Koga realizes the error of his ways. The boys and Grandpa head home and are just in time for the game! They are triumphant! Though not as good as the first one, this movie was still pretty good. Part III in the trilogy, 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up, was actually made after the first one, it's release was just held, for some reason. It wasn't very good, neither is part 4, 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain. Don't see 3 or 4. Like the Jaws trilogy: 1 and 2 are good, 3 and 4 are not. --",
         "I like watching these films where the kids are strong enough to fight against the bad guys. I guess it reminds me of the Little Rascals. I will always make time to see this film. It is a great family show, kids, and adults will not have to be bored watching it. There is plenty of action. The boys have a grandfather that teaches them how to protect themselves and all about the heritage of the Ninja.The boys love their grandfather, and manage to get into trouble, but get out of it too because of what they learned from the grandfather. They love being with him, and enjoy his company. If you liked home alone then you will love this movie too. There is non stop action, and fight scenes geared to the family, no bad language, but loads of laughs as they beat up on the bad guys. Entertainment and fun. You cannot beat that combination!",
         "well, I don't care what others say about this movie. it is a wonderful sequel and although I liked the two ninjas they had in the first one, they did a good job replacing them, for whatever reason that they did. But to me it is still a ninja movie b/c it still has my fav ninja in it and it still has Grandpa. and they do a great job at making it feel like the other two had always been there.I love that this shows more of their sacrificial side and how when they find out that Grandpa is in trouble they drop every thing and will stop at nothing to get to him and help him. unlike most movies nowadays, it's clean and entertaining. that is amazing:) I really love it as I do the first and third ones. Even though they disagree a lot in the movie, they never once use their \"Ninja Knowledge\" to take on each other:) It's a wonderful movie, I've grown up with it and I thank God for the memories that I have with it.",
         "Another amazing comeback into the 3 Ninjas series. \"3 Ninjas Kick Back\". 3 Ninjas Kick Back was also a classic and really good kids family film. A kick-butt action-comedy-family film. The boys, Max Elliott Slade, Sean Fox, and Evan Bonifant were so awesome! 3 Ninjas Kick Back was so funny and full of true Martial Arts. Victor Wong who starred as Grandpa he did great and connected very well with the boys in this one as well. Charles T. Kanganis who directed film. Awesome job! Sang-OK Shin and Mark Saltzman thanks for writing such a amazing kick-butt story. 3 Ninjas Kick Back truly rocks! We all remember watching this one too as a kid and watching it via Television whenever it showed. 3 Ninjas Kick Back was always a joy to watch because truly it rocks and kicks-butt. There's nothing negative about the film itself. I recommend it for everyone and you should check it out if you haven't today. If you loved the other additions you'll love this one 3 Ninjas Kick Back will rock your world! these boys are amazing.",
         "Watching the movie now, yes I could see why it would get horrible scores. but as a 7 year old boy this movie was one of my all time favorites. Me and my brother would watch it all the time. We truly loved it. But that was when I was a simpler person. Back then I would have given it a 10, and now I would have given it probably a 4 or so. But for nostalgic purposes I will put it at a 7. I would easily go back and watch this movie just to relive my good ol' childhood days. It was all cheesily done, but the bad guys had a nice comical touch to it. And I remember enjoying the voice over for the grandpa that the kids made... Oh... those were the days..."
