Even for professionals such an enterprise -he decides to dig a tunnel- is quite demanding, but for simple commoners it's daunting, as they also have their personal downsides; thus Victor's wife has a most unwelcome tendency to blurt out the truth, even to the grumpy local copper: a crazy risk when you need to keep a criminal plan secret.",

      "reviews": ["After a guy foolishly trusts his money with a downright evil bank owner(who tricks him out of it with bogus stock tips), he tries to get it back the shortest way: by digging a tunnel from his basement to the vaults. Lucky for him, he lives nearby. Of course this drags a lot of hilarious situations along with it. Well, some I guess. I'm probably used to the other type of comedies that bring gags of the same or lower quality like, every second. Still, this old-timer baffoonery can be appreciated, because De Funes is professional about it. He's better than the material he's given. He's above these types of things,but then again, they suit him brilliantly. This is not a one man show,but it seriously should be. This has more padding than McDonalds-beef. One bothering plot hole: there's no way anybody could think anybody other than them robbed the bank. It's just so obvious, we have scenes in which they ask about security, or in which the kid is ever so curious what the vault looks like, and they have a motive, and they can constantly be seen with massive amounts of shovels or covered with dirt, and they actually ask a guy about digging tunnels. I know, I know, it's just a funny little movie."],
