            "content": "Is it safe to assume that the flea-bitten feline fantasy **Nine Lives** has completely gone to the dogs? Do not let this cockeyed kiddie comedy fool you because despite its intentional cuteness involving a self-deprecating, wise-cracking wealthy businessman-turned-hedonistic hairball may be appealing to the Romper Room crowd **Nine Lives** has all the comical chops of juggling chunky kitty litter. Charmless, insipid and trivial, this juvenile clawed and clumsy caper showcasing cheesy-minded whimsy about a hybrid self-absorbed big bucks blowhard/adorable pesky pussycat and the lead little gal enjoying the mystical mayhem at large may lower the IQs for the tot-friendly audience it looks to cater to with cheap, cloying chuckles.\r\n\r\nPerhaps ragging on a fetid fluff fable as **Nine Lives** is probably as blasphemous as kicking a twitchy-nosed bunny in its precious tummy. The question remains, however, if the bunny initially deserved that harsh kick? It boggles the mind as to what notable names are attached to this toothless, ticklish project. Director Barry Sonnenfeld, the heralded puppeteer behind hits such as _Men in Black_ and _Get Shorty_, inexplicably tries to breathe loony life into this stillborn catty concoction of recycled sight gags, and sugary sentimentality. Still, the manufactured roguishness and obviousness of the lightweight high jinks will have one pawing for something more, er\u2026purrrrr-cisely appetizing. In addition to Sonnenfeld\u2019s mediocre directorial efforts behind the camera, the real curiosity is how two-time Oscar winner Kevin Spacey signed on the dotted line to partake in this catnip-laced catastrophe. Amazingly, **Nine Lives** not only boasts one Academy Award winner in the aforementioned Spacey but two with the inclusion of the ubiquitous off-the-wall Christopher Walken. The only true sympathetic victim subjected to this tepid tail-wagging tease is the helpless cat forced to carry this Disney-esque dud on its poor furry shoulders.\r\n\r\nNoticeably, **Nine Lives** tries to be slick in tackling (or loosely exploiting) the current phenomenon of two separate entities: the popularity of the countless infectious YouTube online cat videos that aim to soothingly please the masses and the satirical profiling of controversial 2016 American presidential hopeful Donald J. Trump (through Spacey\u2019s callous characterization). Granted **Nine Lives** has its occasional brushes with welcomed impishness but for the most part this nutty narrative pussyfoots around in a total lackluster whimper.\r\n\r\nSpacey plays a megalomaniac multi-millionaire New York City-based real estate developer named Tom Brand whose specialty in spouting stylish skyscrapers within his congested urban landscape keeps him hungry for more success and business-minded progression. The problem is that Brand\u2019s workload often interferes with spending quality time (or any time for that matter) with second wife Lara (Jennifer Garner in a throwaway role) and impressionable daughter Rebecca (Malina Weissman). Clearly, Brand\u2019s neglect of his loved ones is inexcusable but the boorish tycoon does care for his offspring Rebecca although his tendency to stomp on his employees and rivals comes second nature for him. Nevertheless, Brand wants to ensure that his Rebecca receives a special upcoming 11th birthday gift to remember. After all, she is Daddy\u2019s little princess.\r\n\r\nRebecca happens to be an insane cat lover. Tom, on the other hand, cannot stomach the four-legged cuddly critters. So Brand has no choice but to satisfy his darling\u2019s wishes as he bites the bullet and visits a questionable pet store operated by creepy Felix Perkins (a seemingly disinterested Christopher Walken). Brand dutifully purchases a striking-looking tomcat named Mr. Fuzzypants for Rebecca to relish as her prized present. Suddenly through a convoluted \u201caccident\u201d criminally wealthy Tom Brand becomes comatose. Additionally, he is transported inside the hairy-coated body of Mr. Fuzzypants. And there you have it\u2013Rebecca\u2019s ultimate wish for the ideal birthday gift as having her absent Daddy Dearest Tom and beloved pet cat Mr. Fuzzypants rolled into a 2-for-1 sale package for her to treasure.\r\n\r\nAside from the predictable puns, lame and cutesy dialogue and by-the-numbers sophomoric bits **Nine Lives** drags and feels as relentlessly ragged as a victimized toy mouse at the mercy of an inner city neighborhood feral tabby. Painfully witless and wooden there is not much for the on-screen participants to do in this flea collar farce other than to play second fiddle to the synthetic exploits of the Spacey-voiced CGI domesticated bushy-tailed beast. Sure, it is easy to dismiss **Nine Lives** as mindless entertainment for the indiscriminate rug rats looking for child-like escapism. The youngsters (or oldsters for that matter) are better off chuckling at the mini funny feline features on the Internet as opposed to tolerating this fledgling fantasy about profit-making papas becoming humbled by the outer-body experience of a playfully turbulent tomcat in order to appreciate what his true and genuine riches are at hand\u2013the foundation of family. It is actually a rather nice message to promote for the kids but it is woefully undermined by the forgettable goofiness that persists in this comedic cat-box.\r\n\r\nSpacey\u2019s Trump-inspired business-minded blowhard Brand is something that could have been rejoiced in another forum if it was not lazily trapped inside this pointless kid-friendly spectacle. The iconic presence of Walken as the resident eccentric cat whisperer is wasted and forgettable. The ones you truly feel sorry for in this merry-minded mess is the doomed duo of Weissman\u2019s Rebecca and her cat cohort Mr. Fuzzypants as they try to capture the childish spirit. Sadly the adult participants in **Nine Lives** need to have their SAG cards revoked. Not since 1993\u2019s _Look Who\u2019s Talking Now_ has voiceover critters been so relentlessly annoying.\r\n\r\nThe 87-minute **Nine Lives** feels like it equally drained the single life out of Mr. Fuzzypants and more important\u2013the movie ticket buyers.\r\n\r\n**Nine Lives** (2016)\r\n\r\nEuropaCorp\r\n\r\n1 hr. 27 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Garner, Christopher Walken, Malina Weissman, Teddy Sears, Talitha Bateman, Mark Consuelos, Robbie Amell, Cheryl Hines\r\n\r\nDirected by: Barry Sonnenfeld\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: PG\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy/Fantasy & Adventure\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s rating: * 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) **Frank Ochieng** 2016",

            "content": "**We learn from our mistakes, but some people from a supernatural accident!**\r\n\r\nSo another switching body and soul theme, but not as bad as it looks. The problem is, it was so ordinary story, like the writers were never serious about making it big. That is the first thing what this film compromised. That makes it the quality of a television film. I mean the production quality was amazing, including all the graphics parts, but the plot was not developed to greater heights. So falls short to entertain its viewers, especially if you had seen films like 'Fluke' and others. The younger kids might like it, but this film was made keeping in the mind all the ages. So surely anybody can watch this, but the joy is limited.\r\n\r\nVery sad to know it was made by 'Men in Black' director. For his capability, this is a silly film. I don't know the reason, maybe he was tricked and the only way out is making this film. Whatever, his presence was what made this film so rich in the technical side. This is the story of a successful businessman who is a proud owner of the tallest building in the northern hemisphere. There's no respect by him for his employees and he totally neglected his family, particularly his young daughter. But one fateful day, his soul gets trapped in a cat and from there, how he's going to make it back is what told with his great struggles.\r\n\r\nI would say the cast was decent and so the screenplay, but the CGI cat was awesome, almost flawless for such a small film like this. The story and its events were not explained in details for us like how it had all happened like its logic. Since we are familiar with this type of films, they skipped most important segments and went directly to the story to develop which is actually the struggles like fighting back to break the curse than shaping up it with a neat story. So in my viewpoint, it is okay for watching once. This is a comedy, but you would hardly laugh. Yet much better than those real comedies from the recent times.\r\n_\r\n6/10_",

         "I've read some awful reviews about this movie and my expectations were set low. I was expecting to be dragged by my kids to a mix of \"Baby Geniuses 2\" and \"Battlefield Earth\". But I was pleasantly surprised. This movie won't win any Oscars, but its a reasonable kids movie. Kids liked it, and I was OK with it. Yes, the plot is predictable, and the jokes are pretty flat, but they are geared toward 10 year olds and adults who really like cats, and that is what is expected from a kids movie about a cat. If you hate cats, well, don't see it, see \"Shaggy Dog\" instead, its virtually the same plot, except its a different type of a pet. I think this movie is OK and I look forward to seeing new incarnations of the same plot in the future movies, such as \"Being Goldie\" (hint, hint movie studio, in about 10 years we will be ready for another one of those plots)",
         "We almost didn't watch this movie because the ratings were so bad, I am sorry I waited this long! I went with my sister and my kids aged 10 and 7, we laughed the whole way through! It was such a funny movie. I loved all the characters, especially frustrated Mr. Fuzzy Pants..! The supporting characters were great especially Christopher Walken and Cheryl Hines. Jennifer Garner and the girl cast as her daughter were beautiful and perfectly cast. Yes the story was a little predictable, but it didn't matter..the cat antics were hysterical, cat lovers and Kevin Spacey lovers will enjoy this film. We wanted an enjoyable family, summer movie and we got it!! PLEASE go watch this movie! It's a great last hurrah before school starts :)",
         "OK, I agree that this is no Citizen Kane, but I was amazed at the critical reviews and low IMDb score. I think perhaps to appreciate this you need to be particularly fond of cats and/or been a cat owner. But if you are then this film is a perfectly serviceable slice of family entertainment, and frankly there are much, much worse films out there. Kevin Spacey and Chris Walken are dependable as always and I think there is plenty about this that kids will enjoy. Worth a look as a Sunday afternoon family film in my opinion, or perhaps as something you can put on to keep the kids amused.",
         "That is nice and funny movie. Yes, I cant say I was laugh as crazy as I usual do at the comedies, but anyway, this cartoon made me smile all the time. What is really important about this movie is that kids had fun while watched it. And adult persons with them. Everyone felt positive and nice feelings. That is really very beautiful and bright movie with many funny characters. The story is not hard for understanding that's why its easy to sit through. Wish to see more movie just like this one.",
         "In case there is any doubt, there are cats, real ones, in Nine Lives not zombies/vampires/ax-wielding psychopaths (choose one) that come alive every nine years to terrorize a village/teens/family (choose one) with blood and gore abound. So unless you at least like cats a little, you may not like Nine Lives. But I can tell you that the kids in the audience I was in--loved it. And so did the adults who came to the movie with me. (Yeah, OK, I admit we like cats.) And I think in the end that may be all that matters. What saddens me are the many critics, and wannabe critics who are trashing, and I mean trashing, this film. Now that they have had their opinions and comments, everyone has a right to MY opinions and comments. Here are a few... I grew up going to see Disney live action family comedy/fantasy films such as The Shaggy Dog (to which this film is similar), The Absent Minded Professor, Son of Flubber, the Love Bug films and so on. (I think the great theatre actress Helen Hayes was in a Love Bug.) Were these Oscar caliber films? No, they were made to be good family entertainment. Did Oscar award winning actors appear in them...you bet your life they did. If in doubt, check IMDb for the casts of Disney live action films made in the 50's 60's and 70's. I liked the characters in the film, their connections to each other, and the love shown throughout the film. (Note: I am not mentioning Kevin Spacey, Christopher Walken, Jennifer Garner et al. here, because I saw them as characters not actors. One of the criticisms of the film is that some critics could not believe a certain actor(s) would make this kind of film or play that kind of part. That is not a criticism. Actors play all kinds of characters. It's their job. So I look at how well they played the characters. Were the characters believable? I admit there is some broad character acting. This is not uncommon, however, in a fantasy/comedy, especially one playing to a kid audience. So taking this into consideration\u2014were they believable for a comedy/fantasy film? Yes. Back to what I liked about the characters--I loved that the daughter clearly loved BOTH her mother and her neglectful father. I loved that the ex wife and wife, both very different people, were friends. I loved that the older step brother loved his younger step sister, loved his father and was loyal to him despite the rude things his father said to him. I loved that family love remained constant, although wavering at times, even when the head of the family had a difficult time sharing his love with them. In a cynical world, this kind of family love does not exist, but we can hope for it. Third, I liked the story. Nine Lives is a comedy but it is also a fantasy. I think this is what some of the critics forget. Fantasy requires that we believe things that may not be possible or logical. If we believe all the things Harry Potter and his friends did, why can't we believe a man could change places with a cat to learn a lesson. (By the way, one of the professors in Harry Potter could change into a cat\u0085and she was an Academy Award/Emmy winner.) I do think the business story about the tallest building was weak, but I think that may matter more to adults than kids. (And, who knows it might be the kind of thing that might matter to someone like, say...Mr. Trump.) This part of the story gave an opportunity for the villain(s)to be established, and again for the son to show his loyalty and love for his father and his father's ultimate love for him. Fourth, and this is a personal/technical thing...it was not animated, except for CG effects. I love animated films. Some of my favorite films are animated. In fact there was 15 minutes of nothing but animated film previews before this film started. I felt it was nice to see actual humans...and cats...for a change. Thankfully, too, the cat's mouth is not animated to look like it's talking. There is no Academy Award to-be-nominated song, although I did like \"Three Cool Cats\". So I can't trash this film. It made me laugh. It made me feel good. The underlying message is simple, love your family...if you are human, you only live once so do it right. And if this message is cliché, it can't be said enough, especially in these times. So, if just this is enough motivation for you or you and your kids to see it...Don't paws, go! PS: By the way, real cats are not allowed in the movie theatre. They will need to wait for the DVD. But I hear that stuffed toy cats are welcome.",
         "Great movie for kids and pet lovers. Some sweet moments. What's more important in life, lots of money or family. Language was mild, no memorable cursing. Clean movie. Christopher Walken played the part of a mysterious man with mystical connections who runs a pet shop with cats. These cats can become receptacles for humans who need to learn what's really important in life. Keven Spacey plays the billionaire whose greatest dream is to build the tallest building in North America. Jennifer Garner is the wife and mother. Their little girl wants a kitten for her birthday. Dad is not happy with that but ends up getting a cat. Don't want to say much more or I'll spoil the movie.",
         "This is a light-hearted comedy! Unlike Star Treks and the likes or cheesy teens comedies, easy to sit through. Good not only for teens, though a bit offensive for cats. Acting and casting are not for disappointments! I rate it 9 lives +1 for its longer life and against dog lovers' low ratings discriminating, habitually, against little cats on the big screen! After all, it is thought-provocative, with a cat character brought to life by a compelling and intelligent cat star. Young actress Malina Weissman as Tom's daughter Rebecca is sweet and innocent childlike. The movie is absolutely Underrated! Pre-paid bad publicity?((((((",
         "If you enjoy spending your money on constant remakes and comic book adaptations then you probably won't enjoy this movie. There are no 'dark' characters, violence or sex in this movie. If you want to see a movie that isn't loud and vulgar but simply a fun, easy watch then \"Nine Lives\" is right up your alley....Pun intended. I agree the premise of a \"workaholic parent that experiences a life- changing event to learn a lesson\" is a little overdone and tired. (It's basically the plot behind 50% of the content on \"The Hallmark Channel\".) However, the CGI graphics and an affinity for animal movies made this a movie I wanted to go see. Sure, the ending was mostly predictable, but I laughed through most of the movie. I believe Spacey did a good job with the role and Christopher Walken once again works the role of \"creepy character actor\" to its full extent. In a summer where comic book remakes like \"Suicide Squad\" and \"Avengers:Age of Ultron\" will be much bigger box office hits and a movie like \"Sausage Party\" draws ANYBODY to the theater....\"Nine Lives\" offers something that you DON'T see every 3 months....family fun.",
         "Why has this film been given such poor ratings? It is a lovely film, perfect for kids and adults alike. It is gentle, funny and charming. Visually it is a treat and the set designer deserves an award for producing such beautiful sets. Jennifer Garner never fails to charm and in this film and in this film she is perfectly matched with her little look alike daughter, Malina Weissman. Malina is perfectly cast and her future should be assured, based on her performance in this film. Cheryl Hines is very funny in her part of the ex-wife. Kevin Spacey is never my favorite actor, however he is perfectly cast as the self centered, uber successful business man, content to neglect his family. The film is funny with several laugh out loud moments. You don't have to be a cat lover to like the film but for those cat lovers out there you will recognize several famous cats. Overall it is a very enjoyable film. Go see it!",
         "For once in the summer of 2016 we had an opportunity to see a film that was not a sequel, prequel, remake, rehash, regurgitation or serialization of an other/previous film. i know Hollywood likes to bank on safety in Box-Office numbers but it was just nice to see something original. (where have all the screen writers gone?). And seeing this cast totally playing straight-person to felines: funny. (and fine acting too). Anyone who has a cat in their life will find this amusing. worth the price of the popcorn; i haven't laughed this loudly in the cinema for a long time. while we're on Box-Office: i wish the powers that be would NOT talk about films in terms of money made but tickets sold. the money figures will always get bigger as inflation is a fact of life. But are films selling as many tickets as they used to? End of rant.",
         "Barry Sonnenfeld's Nine Lives is a profoundly stupid movie. It's about a billionaire New York businessman who is egotistical, full of himself and likes to put his name on every building he owns (Sound like anyone who's been in the headlines a lot this past year?), and how he learns to be a better father to his adult son and young daughter, and a better husband to his wife, while having his soul trapped in his daughter's cat. The movie stars Kevin Spacey. Yes, Kevin Spacey, that most gifted and treasured of actors. The man has won numerous awards, including the Oscar and the Tony. Now he can probably expect a Razzie early next year. To be fair, he's not sleepwalking through this movie, though you kind of wish he was. He gives the material more effort than it deserves. The movie also stars Jennifer Garner as his wife, and Cheryl Hines as his ex-wife, who shows up to be humiliated once in a while. When Hines shows up at his penthouse apartment, Kevin Spacey (in cat form) decides to use her expensive purse as a litter box. Ho, ho. Spacey is Tom Brand, who wants to build the world's tallest skyscraper. When it's revealed that a building in Chicago is going to be taller, he has a fit, and threatens to miss his 11-year-old daughter's birthday party. Still, he's determined to impress her, so he races around Manhattan for a pet cat that she wants. This leads him to a tiny little pet shop run by a mysterious shopkeeper, played by Christopher Walken. The performance Walken gives is sadly subdued. A little bit of his strange humor would have done wonders. Tom picks out a cat named Mr. Fuzzypants, and then decides to head back to his corporate building, so that he can go to the roof in the middle of a thunderstorm and yell at his corporate lackey Ian (Mark Consuelos). To make a long story short, a stray thunderbolt knocks Tom off the roof, placing him in a coma. When Tom wakes up, his soul has been transported into the body of Mr. Fuzzypants, and he finds himself in the hospital where his wife and daughter are fretting over his unconscious human body. Fortunately, Christopher Walken is there to explain what has happened, and tells him he has to learn to appreciate his family in the cat's body before the doctor's pull the plug on his human body. Tom's wife and daughter (who don't seem nearly as distressed as they should be that he is clinging to life) bring Mr. Fuzzypants home, not knowing that Tom is inhabiting the feline. He tries to get their attention, but nothing seems to work. It's not until he starts bonding with his daughter that he starts to realize how important his family is. Nine Lives is credited to five different screenwriters, who must have gone home weary after a long day of dreaming up scenes like the one where Mr. Fuzzypants tries to open a bottle of scotch with his tiny paws. The cat itself is played by a combination of a real cat, and a blatantly CG one for when it has to leap off a windowsill and bounce off an awning, or when it starts doing amazing dancing and backflip moves. I'm not blaming the filmmakers for using special effects in order to display things that a real cat simply can't do. I just wish they made more of an effort, so the effects would look slightly more convincing than Gumby and Pokey. The movie is 90 minutes of pure mindless fluff with no nutritional value whatsoever. And no, I am not exactly condemning all fluff. I have enjoyed films that most have dismissed as such in the past. This is simply bad fluff. It's cheaply made, poorly written, and has absolutely nothing to offer other than those with the simplest of tastes. This is yet another movie that feels like nobody really wanted to make it, and just showed up every day. I will probably never know what drew Kevin Spacey to Nine Lives. All I can say is I hope he got more out of it than I did. At least he got paid. I got to sit in the dark, and wonder what I was doing with my life for 90 minutes.",
         "From a legal standpoint, and by that, I am referring to Writer's Guild regulations, according to the on-screen credits, it appears as though the screenplay was begun by (Matt Allen & Caleb Wilson) and then subsequently rewritten by (Dan Antoniazzi & Ben Shiffrin), before Gwyn Lurid completed the final shooting script. (For legal reasons, writers who collaborate together have their names linked with an ampersand, \" & \". while those who worked separately have their names separated by the word \"and\", according to the Writer's Guild regulations). It took five writers, at three different stages to dream up this horribly dated story of a corporate exec whose soul ends up trapped in the body of a cat? It feels like this may have been written in the early 1990s, storyboarded in the early to mid 90s (judging by the wardrobe and colour composition), but not filmed until 2015, and then sat unreleased for a further year, before being scraped out of the kitty litter box, and flung at cinema screens. Incredibly lame, with out-dated references (I counted at least two references to W. Bush, who left office nearly eight years prior to this film's release) and poorly done (and out of place) time lapse photography, and a mishmash of a screenplay which includes only a handful of Jokes, none of which are funny.",
         "Top 10 worst movies I've seen in my life. Part of it is that this idea is so used that it is just like watching Shaggy Dog but even stupider. Kevin Spacey which is one of the best of all time now tainted his reputation with this. When I saw the trailer I asked myself what are Kevin Spacey and Cristopher Walken doing in this. I asked if I could have my money back. An ELEVEN Metascore is just so bad that I cant even process why Kevin did this. I would love to ask him why did he do this. Now enough about Kevin because everything was just so bad. The acting was horrible and the screenplay was very poor. Anyone who reads this DO NOT WATCH NINE LIVES it is a waste of money.",
         "This was the movie everyone sneaked into see after watching Suicide Squad. I kept thinking to myself, why would Barry Sonnenfeld make a movie like this? Also thinking that House of Cards star, Kevein Spacey could have landed himself a better between seasons gig. So what's going on? I'll tell you what's going on, that cat is the reason why you want to see this movie. Kevin Spacey's soul gets trapped into a cat thanks to Christopher Walken, because he's neglecting his family for his company. In his attempts to convince his family that he's the cat, he starts doing the cutest things, thus becoming the longest (Possibly the most expensive) Youtube cat video ever made . There was one scene when the Cat (With Kevin Spacey's voice), attempts to write a letter to his family stating he's stuck in the cat. When the cat picks up the pen, my eyes popped out of my socket. Sure, as he starts to write you realize that this is CGI, but I was hooked. From that moment on it became about when was this cat going to reappear on the screen. I should have known this was going to happen as the movie started out with clips of cat's on the internet. As great of as Spacey is at playing the jerk you can't help but to love, That cat was the real movie star here. Every time it shares a scene with the little girl playing Spacey's daughter in the movie I'm all like \"so Cute\". As you can tell I'm a cat lover. If you are a cat lover you might enjoy the film as much as I do. Other than that. it's literally ninety minutes of nothing only worth seeing if you have nine lives to live.",
         "My girlfriend made sad faces at me until I agreed to go and see this with her today. And the movie is much, much better than I had anticipated from the trailers and promos I had seen (read: been shown against my will). I went in with a bad attitude and was pleasantly surprised. Some cheap CGI is to be expected, but doesn't ruin the movie. THE TRAILERS DO A TERRIBLE JOB OF ADVERTISING THE STRENGTHS OF THE FILM. It's a surprisingly mature and well-developed plot, and doesn't dwell too long on either the sappy bits or the humor. It is very plot-driven, and has nicely well-developed main characters (except the cartoonish villain). All of the movie both makes sense and flows very well. I rather liked Mr Spacey's character arc over the course of the movie, just the right amount of jerk at the beginning, and not too much lovey-dovey at the end. Mr Amell does a very good job as an aspiring businessman & under-appreciated son, though again the villain he plays against is weak. Ms Weissman plays a solid rich-kid middleschooler, though I suspect the part was intended to be a younger child. And most importantly, Christopher Walken's character was NOT overused or trite like the previews suggested. Unfortunately, there were some 'love or not' fakeouts with Ms Garner, but oh well. When you size it up against the in-genre competition, it frankly blows it all away. Not necessarily a 'children's movie' like you might expect, and worth the price of admission. My girlfriend would like to add that the 'celebrity cat cameos' are too short, which seems like a good thing to me.",
         "I almost didn't go because of the terrible ratings. I'm not sure what everyone's deal is with the CGI,they aren't going to put a real cat through all that. And \"cliche\", well most movies ARE repeats of different things nowadays. Maybe it's just because I love cats, but personally this movie was good. I'd suggest it to anyone, def cat lovers. This movie is still funny and a nice one to see. Don't listen to the bad ratings, give it a chance! Great, underrated movie.",
         "This fun film was full of laughs and little chuckles. Did the CGI look silly? Sometimes. Might casting have been different, maybe. Was it easy to catch on to where the story was going? It's possible. BUT, the cat is adorable. Christopher Walken is a hoot. The set design is crisp and classic. We almost passed on seeing this b/c of the mention that the character is like Donald Trump. Sure there are some parallels to him, but thankfully this was not really a political film, other than the Bush moments, which you can just roll your eyes at and move on. The theatre was full and everyone was along for the ride. The parents next to me who commented during the previews...of that's gonna be 2 hours that I'll never get back really seemed please with this film. I did enjoy it so much more that Secret Life of Pets.",
         "I saw the movie and I would like to comment on the storyline of \"Nine Lives.\" I found it to be disturbing. I understand and accept that the cats in the Purr-kins shop were there voluntarily and that some - like Mr. Fuzzy Pants - apparently agreed to donate some of their lives in order to help \"troubled\" humans straighten themselves out. But when the cats were given away, they were soon \"possessed\" by the spirit of the humans that needed their help. The cats ceased to be cats altogether and the humans were trapped inside the cats. If the human possessing the cats could or would not reform, then the cats remained possessed and would be lost forever. If the human successfully reformed, the cats would have to die, in order to release the repentant humans' spirit. Mr. Perkins states that love requires sacrifices. The spirit of Mr. Brand flings the body of Mr. Fuzzy Pants off a skyscraper in a futile attempt to save his son. It is the cat who is sacrificed, not the human. The cat may have been attracted to the human initially, but there is never love between them. How can the death of the cat be considered a loving sacrifice? The way that this movie presents itself, cats are just vessels to be used by humans and discarded. For those reviewers that state that this movie is about a man who is turned into a cat, that is not correct: the poor cat is possessed by the spirit of a man and that spirit thinks and behaves like his human self throughout the possession. As a cat lover, I resented the treatment of the cats in this movie as mindless objects whose sole purpose was to correct bad human behavior; there was no regard for the cruel fate that they would have to face - no matter the outcome for the human possessing them. I'm sorry, but this is not the kind of film that could be written by or intended for people who love and admire cats.",
         "This is a purrrrfect example of its genre, the \"animal movie.\" The animal movie is designed to appeal to the \"entire family\" meaning it's really for adults but safe to bring the kids to see. The target audience is lovers of the specific animal who is the main character, in this case, a cat. It features the animal's behavior in both funny and serious ways. It may have an uplifting message or tone, even if it deals with serious situations. Yep, checkmarked all those perfectly. The point of view character is the dad, Brand, stuck in a cat's body. Brand is a rich guy obsessed with building a giant tower with his name on it, who likes to fly through the air and land on his tower. So basically he's Tony Stark as a dad. How would Tony Stark be as a dad? Well, not that great. Until he learns to embrace cat-hood. I think this movie may have been mis-marketed a bit. All the previous that ran ahead of it were kids' movies. But the person the viewer is supposed to identify with is the parent. There are kids in the movie, but the dad-cat is the character who has a growth and redemption arc and is the focus of most of the scenes. The movie deals with some serious subjects such as death and divorce. The plot turns on knowing the meaning and significance of terms like \"articles of incorporation\" which you will need to be able to read off the screen and immediately understand to get what's going on, so younger kids might not be able to follow all of what's happening in the plot. They'll still enjoy the cat antics, though. I loved the destructive cat stuff: the jumping around, knocking things over, scratching things up (and scratching people up) and I literally laughed out loud a few times. I think I laughed the loudest when Mr. Fuzzypants peed in Brand's ex-wife's purse. There were some internet celebrity cats featured in the movie, too. It was hilarious! Go see it if you like cats.",
         "Anyone who owns a cat, knows you don't put their food and water next to the litter box. My granddaughter asked why. I asked her, \"would you want to eat your dinner next to the toilet?\" But Kudos to casting. The actress who played the daughter looks like she could be the daughter of Jennifer Garner. I have to write ten lines? But I have already said what I want to say. Well, now I'm up to 6 lines. This will probably get rejected because I am running on about nothing. I have heard of too many lines, but this is the first time I have heard of too few. Man, two more lines to create. What should I say? Thank you IMDb for the opportunity to write this. I hope you use it.",
         "I went into this movie with no expectations at all. Come on! It's 2016 and we get a talking cat movie? How did this even get a theatrical release!? Boy was I wrong! This might be one of the best movies of the summer in fact. The humor is on point, and the acting is overall really great! Oddly enough, Kevin Spacey might be the worst of the bunch. Maybe he had the same expectations as me? Oh well, that did not ruin the movie! Christopher Walken gives his best performance since Seven Psychopaths, Cheryl Hines is as always lovely and hilarious, and the young Malina Weissman.. She's gonna be a star! That's all I gotta say. And there's jokes for both kids and adults, so don't worry if you think this looks like a cheesy kids film - It's not! The movie had me rolling with laughter and an ending that actually made me tear up a bit. This is on par with Pixar/Disney movies like Inside Out, Toy Story, Zootopia. Make sure Nine Lives is the movie you don't miss! IT'S THE SLEEPER HIT OF THE YEAR!",
         "First of all, the cat (or cats) in the role of \"Mr. Fuzzypants\" was endearing and comical. The movie has a simple story line: a self absorbed millionaire businessman, played by Kevin Spacey, is simply too, well, self absorbed and into the ultimate profit to pay attention to his pre-teen daughter or grown son so he finds himself transformed into a feisty feline at the suggested hands of Christoper Walken's quirky and mysterious pet store owner. Spacey-as-the-cat goes through some growing pains emotionally, getting into a lot of trouble and learning not to be a jerk to his neglected wife (Jennifer Garner) or his decent kids. There's some good acting support from Cheryl Hines as his ex-wife (the first one) who's also the mother of his grown son (Robbie Amell). Mark Consuelos is on hand as the figurative mustache twirling villain who wants to undermine his boss and steal the company. The start of this film is a bit slow while we learn about Spacey's desire for \"the tallest building ever\" or something like that but it gets rolling once he visits Walken and gets turned into the kitty. It's pretty cool seeing both Spacey and Walken in something light and amusing like this, considering they usually play darker or often, villainous roles. Cute movie, worth the trip to see. Don't expect anything Oscar- worthy or filled with tons of crap exploding at every turn because this isn't that film. Check it out if you have kids or if the kid inside you isn't too jaded or dead yet.",
         "Even by children's movie standards, this film is awful. The plot is essentially that a Donald Trump wannabe--Kevin Spacey--winds up taking residence inside a cat's body while laid up in a coma. The selfish, tyrant is then taught valuable life lessons. If only the producers of this farce would have experienced the same transformation prior to making this movie, we'd all be better off. The premise of the film has some hope as a nice way to entertain the family without much worry. The cast is certainly talented and experienced. The problem is that the script is completely flat without one truly funny line or visual. All of the characters are nothing but cardboard cutouts and the actors appear to know this; everyone in this film seems to be going through the motions for a paycheck--even the normally reliable Christopher Walken. One telling example of the lousy script is that everyone in the Spacey character's life goes right back to normal existence almost immediately after he suffers a horrible accident and struggles for his life; this includes his own daughter, who seems more interested in her new cat than the fact that her dad is on life support. Sure, this is needed to move along the thin plot, but it still comes across awkwardly on screen. The cast continues to sleepwalk through the duration of the film, which makes it fairly difficult for the audience to care. The audience is also subjected to the typical Hollywood political drive-by messages--a George W. Bush picture gets defaced multiple times (which would never happen to a Democrat in a Hollywood film). It would be one thing if the scene was actually funny, but it was forced much like the rest of the film. With the plethora of family movies available, including the animated variety, there is no reason to spend time on this mess.",
         "I'll start by saying that I am not the target audience for this movie. I'm a single 38 year old man who hates cats. I also am a minister and I was asked to go along with a youth group from my church, so I went, not really knowing what I was getting myself into--I thought the movie was animated right up until the time that it started. That said, this is a live action film starring Jennifer Garner and Kevin Spacey. The gist of the plot is that Spacey plays a business tycoon whose little girl wants a cat for her birthday--but before Spacey gets the gift to the party, he's involved in an accident that leaves his body in a coma and his soul trapped in the body of the cat. Yeah. So what to say about this movie. To state the pros, it could be worse. I've given it four stars because that seems about right--it's a bad movie, but there are worse movies that have been made. The acting isn't terrible, and there are a few laughs spread throughout the film. I suppose if you were a cat lover you might like it, although I must say that the lady in our group who is the biggest cat lover of all (and I'm talking like, her entire house is decorated in cat stuff and she currently has thirteen cats living in her home) didn't like the movie because she thought the scenes were a bit rough on the cat. Those scenes were obviously CGI effects, but still--you get the idea. As for the cons, again there's the \"rough treatment of the cat thing\". But the much larger issue for me was that this was a kids movie that just didn't know how to be a kids movie very well. I know I said above that I'm a minister, and so it would be easy to pigeonhole my next comment as my being a prude, but trust me, that's not the case. I'm just a reasonably smart adult who knows the difference between a movie made for kids and one that's not. And this movie falls flat in the whole kid friendly department. Again, this is a movie about a man being trapped in a cat's body, and it was extremely clear that the target audience here was kids. Yeah, well....read on. First off, there is enough of a weird vibe going on with this script that it almost borders on deranged in the first place. I said almost. I'm not one of those people that looks down my nose at Harry Potter or anything like that, and I get that the gist of the story is all in good fun--but there's this whole element of mysticism involved in this movie, what with the soul swap thing and a strange \"cat whisperer\" played by Christopher Walken (as if waiting expectantly for him to produce a gold watch out of his pocket wasn't bad enough). That said, there's this almost Halloweenish feel to the movie--despite its being happy go lucky and kid oriented throughout most of the film. So the vibe of the script is the first red flag. Then you get into some particulars. The cat gets drunk off of scotch at one point. OK, again, I'm no prude--but why make intoxication a source of humor for a kids movie? Or the couple of times that a swear word was almost used? \"Son of a....\" trailing off into nothing. The little boy behind me turned to his mother and said \"Oh, he almost said a bad word!\" Why even have that in a kids movie? OR, for that matter, at one point Spacey's character does in fact say \"damn\". OK, I get it. It's 2016, not 1956. And certainly there are other kid friendly movies that have used their fair share of light swear words. E.T. The Goonies. Ghostbusters, etc. None of those movies were as childish or as overtly marketed to kids as this one was, though. And finally, at the end of the film there's a scene in which it is strongly implied that a character is about to commit suicide. I won't spoil it for you, but the point is that to even imply something like that is a little heavy for a movie targeted to fourth graders, if you ask me. I'm sure if I wanted to nitpick I could think of a few more problematic scenes. The relationship between Garner and Spacey and Spacey's ex is a bit odd for a kids movie. In fact, as I'm finishing up this review, it's just now hit me what the problem is: Someone decided to combine a romantic comedy with a kids movie. That's it! This movie is half \"Bridesmaids\" and half Disney, and the result is a strange film that doesn't fit well into either of those genres, thus falling flat all the way around. All that said, again, there are worse movies that have been made. But this is a bad movie, and there are better things to spend your money on at the box office right now.",
         "I kept trying to understand why it was so bad. I had a lot of time to wonder in the theater and liked the process because it distracted me from how very bad this was. It wasn't just that the dialogue was wooden and it seemed like Kevin Spacey (whom we all adore and is the reason I went to this picture) did his performance in over Skype while reading the script for the first time, or that the plot was so predictable you could leave, buy popcorn, apply for a refinance on your mortgage, come back and know exactly where you were - the movie is disturbing. The Big Bad Board was absolutely right. The story was so unbelievable even an 8-year-old will be asking: \"Can you do that in two days? Or at all?\" I have no idea what they did to that poor cat to make it walk \"drunkenly\" but it was horrible to see the fur all matted and strange - did they use masking tape? It was the director, I decided. He had to have told that girl to behave like a possessed, grinning animated walking dead ready to monster-morph and cook the cat for dinner. Pretty girl. I bet with the right part and director, she'd be delightful. Just ... don't."
