To get an idea of just how dangerous it is go be gay in the West Bank, the interviewees were unwilling to give the names of men they had been involved with, even one who was dead! We are permitted to see how NGO's are able to achieve the impossible in getting around inter/national laws and customs in finding safe havens for these men, but also to see how much it costs the men to make the transition."],

Where ever they go they live in fear of discovery. Only in Israel's gay underground are they at home. Eye opening and revelatory.",
