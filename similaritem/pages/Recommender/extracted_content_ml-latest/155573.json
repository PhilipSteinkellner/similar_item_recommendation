            "content": "A couple of Fridays ago, we had Vetri Maaran's Visaaranai, a hard-hitting film that was a damning one for the police force as it shined a light on the brutality that those with power unleash upon the defenseless. For them, Sethupathi should feel like a God-sent PR bonanza from Kollywood \u2014 even if that is entirely incidental \u2014 that acts to restore the public's faith in the force. Right from the title credits, which acts as homage to the men in khakhi (just like how the end credits of Thuppakki paid tribute to our army jawans), the film keeps celebrating cops.\r\n\r\nAnd it also brings back the masala movie cop, a character whose every action we are meant to cheer. Sethupathi (Vijay Sethupathi), an inspector about to be promoted as an assistant commissioner, is tenacious and fearless. A cop is murdered in a place that is under his jurisdiction and so he starts investigating the case. He finds out that the local big shot, Vaathiyar is connected to this killing and goes after him. He even arrests Vaathiyar (Vela Ramamurthy, who is as terrific in this bad guy role as he was as the kind-hearted patriarch in Paayum Puli), but an unforeseen accident involving a gun and a student, puts his career in jeopardy. However, Sethupathi soon realises that this accident has a connection to the case involving the dead cop. Now, he has to play a cat-and-mouse game with Vaathiyar while trying to hold on to his job.\r\n\r\nSethupathi is a Vijay Sethupathi show all the way. This is his first action hero role, and the actor turns on his star wattage to the maximum. Not since Vikram in Saamy has an actor effortlessly displayed that casual arrogance that is needed for a masala movie cop. Like Saamy, Sethupathi is a mix of brains and brawn, someone who can make gangsters tremble by just appearing before them and outthink his foes. Arunkumar shrewdly exploits this to give us one whistle-worthy moment after another. Two scenes, particularly, stand out. One, where he hides his face with a scarf to attack the villain's henchmen, after getting into trouble in an earlier scene when due to a video. In the other one, he relays instructions over phone to his wife (Ramya Nambeesan) and son and protects them from the goons who have broken into their house.\r\n\r\nThe director, who made the sweet-natured Pannaiyarum Padminiyum, goes all out to venerate his hero, and there are times when we begin to think if this unconcealed commercial approach is a response to the box office underperformance of his debut film. He certainly seems to have learnt a lesson from that on one account. The languid storytelling of the former is here replaced with a narration that is spry. And, thanks to his editor Sreekar Prasad and composer Nivas Prasanna's spunky score, he manages to achieve this without resorting to gimmicks like ramped up or hyper-edited shots.\r\n\r\nIf there is a hitch, it is the scenes that are set in Sethupathi's home. They are clearly meant to be fillers between the action scenes, and while the happy nuclear family sub-plot (with cute kids and marital romance) acts a feel-good counterpoint, the scenes become repetitive after a point. The other problem is that while the villain is formidable enough, his henchmen never come across as people who can pose a serious threat to Sethupathi. But, to Arunkumar's credit, there is hardly any lull in the film for us to start thinking about such niggles, and we just go along on this entertaining ride.",

         "The film starts out with an opening song 'Mazhai Thooralam' describing the life of an Indian cop.By the time this song ends,you know you're moved already. Vijay's body language is perfectly suitable to the 'cop' role.And that moustache - mass!I'm sure that this film is the best of his till date.Heroine and other actors were given decent roles.Although a routine cop story,direction was pretty good. The BGM music composed by Prasanna was mind-blowing.Every song had different combinations of rock and pop.The film is a perfect family and action packed entertainment. Trust me you won't regret watching 'Sethupathi'",
         "Finally saw Sethupathi. Wow, an awesome film. I was glued to the screen the whole time. Vijay Sethupathi is electrifying. Usually, in Indian films we have this conventional thinking that only fair skinned people can make good \"heroes\"... something very evident in Malayalam films (I'm from Kerala). But Vijay Sethupathi proves skin color is no barrier to that... he has an amazing screen presence and charisma. As a police crime drama, it works well. The story keeps you glued to the screen till the end. I'm glad that the director SU Arun Kumar avoided some of the clich√©s seen in mainstream films such as the comedy track for comedians or the over the top dialogue scenes. This is my first Vijay Sethupathi film. I haven't seen any of his other films. And I'm not a regular Tamil film viewer either. Definitely feel like watching more of his movies.",
