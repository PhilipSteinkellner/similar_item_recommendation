For Dane the only exciting thing about their new town is the beautiful girl next door, Julie Julie. (Haley Bennett). With Susan spending more and more time at work, Dane and Lucas are left unattended to explore the depths of their eerie new residence.

But then everything changes when they find a sinister bottomless hole under a locked trap door in the basement. As the brothers experiment with the hole they realize that the cold pit goes on forever. They drop a nail and never hear it hit bottom.

         "The Hole 3D (not to be confused with the Thora Birch vehicle of the same name from 2001) is a good old-fashioned horror yarn for youngsters. No gore, no nudity, just good scares! A grumpy teenager and his little brother move with their single mother to a small town. They soon befriend the beautiful girl next door and they happen across a giant, ominous hole in their basement. The hole is seemingly infinite as the boys conduct a series of experiments including lowering a night-vision camcorder down and throwing a handful of nails in (to tremendous 3D effect, as you can imagine). What they don't discover over the course of these experiments is that the hole, once opened, lets loose your greatest fear which then proceeds to stalk you. A simple setup, but it is used very well, not only for thrills but as a sometimes thought-provoking look at the fears that you don't realise you have. The very obvious but extremely effective \"evil clown doll\" is great for scares and a hammy throwback to old-school horror of The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits. The other \"fears\" are somewhat more cerebral and as the film progresses, some of the fun tends to get lost in the family issues storyline. However, it is a well-written piece and the script reveals drips of information at a suitably subtle pace. The young cast do very well in roles that should have been very annoying and there is an element of class to proceedings overall. While this is certainly not by any means an important or a very original film, it is great to see films aimed at kids that refuses to condescend to them. The Hole plays it for scares, and isn't afraid to do just that. Children will be terrified and delighted in equal measure. The 80's gave us kids' adventures that dripped with real danger like The Goonies or Labyrinth, and of course Joe Dante's Gremlins movies. These films were quite nasty, and unlike most of the saccharine rubbish kids are dealt these days, they are quite menacing. The Hole is a worthy successor to these films and isn't afraid to push your nerves just that little bit further than you might expect. From the poster and trailer I expected a tween adventure with a supernatural twist akin to Are You Afraid of the Dark or Goosebumps? To my delight, this was far more enjoyable than just a silly kids' film. It is certainly directed towards young teenagers but the great thing about The Hole is that it is actually scary! This film is full of menace but keeps the tone light enough to maintain the element of fun. Dante keeps you on the edge of your seat with constantly mounting tension and silly jumps that make the audience giggle as much as scream. This is as fun as horror gets and for once the gimmick of 3D is used as just that... a gimmick. Certainly not high-brow but lots of fun and scarier than you might expect!",
         "Fear and nostalgia don't often go hand in hand, but the two were riding high in my mind after the screening of The Hole. Coulrophobia, or a fear of clowns, seems to be quite a common phobia amongst my peers and for 99% of us it can be traced back to a certain television show. The Sky One adaptation of Stephen King's It, which aired in 1990. It's main antagonist, a clown named Pennywise, gave me my first real post-horror-film sleepless night. Up to that point the only fear-inducing villains I had been exposed to were Darth Vader and the Wicked Witch of the West. But a samurai robot and a middle-aged woman in green make-up didn't seem quite so scary after watching the terrifying killer clown. Echoes of Pennywise are evident in the ghoulish Jester doll of The Hole. The fact that Joe Dante brings us a family film that manages to instill some levels of discomfort and even fear in adults reminds us why he was such a big name in the 80's. With The Hole, the man behind Gremlins and The 'Burbs goe's back to what he does best; frightening yet family friendly. And he almost succeeds in giving us another great kids film. Almost. Featuring the aforementioned Jester doll, the corpse of a young girl and some Beetlejuice like nightmare sequences, there are a lot of horror elements of the film to like. These elements are executed well and the use of some traditional stop-motion special effects gave the film an endearing charm. However all of this just served to highlight how awful the 3D was. The digital effect only served to ruin what would otherwise have been a great thowback-to-the-80's look. I ended up watching the second half of The Hole with my Roy Orbison style specs removed. In my experience, and a lot of people I've discussed it with, the novelty of 3D lasts for roughly the first ten minutes of a film. Afterwards it simply distracts from whats going on and tends to blur any action above a certain speed. It adds nothing to the vast majority of the films released in the format and ultimately becomes headache inducing. Let's hope it's just a Smell-O-Vision style fad that fades away sooner rather than later. The storyline of The Hole is in no way original and the dialogue is ridiculously bad at times, but on the whole it had a certain charisma about it. Had this been released when I was between eight and twelve years of age it may have been a favourite of mine, along with Ghostbusters and two of Dante's other works Innerspace and Gremlins. It pushes the boundaries of whats acceptable in a film rated 12A, is nicely stylised and has genuinely frightening moments. For a certain age group in years to come, The Hole will evoke great memories of how much fun the cinema can be. If they happen to see a 2D version, all the better.",
         "My first encounter with the world of Joe Dante was almost twenty years ago when i caught a glimpse of Gremlins at the tender age of four. At the time I was horrified, but as I grew up it soon became one of my favourite films, instantly capable of transporting me back to a time when horror films used to scare me. I was hoping that Dante would be able to recapture this magic, and The Hole left me wishing that I was a pre-teen with a wild imagination once again, heading into a horror film for the very first time. This made me very jealous of the younger crowd in the audience as they were clearly stuck fast in their seats, horrified by the visions that unfolded before them - their silence spoke louder than any screams - and desperate for the frightening film to end. The nightmare begins when a single sprightly mother, her angst-ridden adolescent son Dane and nervous pre-teen Lucas move into a new house in a strange neighbourhood, only to discover a seemingly bottomless pit locked away under a trapdoor in the basement. Curiosity gets the better of the boys and it is not long before they lower a camera into the mysterious hole in an attempt to film the unknown, but, as video footage shows in one of the films eeriest moments, some things are better left undisturbed. After exploring the darkness underneath the trapdoor, the boys begin to be haunted by strange events, with the hole seemingly preying on their individual fears. This provides the basis for a number of scary moments which are quite effective considering The hole is aimed at a younger audience, but it is unlikely to have any impact on those familiar with recent scary films such as REC and Paranormal Activity. The story still remains intriguing enough to keep older viewers entertained for the most part, and could well bring back long forgotten memories of their first encounters with the world of the supernatural films. Horror fans hoping for a repeat of Gremlins will be disappointed, but that's not to say that The Hole should be dismissed; its constant references to classic horror films cannot replace the dark, warped humour that made Gremlins so watchable, but certainly adds to the experience for fans of the genre. Numerous scenes invoke connections to Poltergeist and The Gate, with the icing on the cake being a homage to the Hands of Orlac - a very under-rated thriller from 1935 - that I imagine will pass by unnoticed by the majority of viewers due to unfamiliarity with the source material, and they all serve to remind us that Dante is an ardent horror fan and is not afraid to wear his influences on his sleeve. As a children's horror film The Hole is excellent but unfortunately it fails to surpass the genre classics such as A nightmare before Christmas and Gremlins due to the lack of appeal to an older audience. The story is fairly entertaining and the references to cult classics are a great addition to the film but they are simply not enough to keep older viewers fully engrossed for the ninety minutes running time. I would definitely recommend this film to families with young teenagers and children eager to be scared, as The Hole is a perfect introduction to horror films for those easily scared, and one of Joe Dante's more accomplished directorial efforts. 6/10 If you like this you will enjoy these: The Gate Paperhouse Poltergeist Gremlins",
         "This movie can easily be summarized: it is like a movie version of a Goosebumps children's \"horror\" story. Anyone familiar with the Goosebumps book series will know what I mean. This movie is a \"horror\" movie for young teens and families with children. I watched it without knowing this, and was in for a surprise. Now, don't get me wrong, this is still a good movie. But if you are expecting to be scared, you are better off watching something more tailored for an adult audience. I am sure lots of the youngsters will find this movie freakishly scary though. There are scenes that might scare younger audiences out of their pants, but at the same time, the movie is still kept at a level where it can be considered suitable for family entertainment somehow. I know it sounds weird, but if you watch the movie, you will know what I mean. There were some good parts in the movie, but nothing that made me spooked or disturbed. The clown here reminded me somewhat of a mix of the clown doll from \"Poltergeist\" mixed with Chucky, and it did work well enough. The effects were good and believable, without being over the top. The movie is not running on special effects, but whatever effects there were being used were straight to the point. And also the people in the movie put on good performances, and that helped the movie along a good long way. And I think the young actors and actress help appeal to the younger audience. This movie is suitable for a good evening of slight scares for families and younger teens. Worth the time actually, if you have nothing better to do.",
         "There's a handful of directors who stand as tall as Joe Dante when it comes to movies a kid/teen growing in the 80s grew up with. Joe Dante is a legend, directing such classics as The Gremlins, Explorers, Innerspace, The 'burbs and co-directing Twilight Zone the Movie and Amazon Women on the Moon. Such nostalgia, but like many of his contemporaries, he didn't really make anything noteworthy after those. Needless to say I was still looking forward to seeing The Hole, which in paper looked like he was kind of returning to his forte - sort of family horror comedy. And that's exactly what it was! I'm already out of the target group, but still I really enjoyed the movie. It's finally a Joe Dante movie that we've been waiting for a long time. The story is great, a mystery Hole in the floor. Quite a few clichéd horror moments, but that's totally fine, clichés are OK when you do it tongue in cheek and not too seriously. Still I must say I was a bit surprised how tense it got here and there. Spooky stuff. One of the only real gripes with this movie is the fact that it looks a bit low budget (I'm not sure if 10 mil qualifies as a low budget, it's an awful lot of money). It's got a bit of a TV movie feel. No big stars, good looking but rather small scale sets. Still old Dante fans will love a few cameos and familiar faces. Other gripe with the movie is that I don't find Chris Massoglias characters very likable. I didn't like him in Cirque du Freak and neither in this movie. The kid brother was so much better actor creating a much more likable character. Having also seen John Carpenters return movie \"The Ward\", I'd have to say Dante won this round. I hope these two 80s superstars will still return to form with a real big budget movie showing the younger directors what they're really made of.",
         "The great thing about Dante's latest feature (his first in 7 years) is that it's so disarming. The look, feel and tone all tells you this a family-friendly kids flick, in the same vane as The Goonies and Explorers. In fact, I first heard this movie pitched as a gentle introduction to horror for tweens. This film, however, is definitely not suitable for a 12 year old. Dante is renowned for having his tongue lodged firmly in his cheek, his movies very much anarchic in tone and content (Gremlins being a perfect example). The Hole is much more tempered than this, and the first two thirds are a genuine masterclass in ratcheting up fear and tension. Sure, there are plenty of jump shocks, but Dante cleverly places his camera close to the characters, leaving most of the background hidden so you never see what's coming. The lead characters are all very good, and the initial scenes with Dane and the girl-next-door feel realistically stilted (as you would if you were a teenager and you just met the cute babe next door). Dante doesn't hang about, and quickly gets to the hole. This in turn immediately opens up all manner of scares, with some dark and genuinely frightening scenes, extremely well executed. Dante borrows heavily from the likes of The Grudge, Poltergeist and The Sixth Sense, as well as affectionate nods to his own films (Gremlins, Small Soldiers and even It's A Good Life, a segment he directed for Twilight Zone The Movie). However, none of it feels ripped-off. It has its own inimitable style and is expertly put together, complementing the story. For me, the final act was a little wacky but the overall movie is a satisfying experience. Considering its influences and the fact that Dante has been in the game for over 30 years, this is a surprisingly fresh addition to the genre.",
         "Do not read if you didn't watch the movie. I give many spoilers. =============================================================== That being said, contrary to the majority, I find this movie really poor. I've just watched it and write my review still warm. To many stereotypes. The neighbor girl, whose swimming pool at night is covered with beautiful girls and boys having a very fun party. The two boys who are in conflict with their divorced mother. Each time there is a intense scary scene with loud music, you are sure to have someone putting his hand on the shoulder saying \"hey, what's the matter? Are you all right?\". By doing that we are all surprised and jump on our seat, well, this is what the director tried us to do. This kind of trick is very well known nowadays so one time is OK, two becomes a lot and three we are really bored. So the beginning of the movie is OK despite some stereotype things, the action intense, you really wonder what is under that bottomless hole. The idea of using a long rope thrown in it and that is cut without warning, well, you wonder what is it. Throwing nails and no sound is heard, very odd and scary. Where this hole is connected to? Using that fishing rod, great too, it seems endless. But the very good idea, top of the top is the camcorder. However there is a contradiction in that. The two boys and the girl have just use a rope, it breaks. A fishing rod, it breaks too. And they use their own video camcorder and put it along a rope too? They are not afraid to lose it? Well, you see what I mean, I would have never did that. But well, it is a movie and we have to move on. So they don't go deep, they get back the camcorder, they watch what it has filmed, nothing, dark with some sparks. Then the mother enters, everybody turn to her and only her see an eye on the TV, wondering what it is. This is GREAT !!!!!! This is great and scary, you really start to become scary and upset and you start to feel not very good. As for myself, I started to look under my seat to see if any monster was under. Then at night the girl on her bed, hearing some far and low voice, good. The little boy attacked by the puppet in the basement, good. But then it starts to become poor and poor. Imagine you are the little boy, imagine you live what he lived, would you be laughing? Would you go back to the basement at night with your brother and the neighbor girl with Christmas lamp everywhere, waiting for the return of the girl everybody saw? Why do they hide this to their mother? Wouldn't you share your feelings, your fear with your loved mother if you lived such terrible moments? Please, all those teenagers have just witnessed a little girl in bad condition and crying blood, in toilets, in home, telling them she doesn't want to die, then going back crawling to the hole and everybody continue his own life? I would call the army but all of them just sit in front of the hole, joking. Please !!!!! So maybe teenagers and under find such a movie entertaining and scary but once you are over 20, it simply becomes a comedy instead of a terror movie. And the policeman, head shot, him too crawling into the hole and the boys behaving almost like normal, barely scared. No please, how do you want to quiver? At the beginning you are quivering but the more you move on, the less you are afraid and the disappointment increase proportionally. As for the end, the jump in the hole, the fight with the father, really ridiculous. Past the middle of the movie, it is boring, the end is stupid. So all in all, don't waste your money for that movie. Watch it free if you have the opportunity (free theater ticket, etc...), otherwise avoid it.",
         "\"You've got a gateway to hell under your house and that's really cool.\" Susan (Polo) and her sons Dane (Massoglia) & Lucas (Gamble) have just moved into a new house. Dane is upset about having to move again and that isn't helping to make the move easy. When he meets the girl next door he finally has a friend and they start to explore the house. When the stumble upon a door in the floor of their basement then unknowingly open a gateway to hell and become haunted by their darkest fears. Going in I honestly expected this to be a cheesy teen-ager type horror. While it was geared toward teens this movie was actually not bad at all. This is a horror movie but it's done by the same director of the \"Gremlins\" movies so it's not scary scary but it is very entertaining and fast paced. There are quite a bit of disturbing scenes and images in this but nothing that will keep you up with nightmares so that is always good. The movie was made a few years ago and just now getting released but I would compare this to \"Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark\" in terms of plot and idea. If you liked that movie you will like this one too. I enjoyed it. Overall, an entertaining and a little creepy movie that was much better then I expected. I give it a B+.",
         "Gremlins remains one of my favourite films from childhood, and it is thanks to Joe Dante who helmed the films with enough to keep it frightening, yet kid friendly and family oriented at the same time. It's been a long while since I've missed Small Soldiers on the big screen, that he now returns with The Hole, yet dabbling with a similar treatment of making it quite the entertaining romp for both young and old to sit through. A pity about the 3D version though, as I opted to watch this in 2D, and clearly because of the 3D gimmick, there were a few needless scenes stuck in, like having a kid throw a baseball toward the screen while lying on his back on his bed. On the whole there weren't too many deliberate 3D shots designed for the film, though I thought that the special effects put into it were spiffy enough, especially since there was a good mix of traditional stop motion efforts deliberate done in a cheesy manner, and those of the modern money shots toward the end. As it's family oriented, this film like the rest of what Dante did thus far, has family being in the centre of all things that trip up in the dark, and we get three stories put into one, by virtue of each character having to deal with their fears come alive. Written by Mark L. Smith (Vacancy), the narrative keeps you guessing exactly what the reason is behind the threats are as faced by each child/teenage lead in the Thompson brothers Dane (Chris Massoglia) and Lucas (Nathan Gamble), and their neighbour Julie (Haley Bennett) when they look down the cursed hole, found in the new home of the Thompsons. The idea is pretty cool in itself, because what could spook you more than what's truly your greatest fear? However that itself served up a mixed bag of scares, because the scares here are customized to the character's. For instance, Lucas has to deal with something straight out of Child's Play, although this little thingamajig had a small scene as a stinger after the end credits (well, if you have to know, it's only a wink, so you didn't miss much if you failed to stay behind). For Julie, it has to deal with a guilt from the past that manifest itself as something spiritual, and to face one's guilt is something that takes up her story arc. For Dane's however, it was kept under wraps until the last, which provided for a fitting finale with all the bells and whistles thrown in, dealing with how the magnitude of one's problems when young seem to shrink in size as we grow older, possibly because we may either have outgrown it, or that being older we have a lot more other concerns to deal, in his case, the growing into a surrogate paternal role over the care of his younger brother, in a single parent family. Still, despite being a horror/thriller, this is still something that will find a broad appeal, being somewhat simple in its stories, but nothing less than effective and of course for those catching it in 3D, yet another film to provide you that fixation with putting on the glasses. I'm not quite sure if a sequel would be made given the way it ended with a plot thread so glaringly hanging out, but we know how Gremlins 2 went.",
         "Joe Dante is finally back with a feature film after 'Looney Tunes: Back in Action' (2003), a very long break only interrupted by the occasional TV work. As my fellow reviewer mentioned, 'The Hole' is currently on general release in Thailand (Dolby 3D only). I watched it today. 'The Hole' has what you can expect from PG-13 horror. Think 'Poltergeist' (from which it borrows a plot device). The scares are mild, there is only one slightly gory scene. Atmosphere and story are fine. I cannot comment on the quality of the 3D effects as I don't have 3D vision. You can expect a lot of character scenes that establish the story as well as scenes obviously designed to show off the technology, including underwater sequences. If you like Joe Dante's work and don't need ultra-brutal horror, you may well enjoy 'The Hole'. I'm happy to report that Dick Miller has the expected (very short) cameo."
