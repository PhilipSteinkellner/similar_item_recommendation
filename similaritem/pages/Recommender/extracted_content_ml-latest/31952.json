      "synopsis": "The film starts with a real life manager of Budapest metro system explaining that the events shown in the film are purely fictional and have no bearing on the conduct and practices of the 'Kontrollers' of the Budapest metro system. Bulcsú (Sándor Csányi) is a ticket inspector on the Hungarian Metro. He spends his nights sleeping on the train platforms, and hasn't left the underground ever since he started working there. His ragtag team of inspectors - consisting of the veteran Professor (Zoltán Mucsi), the disheveled Lecsó (Sándor Badár), neurotic narcoleptic Muki (Csaba Pindroch) and dimwitted greenhorn Tibi (Zsolt Nagy) - are routinely disrespected and assaulted by the commuters, who continue to evade paying fines in a variety of ways. One of Bulcsú's company rivals, model employee Gonzó (Balázs Mihályfi) challenges him to a \"rail run\": after the last metro leaves a station, the two get on the tracks and try to make it to the next station on foot before the midnight maintenance carriage runs them over. Bulcsú wins the contest, barely saving Gonzó in the last second. During a routine inspection, he is enamored by a girl dressed in a bear suit called Zsófi (Eszter Balla), the daughter of one of the veteran metro drivers, Béla (Lajos Kovács). In another occasion, Bulcsú unsuccessfully attempts to talk his collague Laci (László Nádasi) out of a hostage situation when Laci goes postal after he gets into an altercation with a passenger; Laci exclaims he can't take it anymore and slits the passenger's throat. After chasing a repeat offending prankster called Bootsie (Bence Mátyássy), Bulcsú witnesses him being pushed on the tracks by a hooded figure, dressed in exactly the same attire as him; another incident in a long line of what people thought were apparent suicides. Because of his recurring nightmare of this figure, Bulcsú fails to apprehend the murderer, and when he's brought to questioning, he refuses to disclose details of the incident to the lead executive (György Cserhalmi) of the company. When the executive threatens to disclose the video footage of the incident, which only shows Bulcsú, he resigns his job. Muki later insinuates him being the murderer, citing his continual nightly absence and accusing him of having the same mental issues as Laci did; an infuriated Bulcsú almost pushes him on the tracks as well. During an underground costume party, Bulcsú spots and follows the hooded figure and they get into an altercation, after which they start rail running similarly to the contest with Gonzó earlier. Bulcsú wins again; the hooded figure never emerges from the tracks. Bulcsú meets Zsófi, who is now dressed as a butterfly, and the two finally emerge back to the surface.",

         "KONTROLL is a Hungarian film from director Nimród Antal. Yes, that's really his name. The first thing he did when he introduced the film was make fun of the fact that he was called Nimrod, which is great. The film is about a group of ticket inspectors in the Hungarian subway system, with the focus on at least one in particular (Bulcsú). Each character is extremely likable, even the passengers become memorable characters, as none of them buy a ticket and are chased or shaken down by the inspectors, which is commonplace in Hungary. There is even a young girl in a bear suit (don't ask) that is absolutely gorgeous. The interaction between her and Bulcsú is sweet and funny. They had the kind of chemistry that is difficult to capture on film. The entire film takes place in the underground, which is effectively presented as a separate world than the one above ground. Some characters even talk about \"up there\" with a child- like wonder in their voices. The cinematography is beautiful. Some of the scenes or long panning shots in the underground are breathtaking. Who'd a thunk it'd look so cool down there? You can tell the director has a photography background, by the wonderful shots he selected. I was also pleasantly surprised by the rockin' soundtrack. Unfortunately, the band that did the music (NEO) are no longer together. Lets hope the director gets the soundtrack released. This film is not all laughs however. It has a very serious side that is dark, and an ending that makes you think. If this is the kind of film we can expect from Hungary, I'm eagerly anticipating more. I definitely recommend this film. (8/10)",
         "\"Kontroll\" gives me new hope that Hungarian filmmakers are finally capable to make pictures that appeal to audiences at home, movie critics (and probably also foreign audiences) alike. An excellent, though a bit weird mixture of satirical comedy, mystical drama and thriller. The metro stations become a world of their own, the neon lights create a new reality. While in the beginning the film focuses on a whole group of ticket controllers and we expect a satirical comedy about their lives, in the second half the storyline concentrates on the terrifying experiences of Bulcsú, a man with a mysterious past. He used to be an artist or in some other kind of creative business not specified further, but left this life for unknown reasons and started to live in the metro. It also becomes clear that for some reason he is not able to leave the metro system until the end - when he overcomes the dark forces (that probably have also been lurking inside him). Everything about this story is deeply irrational (except for the satirical elements that are in some ways very close to reality :-)), this is just a terrible world, where love means the only hope (I was a bit reminded of Terry Gilliam's \"Brazil\"). An excellent movie that I would also strongly recommend to foreign viewers. I don't know if this will ever come to other countries, but I would very much like it to be so. So that Hungary could be put back on the landscape of international moviemaking. P.s.: The Budapest multiplex I saw this in was absolutely packed with people. I was astonished what a great success \"Kontroll\" has become in Hungary, because I think that most people in the audience there have probably never seen anything that could only remotely be called arthouse - and \"Kontroll\" wasn't exactly an easy popcorn movie....",
         "I think, it's one of the best Hungarian films what had been ever made. Bulcsú's character is very good, and Kovács Lajos (the drunken metro driver) is a great actor, the story is exciting, and the pictures have very dark feelings, so it's a perfect film from a genius director, Antal Nimród. The story is very dark, and grabs your deep inner frightens. And it shows you the real world of Budapest subway, it's the same that you see in the film, expect the shadow murderer with the hood. Csányi Sándor's first main role wasn't too difficult for this fantastic young talent, he did his performances more perfect than the perfect. If you aren't a ticket inspector, or a subway passenger, you should watch this film. I can recommend it to everybody. (sorry for my poor English, but I haven't got a language exam yet :-) )",
         "This is just an amazing and wonderful film. It's funny, romantic, creepy, exciting and thought provoking. Too bad this weekend people are lining up to see A Lot Like Love. The photography is dazzling, the music heart pounding, the acting is masterful... It's been a while since i enjoyed a movie this much. Hope you get a chance to see this, you won't regret it. The movie is a very strange and quirky dark tale of a bunch of outcasts that spend their time working as ticket inspectors in the subway, but their leader is a haunting and charming guy that is obviously dealing with his demons and has exiled himself to the subway. In his quest for finding life again, so much stuff happens. The story is beautiful, but pretty dark and creepy at times, and the romantic plot between him and the gorgeous teddy bear girl in which both share their \"outcastness\" is perfect. Please go see this, you deserve it.",
         "CONTROL (Nimród Antal - Hungary 2003). The film opens with a prologue featuring a real-life Budapest metro official declaring this film is in no way representative of Budapest's underground system, but nevertheless he's in full support (!) of this feature. Probably enscenated by the director, or he must be one hell of a charming fellow to convince the underground authorities in Budapest to allow this kind of endorsement. This is a smart film. A cynical blender of genres and styles, completely in tune with the 21th century world of chaos, anarchy, despair and poverty we live in. It's a modern language. If this was American, it would define a generation. I'm positive it had this effect on many young Hungarians. We have a closely confined space here: The Budapest underground rail system. Bulcsú, our main protagonist, is a controller in the Budapest metro. That's his job, leading a motley bunch of rival ticket inspectors. The film never comes above ground. Bulcsú never even leaves the system. He sleeps on the platforms, all he seems to eat or drink is coffee from the machines on the platforms. God knows what he lives on. The crucial part is in the second half when Bulcsú meets an acquaintance of him on the platform, an middle-aged man who seems like a former professor of him or some kind of mentor. He is clearly embarrassed to run into him in the state he's in. What is it he's hiding from? He seems a well-educated young man. His acquaintance speaks of the promising young Bulcsú. Was he a promising scientist? What was his life like prior to the hellish job he does now? The rest, the extremely aggressive and unwilling passengers, rivalry among colleague ticket inspectors, even a shadowy serial killer who pushes unsuspecting travelers before trains, it's all a sideshow, but a brilliant one. The perfect backdrop for his troubled existence. Sándor Csányi gives a brilliantly understated performance, perfectly in tune with the daylight-ridden world he lives in. The silent scene where Bulcsú sits on a large ventilator shaft, echos Ridley Scott, a kind of existential ALIEN-film. Long tracking shots, a neon-lit world, an energetic techno-driven soundtrack. One can argue about the choice of music, the moral stance of the incredibly aggressive passengers but all is perfectly on par with the director's visual ideas. This director is in total control and knows how to express his ideas on film. Very impressive, make sure you see this. A small side-note: Nimród Antal, who grew up in LA, is currently finishing his latest film VACANCY, starring Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson, scheduled for US release on 20 April 2007 and, I can hardly believe it, a cinematic release in the Netherlands as well, scheduled for 19 July 2007). I expect the worst and hope for the best. Camera Obscura --- 10/10",
         "This is such a great film from a first time director. This movie makes you fall in love with the character and actually care whats going on in his life. And they do this with great music, funny situations, and some fun action scenes. This is definitely a treat if you can find it somewhere. This is one of my favorite films that has been shown at south by southwest, it goes along side The Thing About my Folks, and Palindromes. I can't wait until this comes out to DVD in America, i am definitely going to buy this film. Overall i give it a 9.1 of 10. Don't mess out on a chance to watch this movie. .",
         "What an unexpected pleasure! It doesn't happen very often to me that I go watch a movie completely in the dark; when I do, it's usually because somebody dragged me to it - as was the case here - and more often than not, I regret it afterwards. This was a very welcome exception. What a find! This movie has simply everything: great characters, superb cinematography, a kick-ass soundtrack; it's a comedy, a mystery thriller, a drama and a romance - and the performances and the direction are flawless. The main storyline follows Bulcsù, who is a ticket inspector for the Budapest subway. He lives in the dark, depressing tunnels below the city and never leaves them, having chosen his own personal hell after a life above which he seems to desperately want to forget. Bulcsù is a very ambiguous character and it's precisely the ambiguity and the symbolism of his story which make this film stand out for me. You have to fill in a lot of the blanks yourself and the further the story progresses, the more you're left wondering and guessing. I will not spoil anything here, but what makes me call this film great instead of just very good, is that there is a wide range of different interpretations possible for this marvelous movie, from the mainstream one to the dark and disturbing or even the religious - and they all work beautifully. Great, smart entertainment and outstanding cinema. 10 out of 10.

         "for the first time again since Avalon I felt completely lifted to another world... I didn't know what to expect when I decided to watch this one tonight as opener for the Fantasy Film Fest in Hamburg... I was skeptical since the last openers were highly promoted but quite dull... This one is different... A team of very different persons work together as ticket inspectors... each of them is differently weird but fun to watch... The whole movie happens in the subway and stations... no daylight... The images are great and the music fits perfectly to this extraordinary composition. Just don't ask what this movie is about... or if there is a story being told... I don't know... I don't care... I loved to watch and I hope to join this ride soon again...",
         "I can't wait to see this film again! There is a DVD coming out with Canadian distrib. ThinkFilm in the 1st quarter of 2005...i can't wait this long!!! Gah! The director was there for a Q&A after the film, and was wonderful to talk to (which is always a nice surprise). He told me that they got the high contrast look with a 'bleach-bypass' developing of the film, and it amplified the beautiful camera work. First review says it all, gorgeous cinematography, great directing, great acting, great story. The lead actor also had the most incredible screen presence. I couldn't tear my eyes off his performance once, i hope he continues in the business with much success. I'd also keep my eyes on the other actors, as they were all fantastic. -cheers.",
         "At long last there is an excellent, competitive Hungarian movie about different ways of the ego and soul, about love and crime and the background there is symbolic world of subway. I really enjoyed the characters because they all are basic symbols of our life. There is the good, the bad, the lover, the friend and so many characters who can help the protagonist to reach his right way of self-realization and in the other hand there are the dark forces, all those who try to balk our hero to reach the glory. But what the glory really is? It's always personal and different. The same in all ways is to make the dream true. Our hero can beat his evil instincts with love and reach the glory (and to be able to make his dreams true). After all I really enjoyed Nimród Antal first movie and my advice is the next: U have to see it!"

         "Ghost trains and ghostly characters, figuratively speaking of course, are what run through the perpetual night of this underground metro system. Bulcsú's (Sándor Csányi) life that once was, on the surface, where the real people go home after work, who go to the movies or a fine restaurant is now replaced by the dark, cold and solitude arena of his new dwellings. He, and his motley crew of ragtag metro ticket Kontrollers must patrol the trains that run these City dwellers back and forth and with daily ritual, check that no one dare come down into their world for a free ride. With indifferent passengers, a possible love interest, a regime set on competition and to top it all a mysterious serial killer at large, Kontroll is a dark and bleak comedy of the world of the ticket inspector, who, in the end must keep this Metro system running. If not, what would be the worst that could happen, if they ever lost control? Dare you ride here for free, too?",
         "The massive labyrinthine netherworld that is the Budapest subway system provides the stunning setting for 'Kontroll,' a high-style, high-speed romantic thriller in which the lives of assorted outcasts, lovers, and dreamers intersect and collide. One handsome young hero, one mysterious maiden, and one particularly nasty killer must conduct a race against time, trains, and destiny itself in their frantic pursuit of one another.",
