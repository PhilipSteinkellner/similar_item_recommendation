         "The fifth installment of Step Up is back in \"Step Up: All In\" with introducing more inventive choreography from expert dancer crews and containing almost all-star member of the series (minus Channing Tatum of course) into a dance competition in L.A. The movie brings a first class and entertaining show that is wanted from their fans. All the dances and flash mob are taken beautifully that has already been a trademark from all the series and what differentiates it from other dance movie. Unfortunately there's a contrary and unbalanced between dance and whole elements in this movie. \"Step Up: All in\" suffers with mediocre yet predictable storyline, horrible written script, forgettable chemistry and some average acting from it's entire casts. The movie focuses only on the Vortex competition and how their ambition and preparations to win this thing without care less about anything that would bring boring moments and reduce emotional feelings for the character itself. In other words, this film felt stunning when it related to massive movements with loud R&B soundtrack mixed but once it touches drama and storytelling stuff, it's just that awful. Overall, \"Step Up: All In\" isn't a game-changer of the series, in fact it's definitely just a similar movie from the previous franchise with this time L.A as the background. It shows never-ending competition that is so exhausting to see, but as long as it still delivers spectacle and great moves, it seems would satisfy it's fans and safely stick them from their seats until end credits appear.",
         "One of these days Step Up will realize that it's better for the characters to just whimsically dance like in old musical movie without forcing an already stagnant plot. The movie boasts a dynamic choreography and stellar music to go with it, some are timed just right and they are admittedly entertaining. It commendably tries to bring a dancer's perspective on their life style and tribulation, but the plot often contradicts the effort by putting overly flamboyant characters or tired plot. In the end it's just another drawn out excuse for a dance battle, albeit a rather spectacular one. Story revolves around characters from previous installments, collaborating to make a crew to win the high stake dance competition. No Channing Tatum though. If this sounds familiar, it is. There are monetary issues, personal issues and dances in between. For what it's worth, the two leads try to bring more emotion to the mix, although only a few good moments come out of it. Adam Sevani (Moose) is a star, the uncrowned lead of the series. It's quiet amazing that his side story resonates more than the actual main plot. Problem arises when the movie attempts to exaggerate flamboyant lifestyle, especially those of celebrity's and their reality television. It's far from witty; in fact the humor tends to fall and becomes tiresome to watch. The main antagonists are mediocre unsavory characters; the male is copied directly from the typical random thug that messes with Chuck Norris or Steven Seagal at a bar, while the female is a botched version of Stanley Tucci's character from Hunger Games. When the characters don't banter they perform well. Using odd props and good dance moves, they manage to produce a spectacle. Most of the cast are primarily dancers, so they convince the audience better using motion than poorly written script. Wardrobe looks good, each dance is represented with unique costume, the steampunk one is particularly exceptional. With simple yet effective effect, these dance sequences are the heights of the movie. Like any other installments, the plot is almost a hindrance as audience waits for another dance scene to erupt. It does try to make audience relate, although it misses the mark more often than not, which is a shame since it invests plenty of time for it. The glossy choreograph and heart-thumping soundtracks present an enjoyable light flick, and to be fair it's what viewer would expect, but sadly nothing more.",
         "Don't be fooled. This is not an actual movie. It is a dancing show! The plot is minimal and cheesy. Young people who want to have a chance to fame while doing what they love most. Dancing. Any other plot elements like a couple of small dramas are short-lived and superficial. Soooo, it all about modern dance. Pop music, hip-hop, breakdance. In that department the \"movie\" is OK. If you aren't too much into it, you may find your self bored near the end since the later moves are not better than those at the beginning of th movie. This is the 5th part of a series of films, but it doesn't matter if you missed the previous ones. Overall a dance spectacle more than a movie with lots of modern music and some fancy acrobatic moves.",
         "Everything about this movie sucked. Well, everything but the camera work. Acting is horrible, the whole movie is illogical. Breaking into dancing wherever - cops, security don't care. The forced drama and childish behavior (did I mention poor acting?). Prior installments were at least somewhat realistic, you had a connection with the main character(s).. Not here. everything is just lumped into one big mess of \"big show\".. and what's up with the Girl on Fire references? Couldn't come up with something better? very sad that we paid to see this garbage",
         "everything apart from the dance at moose's work place and the one at the very end this film is just so so bad. the terrible directing and messed up editing just make it feel like key parts have been left out for no apparent reason, and as for the blatant theft of scenes from countless other films like eminem on the bus in 8 mile, with the hoody on an music playing as it drives along montage style, and many others that i just cba to mention, just makes watching this un-original an clichéd film unbearable. the one an only reason i watched it to the end was to see what sexy costume briana evigan was gona be wearing in the her next scene, other than that its total pap",
         "Sweet baby Jesus, lord Christ almighty, WHY DO THEY KEEP ON MAKING DANCE MOVIES? THEY ARE ALL exactly THE SAME. let me illustrate... girl moves to new city, girl meets boy, girl likes dance,boy likes girl, girl plays hard to get.. every dances in some stupid competition, girl and boy end up together... does this ring a bell??? THEY ARE ALL THE SAME.. IDENTICAL.. NO VARIANCE. WHY DO they KEEP ON MAKING DANCE MOVIES.. THERE IS Nothing THAT THEY CAN SHOW THE AUDIENCE THAT HAS NOT ALREADY BEEN DONE.. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN... Please stop making these movies. You already stepped in a toilet already.",
         "I was having a good time watching this,just like the feeling i had watching the previous one. Despite the lack of storytelling -which i didn't really expect about it- the dancing scenes were all amazing and satisfying for all step up fans.If they add water and electric element to their dance moves on the previous movies,now they bring fire,sand,and wind -yes,lots of wind-.The thing i like the most is that the crews are back,your favourite characters like moose,jenny kido,and andie.Thats what keeps me excited watching this movie,and as a step up fan,im really satisfied.The final dance was breathtaking and excellent.i couldn't stop listening to the soundtracks now.If you like to dance and a feel-good movie,watch this one.",
         "Step up All In is yet another failed attempt at making a feature film simply by showcasing dancing talent. Well-choreographed movement was also lacking throughout, although it endeavoured to entertain in the last 15 minutes, and succeeded. The progression of the \"story\" was constantly skipping over entire moments, with as little as one sentence or a voice-over to catch the audience up to speed. Unfortunately the acting was laughable, and not during intentionally comedic dialogue. There were some good sporadic dance sequences intertwined between weak performances from all involved. The only breath of fresh air was \"Moose\" (Adam Sevani) and his beautiful parents, which added the humility needed to make any of these plot progressions believable. For fans of this franchise it may have managed to reach expectations, although even they may tire of this regurgitated story and predictability. In this over saturated dance-battle-extravaganza market �� it's time to step down. */5 ***/10 By Rocio Belinda Mendez",
         "I will admit I was nervous, being a Step Up fan, that this was going to suck! Fortunately, it doesn't at all. It's fun,the music is great, and the end is maybe the best dance sequence of any of the films! I brought a couple of people with me to the movie that were not STEP UP fans and they sincerely thought it was good. O.K., the acting is poor, but you expect that ( to a certain extent) in films like this. But who cares? It adds to the campy love of the films. It's a fun movie and I love the fact they brought back many of the characters form the earlier films. If this doesn't succeed financially, it will be a shame. It's better than a lot of movies out there!",
         "How did a movie which received generally mediocre reviews on release spawn an entire franchise? That's a weighty question about the foibles and excesses of Hollywood that you can ponder while watching Step Up All In, the fifth Step Up movie about a boy and a girl finding love amidst the dance-breaks. As you might expect, it's as formulaic as they come, with some decently-choreographed dance sequences that break up the monotony of the film's so-called 'plot'. Sean (Ryan Guzman) just wants to make a living as a dancer, but he and his crew - the Mob - keep coming up empty at auditions. When everyone else in the Mob finally decides to pack up and head back to Miami, Sean stays in LA and resolves to enter The Vortex - a spectacular dance competition that will guarantee its winners a three-year show in Las Vegas. Sean sets out to find a new group of dancers, including opinionated Andie (Briana Evigan), even as his buddy Moose (Adam Sevani) wavers between his steady job as an engineer and his own desire to cut loose on the dance-floor. But, once LMNTRIX is formed and makes it into the finals of The Vortex, Sean's single-minded devotion to winning starts to create tensions within the new group. Along the way, there's shady Vortex host Alexxa Brava (Izabella Miko) and nominal villain Jasper (Stephen Jones), a conspiracy to rig the competition, and a budding romance - obviously - between Sean and the sensitive Andie, who doesn't want to win so much as just enjoy her time with her new dance crew. But it's all largely window dressing, packed around a hugely predictable plot. Group members pull out for personal reasons and return triumphantly at the last minute, characters learn lessons about finding your own kind of victory in a difficult world, people dance to fall in love and forget their problems. The cast is mostly dutiful, yet lacks the spark and charm that so evidently set Channing Tatum on his route to stardom after the original Step Up. Guzman is handsome but, in playing his pivotal role, doesn't manage to muster up much in the way of emotion. Evigan is more effective as Andie, hinting a little at the tragedies and pain that go into dancing everyday for a living, while Sevani provides good comic support as Moose. At least the dancing is fun to watch. Every so often, characters stop to cut a rug, and some of it is genuinely quite thrilling. The final performance by LMNTRIX (and others) is a spectacular choreography blow- out that gleefully encompasses everything from sand and fire to acrobatics, even as it wraps everything up in a pretty, predictable bow. If you're looking for revolutionary, thought-provoking cinema, Step Up All In is very much not the movie for you. This is fluff of the first order - and not even of the first grade - that might occasionally entertain the unconverted and will certainly thrill long-time fans, but is unlikely to do a great deal more than that."
