I'm gonna skip right over all of that and talk purely about the movie itself.\r\n\r\nAnya Taylor-Joy is good, but McAvoy is what makes Split worthwhile. The heavily touted twist/reveal was all but a non-event, even to a M. Night alum like myself. Though it is certainly (in my opinion) the best work The Shamhammer has brought out since at least Signs, it's hard to say that its successes rest on his shoulders. Again, it is for McAvoy that we really owe praise, who, with the exception of his role as the lead in Filth, gives his career best performance.\r\n\r\nFinal rating:★★★ - I personally recommend you give it a go.",

But the trailers looked great and I had always thought James McAvoy was a seriously underrated actor. \r\n\r\nSplit surprised me. I loved this movie. Ann Taylor-Joy was decent in the film and the Dr was great, but McAvoy knocked it out of the park. Being able to portray all these different personalities with no props such as wigs or makeup shows his talent. It was amazing how one personality made you feel uneasy and perplexed and the next had you smiling and feeling like you were really staring at a strange child. Bravo McAvoy.\r\n\r\nThe twist at the end made me love this movie even more. Though I'm not sure if you can really cal it a twist. A \"reveal\" might be the better word for what the audience learns. Whatever you want to cal it, the reveal at the end made me excited to see what's next!\r\n\r\nThe only thing I didn't like about this film was  the unresolved conflict between Ann Taylor-Joy's character at the end of the film. \r\nBesides that, I loved it. Definitely worth watching.",

It was slightly above average but no whee near the quality of The Sixth Sence. I don't know why I keep watching his movies, probably hoping one will be the same extraordinary quality. With all the pre-release buzz I thought this was finally that movie. \r\n\r\nI was so disappointed. I rated it slightly lower than Unbreakable. I don't know exactly where it where it went off the rails, but it never held my attention (and I'm not ADHD- I sit though theee hours of a good bio pic. \r\n\r\nA good part of this was the girls trying asinine ways to escape; at other time we see McAvoy play several personalities half heartily. After all the award talk I expected a much better and diverse McAvoy. Sadly, just like the majority of Night's films he has his actors perform methodically. It actually felt McAlvoy was pushing his talents against the brick wall of what the director wanted.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't the only actor who underplayed the role. So did the doctor and the three teenage girls. First, after all these late night calls for extra appointment why didn't she get upset earlier or pull a personality up (which she has stated she can do) to discover the emergency instead of A casual bye--you-leave when another dominant personality shows up to the appointment.\r\n\r\nI rate this in the same category of Nights's films except the quality Sisth Sense and Devil, which he did not direct and only wrote the original story, \r\n\r\nAs for,the ending, I felt it was a cheap shot. If the point was they are in the same time, the message came across far too,strong. If it is a hitnt to an Unbreakable 2 I'll pass and see another big screen feature.",

Night Shyamalan's last good movie, in my opinion of course, was The Village, where he had control over his style.\r\n\r\nIn Split he tries to use the same formula, but it doesn't work. There was no build up in reveling the plot, and then when we get to the end the feeling I got was : \"Is that it ?\".\r\n\r\nSure all the actors were good, but that didn't make the experience for me any better.",

On the paper, it was a simple split personality disaster theme, but cinematically clicked so well. Firstly the performance of James McAvoy made this film a very success. I have seen his lots of films, but if I had to choose only one of his great, that's would be easily this one. A straightforward story, no complication to understand, or needed to explain everything it revolves. Then suddenly the final act turned into a different mode. With a twist, all comes to end.\r\n\r\nThe three teenage girls have been kidnapped at the beginning. Following that, the victims do not know the situation, but makes a couple of bad moves, except one girl. As the film progress, many secrets revealed to us, particularly about the kidnapper. It all developed to lead in one direction where an unimaginable thing going to happen. How and what result it brings told in the following parts.\r\n\r\nThe perspective of the story was not really a thing in this. That means it does not take sides, but gives you the option to choose. And most of the viewers would root for the weird girl. It was Anya, and she's having a wonderful career in early stage. Could becomes one of the best if she contributed all her performances in the same pace and intensity. The music was equally awesome. Created the perfect atmosphere along with the visuals. I could have not asked the better one. Best thriller of the year. You will be stupid to miss it out if you love films.\r\n\r\n_8/10_",

      "synopsis": "The film opens with a birthday party for Claire (Haley Lu Richardson). Her classmate Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) was invited out of pity, as Claire tells her father (Neal Huff) that Casey frequently gets into trouble with teachers and gets sent to detention. Casey calls for a ride home but is told the car broke down. She's about to take the bus, but Claire's dad insists that she go home with them. The girls leave along with another friend, Marcia (Jessica Sula). Claire's dad is approached by an unseen person. Moments later, the person, a man named Kevin (James McAvoy), gets into the car. Claire thinks he just got in the wrong car by mistake, but Kevin puts on a face mask and sprays the girls with some kind of toxin that knocks them out. Casey slowly attempts to open the door to get out, but Kevin gets her too. Kevin brings the girls into a windowless room in an unknown location. He pulls Marcia out and takes her outside. After a brief moment, Marcia runs back into the room after she peed herself. She tells the others that Kevin wanted her to dance for him. Claire says they need to fight back together to get out. Casey is calm and says they need to find out what they are there for before they make any sort of move. We see a flashback in which a 5-year-old Casey (here played by Izzie Leigh Coffey) is with her father (Sebastian Arcelus) and her Uncle John (Brad William Henke). They are both hunters, and they teach Casey how to hunt. Uncle John talks about hunting a deer but being distracted by the buck. A therapist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), is watching a news report on the three missing girls and how Claire's father woke up to find the girls and his car gone. Karen then receives an email from someone named Barry, saying they need to speak and it is urgent. Barry is really one of Kevin's multiple personalities. This \"alter\" is a sketch artist with a heavy Boston accent. He meets with Karen regularly in this persona. The girls continue to try to find a way out. They look through a crack in the door and see what appears to be a woman talking to their captor. Claire and Marcia call to the woman for help. She approaches the door, but it is just Kevin wearing a skirt and high heels. This alter is known as Patricia, a polite British woman. Patricia assures the girls that their captor knows why they are there and that he is not allowed to touch them. Karen is in a conference via Skype in which she discusses her patients, most of whom are suffering from DID (dissociative identity disorder), including Kevin. Karen talks about how some identities have capabilities that the other identities may not possess, as well as the way she can sense who has come to \"the light\" (which alter is in control). She adds that people with DID can change their body chemistry with their thoughts. The girls meet another identity, Hedwig, who has the mannerisms of a 9-year-old boy. He claims that Patricia and Dennis (the persona that captured the girls) are mad at him and that he is in trouble. Casey talks to Hedwig in an attempt to get a way out of there by telling him that Patricia and Dennis are still mad at him and that he's in trouble. Hedwig leaves, and the girls start looking for a way out through the walls. Claire finds a hollow spot in the ceiling and starts breaking off the plaster. Hedwig starts to come back, but Casey and Marcia hold the door back as Claire tries climbing out. Kevin reverts to Dennis as Claire starts crawling through the vents. She finds an exit and starts running for help. She hides in a locker but her trembling breath is so loud that Dennis finds her. He orders Claire to take off her shirt because it's dirty. He then locks her in a room by herself. In another session with Karen, Kevin returns as Barry. Karen doesn't believe she is really talking to Barry. She has noticed certain characteristics that Barry is displaying normally seen with other alters like Dennis, such as OCD. Barry insists that he's gotten better. Karen mentions that Kevin has 23 distinct identities. Kevin then becomes Dennis as Karen mentions a 24th identity, \"The Beast\", whom Dennis says is indeed real. Patricia brings Casey and Marcia out for some food. Marcia is forced to remove her skirt and Casey takes off her flannel shirt. Patricia brings the girls into a dining room and starts to make another sandwich. He becomes upset when he accidentally cuts the sandwich crookedly, so he starts making another one. Marcia seizes the opportunity to take a chair and strike Patricia in the back with it. She runs out for help, and Casey tries to run too, but Patricia catches her and orders her to go to her room. Marcia is eventually caught as well and is locked in a room by herself. Karen and her assistant Jai (M. Night Shyamalan) review security footage of outside the building. A trash bin is knocked over with garbage spilled everywhere. One couple walks around it, but Dennis walks right through it, which is something Karen believes is deliberate. Hedwig talks to Casey playfully. He asks to kiss her, and she allows him to, though it is awkward. Hedwig mentions his music collection and how he likes to dance to some Kanye West. Casey asks him to show her his room and his music collection. He takes her there, and she mentions a window that's next to his music. It's just a drawing of a closed window over another drawing of an open window. Hedwig starts to realize that Casey is trying to escape. She becomes frightened and attempts to placate him. He pulls out a walkie-talkie, which Casey uses to start calling for help while fighting off Hedwig. Hedwig subdues Casey and takes the walkie back. We see another flashback with Little Casey on a hunting trip. With her dad not around, Uncle John starts wanting to \"play\". He strips down to his underwear and tells Casey to take off her clothes because \"animals don't wear clothes\". Later, John emerges from behind a rock and sees Casey holding a rifle at him. He manages to take it back from her so that she doesn't pul the trigger. Claire and Marcia attempt to escape using a wire to unlock the door from the outside Marcia's room. They are unsuccessful. Karen goes to Kevin's home and is greeted by Dennis. He invites her inside and they continue to discuss The Beast, as well as \"The Horde\", which is the name given for the major identities that control Kevin (Dennis, Barry, Patricia, and Hedwig). Karen then becomes genuinely terrified. She goes outside and finds Claire trapped in her room, but Dennis pulls Karen away before she can help. Casey finds a laptop with videos on every one of Kevin's identities. She sees one called Orwell, who discusses philosophy, and another named Jade, who is diabetic. Dennis goes to an abandoned train car and starts to transform into The Beast. He is significantly taller and stronger than any other identity. He returns home and finds Karen writing something on a piece of paper. She grabs a small knife as he crawls on the wall and grabs her. Karen starts trying to stab him, but the knife breaks. The Beast then squeezes Karen until her spine snaps and she dies. Casey gets out and tries to find the other girls. She finds Marcia dead with her stomach having been ripped open. Casey then finds Claire alive, but she gets dragged as The Beast starts attacking her. Casey finds the paper that Karen wrote on. It says \"Say his name - Kevin Wendell Crumb\". The Beast finds Casey, but she repeatedly shouts his name, making him revert to normal. We briefly see a flashback of Kevin's mother yelling at him as a child by saying his full name and telling him he's made a mess. Present Day Kevin has no memory of what he's done as Casey tells him he killed Karen, Claire, and Marcia. He tells Casey there's a gun in one of the cabinets, and that she must kill him. The major identities start to take control all at once. Casey runs as The Beast starts to come back. Casey finds some shells and loads them into the gun. The Beast starts crawling up on the ceiling and starts taking out the lights, leaving Casey with no sight to shoot at him. The Beast attacks Casey, ripping her shirt and biting her leg, but she gets away. She closes herself in a cage and loads the gun with more shells. The Beast starts bending the bars to get in, but he then notices multiple scars on Casey's body. Another flashback shows Little Casey after her father's funeral, and John telling her he will be her new guardian. The Beast then proclaims that Casey is pure-hearted, and he leaves her alone. Not long after, a man goes downstairs and finds Casey. He carries her outside to safety. She looks around on the outside and sees many animals in an enclosure. Medics arrive and take Casey in. Kevin is somewhere by himself, with The Horde controlling him completely now. Patricia says that The Beast will protect them now. The last scene is in a diner where people are watching a news report on what Kevin did. The anchorwoman mentions how The Beast identity displays characteristics of the animals in the enclosure where he worked. A patron mentions that the case is similar to a man in a wheelchair from 15 years earlier. When she can't remember his name, someone next to her replies, \"Mr. Glass\". We see that it is David Dunn (Bruce Willis; his character from \"Unbreakable\" in a surprise cameo). Fade out.",

         "I was surprised to see that this movie was released last year (as I'm writing this) and I didn't heard about it, taking in consideration how promising the plot is. Split is about three girls get kidnapped by a man with dissociative identity disorder (DID) that has 23 personalities. I have to say that this movie does not represent what DID really is and how people who struggle with it are, mainly because this movie gets a bit too fantastical sometimes. It doesn't try to be strictly realistic though, so it's an awesome thriller anyway. The movie gives you chills since the very start with an awesome acting by James McAvoy and some seriously good still scenes. The overall scenes make you have a weird feeling, something it succeeds to transfer to the viewer that you probably won't be able to describe. That makes this thriller stand out in a good way. Maybe Split makes a unrealistic representation of dissociative identity disorder, and that can be a big turnoff, but this is a great movie nonetheless.",
         "Shyamalan had his debut with the critically acclaimed 'The Sixth Sense' followed by positively reviewed movies 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs'. After that, he went through a series of duds with 'Lady In The Water' , 'The Village' , 'The Happening' , 'After Earth' and was termed one of the worst directors of all time with 'The Last Airbender'. But, he made a decent comeback with 2015's 'The Visit' which received generally positive reviews and he's back at his game with 'Split'. After a birthday party, three girls, led by Casey, are kidnapped by the troubled Kevin, who has a very rare case of 23 split personalities inside him. What follows is how the three girls try to escape from Kevin who himself is lowly having a mental breakdown. Sorry, I can't tell a lot about this movie as a small factor would spoil it. This movie couldn't have worked without James McAvoy. He has given his best performance in his whole career and stands out as one of the reasons to watch this movie. The cliché points in the movie are watchable just because of his phenomenal performance. His transition from a 'Norman Bates' type woman Patrica to a 9 year old boy Hedwig to other personalities are amazing Last but not the least, is the traditional \"Shyamalan Twist\". Trust me, this time your minds will be blown when you come to the conclusion. This twist doesn't match up to the \"The Sixth Sense\" one but it's a thrilling one. It's not some stupid twist like in \"Signs\". I won't forget that moment when someone behind me shouted out \"WHAAAAT?!\". \"Split\" isn't scary, it's tense. This movie shouldn't have been given a \"horror\" tag. A \"psychological thriller\" sounds better. Nevertheless, this movie is worth a watch. I'm giving a 8/10 with one extra star just for James McAvoy Welcome back, M.Night Shyamalan",
         "This movie will keep you watching waiting for the next character coming out of James McAvoy. He should have won some awards for his performance of a man with many different personalities. James was very convincing in every part he played. The end is great but I don't want to give anything away so I won't comment on that at all. Well written and the actors were perfect. Watch it today, just don't make the mistake of downloading a different movie called Split about bowling. I did that and that is one of the worst movies I ever saw!",
         "firstly, i have to compare this movie to La La Land, because this is what is considered Oscar material and Oscar performances in 2017. If La La Land was an Oscar movie, this is effin' citizen kane. Loved the bruce willis cameo and that there is a cinematic universe somewhere between all those uneven films. This film delivers. It has an amazing performance and realistic characters in a surreal nearly sci-fi but engaging plot. There is no twist end. Not really. There is a bitter end this time. One that stays with you for a while after the movie ends. There is a desperation where there was once a ray of light in the ending. The film is occasionally funny and aware of it and is not easily categorized. It is a subtle commentary on many many things, violence, abuse, human nature, relationships, sexism, modern society, the potential of a human being, racism, the idiocy of the average people, our traumas, madness, the virtue of patience, existential angst etc It is true that it is a horror movie about a sick person, which may not be politically correct but is a very old and common trope in horror flicks. It is also true that this film turns the trope on its back, presenting us a charming psychopath. He does unspeakable things, but he is not evil, he is beyond morality and he has an ambivalent point of view. The movie doesn't take sides. Murder is not a taboo in this narration, it may be an act of God or some creature close to him. The characters that surround the protagonist are also flawed in many ways and not very likable (with a couple of exceptions). There are obvious (and delightful) references to Psycho and the Rocky Horror Picture Show. One thing is certain. This movie is not for people who always had it easy...",
         "Let me start off by saying that I haven't really like Shyamalan's work since \"Unbreakable\", but I have to admit that this movie made me believe in his vision again. I gave him another chance after hearing so many people raving about this movie, and I'm glad I did. This is an excellently acted, directed and thought out movie. It's intense, funny at some parts, and it is incredibly well thought out. Don't listen to haters just because they don't like Shyamalan's movies. Check it out for yourself and make your own decision.",
         "A welcome return to form for the director and James McEvoy gives one of his finest performances. I am not sure how many actors could achieve what he has executed so well here and one wonders if the film could have worked at the highest level without him. In between some of his bigger studio choices he has chosen challenging or interesting roles no matter how the films turn out and his range and talent always keep surprising but he takes it to another level here. I won't reveal too much about the film as others will do that, except to say it was a great film to watch in the theater, full of suspense and in some ways quite touching and meaningful, even if you do or don't like the final twists you'll be drawn in to this story and on the edge of your seat in more of a suspense mode. I wasn't sure if the film would go beyond a typical kidnapping film in the first five minutes but I can assure you its completely different to any expectations you'll have despite the director putting some of his more traditional touches on the film towards the end of it which really work in this case. I've always liked his earlier films as they often look at human conditions or flaws with imagination and some of his films have fallen short but he sounds like he's become more open minded and enjoying his work returning to form so well here and all I can say is well done, he has great attention to detail and gives his all. This is a great film if you want an original suspense/thriller go and see it. I was sorry to see a review that put this film down, those reviews are off the mark this time round in my opinion I hope there is more to come from the M Night daring to be different again, his lower budget work is outstanding and easily brings out his best storytelling. James McEvoy you've smashed it here and given you're all it was worth the risk, keep taking them! Having attended the Q&A he comes across a decent humble man which I would think gives his performances such resonance and skill. Also a great performance from Anya Taylor Joy she's a talent as well. Go see the see the film, especially in the threatre on a big screen it will have you on the edge of your seat.",
         "When this film made it's first debut I was hesitant on seeing it because I thought M. Night Shyamalan had lost his touch a bit but right when I thought everything was over for M. Night being one of my favorite directors/producers I just up and decided to give him one more chance with \"Split\" and I'm so glad I did. This was classic M. Night all the way from the twists and the unpredictable story-line to the scares and the edge of your seat thrills. This is just a great horror/thriller played out as a far fetched psychological thriller. It's well written and the plot is laid out perfectly to the end and If you like older M. Night films you will definitely enjoy this one.",
         "What a terrific comeback for Shyamalan! Many have been vocal that horror writer-director M. Night Shyamalan has been on a downward spiral after having peaked with Unbreakable, his very own superhero origins film. Split sees the continuation of Shyamalan's tryst with the supernatural but also a long awaited rhetoric that this filmmaker was merely waiting for the right moment to resurface. While his last film - The Visit - was predictable but entertaining, Split underscores his storytelling prowess with the high level of creativity that made him a household name in contemporary horror. Yet fans will concur that Split isn't just a comeback either, rather a tactical setup of Shyamalan's very own cinematic universe. Put literally, the film is about a person with multiple personalities where each personality speaks collectively in full awareness of the rest. Although main character Kevin is said to exhibit 23 personalities, we see just a handful during most of the film. There's Barry, a New York fashionista, Hedwig, a goofy 9-year-old, and darker personalities Patricia and Dennis. Calling themselves The Horde, the latter two have influenced the abduction of three high school girls as a ritualistic sacrifice for the 24th personality often referred to as \"The Beast\". The girls have limited time before The Beast is unleashed and although paralysed by fear, their escape depends on protagonist Casey's (Anya Taylor-Joy) proactive deconstruct of the good and evil personalities that reside in Kevin. To her advantage and through revelatory flashbacks, we learn that this wouldn't be the first time Casey would confront a monster. If Edward Norton's dual personalities was chilling in his debut film Primal Fear, wait till you get a load of James McAvoy in what is simply an outstanding performance of versatility (or should I say two dozen performances in one film?). More than just a demanding role to pull off, McAvoy's broad range in this film has also elevated what could have been a familiar antagonist into a nerve wrecking supervillain. Which is why Shyamalan's so called signature twist ending is almost astounding. To be honest there isn't an actual twist in the story, but the ending is an unexpected but seamless integration into a sort of trilogy that will have most viewers gob smacked. It's an inside joke and almost as if Shyamalan is asking if we have you been watching closely, but also an extremely rewarding Easter egg for every true fan of the man. Welcome back Mr. Shyamalan!",
         "Firstly, I loved the concept of this movie and was extremely excited to see it, therefore disappointed was an understatement. However the acting was superb and chilling, so this cannot be faulted. The ending involving the 'Beast\" completely ruined this movie for me as I do not understand how people believe it is acceptable to present individuals with mental disorders as 'monsters' and I regret spending money to support this film. Also, this is not worth watching if you haven't seen the movie 'Unbreakable' as I did not understand any of the references at the end and the ridiculously horrendous plot twist. I initially believed that this film was based around raising awareness of DID (as presented in the trailer), and I loved the idea of viewers gaining an understanding into the true extent of this and potentially developing more of an interest around the subject. But.... this movie did not accurately portray DID correctly and McAvoy's character was not consistent with the criteria meeting the diagnosis of the disorder, due to incorrect facts throughout. So this is not the accurate portrayal I previously anticipated. I found this movie very disrespectful due to the mocking of the disorder and the portrayal of the fact that all people suffering with mental illnesses are dangerous and the belief that people can be purified by suffering. I found this truly upsetting as this can be a very personal and sensitive issue for some viewers. This is likely to lead to stereotypes being formed and people will start to believe these if the wrong message is reinforced enough. I love horror films and mental illness isn't something that should be used to 'scare' people. This is a complete waste of a potentially good story-line and the comic-book incorporation was not advertised at all as if I knew this, I would have no intention to see this movie.",
         "I never have high hopes from M. Night, ever. This is the reason why. Where is the police investigations.. wouldn't one of the personalities turn on the other?? Oh, sure they send e-mails to the doctor..but why not to the local police department ratting one or the other out? I wish I could go negative on the review. Anyone who likes this has taste for complete garbage. Probably enjoyed Windows Me, Vista, 8 and 10 as well. Nice reviews on such utter piles of trash is the reason why we can't get a good movie. They had a birthday party at a mall..where security cameras exist, not only inside the mall but outside as well. Someone 'stalking' another human being would surely turn up on multiple security cameras at some point in time. Oh, right, we aren't suppose to think too much in this. I'm glad I wasn't the one paying for the movie.",
         "me and my partner both went in really looking forward to seeing this film from the trailer, and we both like james mcavoy as an actor, but this was just terrible, i thought the plot got worse and worse and the acting wasn't great either imo, we don't get out much as we have kids but we both regretted going to see this, i pretty much laughed all the way through at how bad it was and throwing the unbreakable reference in the end, couldn't save this from being a bad film, also one of his personalities was a 9 yr old who acted more like a 4 year old, by all means make your own mind up but don't blame me if you read this warning first.",
         "If tour-de-force performances alone made great movies, then \"Sixth Sense\" writer & director M. Night Shyamalan's \"Split\" would be one of the best. Instead, Shyamalan's twelfth movie qualifies as an unintentionally hilarious, multiple identity disorder, abduction chiller about a colorful fruit loop bristling with more identities than you can count on fingers and toes together. As the traumatized casualty of an abusive mom, woebegone protagonist Kevin Wendel Crumb (James McAvoy) has forged a 'Horde' of personalities to serve as a bulwark against grim reality. Predictable, derivative, and ultimately preposterous, \"Split\" contains McAvoy's nuanced performance as well as Shyamalan's usual standard-issue surprises. Indeed, McAvoy has a field day chewing the scenery as a wacko with 23 personalities who is gestating number twenty-four. Basically, this charming but deranged psycho abducts three pretty young things from a Philadelphia shopping mall and confines them for his own culinary delight in an underground facility from which escape is virtually impossible. Compared with other movies about split-personality psychos, \"Split\" does feature a looney tune with a greater number of identities than any other movie. McAvoy's chameleon-like capacity to shift from one identity to another in the flick of an eyelash is as fluid as if he were genuinely conflicted himself. Suffice to say, McAvoy is brilliant, but perhaps not Oscar brilliant. \"Split\" boils down to a clever, self-conscious one-man show despite the quartet of additional characters involved. Unfortunately, we see only eight of the twenty-three weirdos that McAvoy portrays, but none is either demonic or memorable. Meanwhile, two of those four other characters lack sympathy because they brought this tragedy on themselves by ridiculing the psycho. Shyamalan's surprises occur just where you would expect them, and you won't feel the overwhelming urge to shout \"WOW!\" because you are so flabbergasted. Meantime, Shyamalan struggles desperately to spawn suspense, but what he achieves remains at best trifling. Sometimes, this half-baked suspense proves aggravating because you realize how futile it is for these doomed characters. On the other hand, unlike most psychos on killing spree saga, \"Split\" doesn't wallow in gratuitous blood and gore. Casey Cook (Anya Taylor-Joy of \"The Witch\") has been forged in a crucible of child abuse, too. A heart attack killed her father (Sebastian Arcelus of \"Ted 2\") while she was attending elementary school. Sadly, her father's brother, Uncle John (Brad William Henke of \"Fury\"), has assumed the duties as a guardian for Casey. Without divulging too much, Casey and her stepfather have had an adversial relationship. Now, in high school, Casey prefers to keep to herself whenever possible. Two of her snobbish classmates, Claire (Haley Lu Richardson of \"The Edge of Seventeen\") and Claire's African-American friend Marcia (Jessica of \"Honeytrap\"), have invited her to their birthday party more out of mercy rather than friendship. Indeed, they display cynical attitudes about Casey, but they fear the repercussions on social media about what they might have faced had they not invited Casey. When her ride doesn't materialize, Casey agrees to accompany Claire and Marcia and listen to Claire's father (Brian Gildea) who loves to tell terrible jokes. As the saying goes, Hell is a road asphalted with good intentions, and Claire and Marcia have provided the paving that puts Casey in harm's way. Before they can pull out of the parking lot, a stranger, Kevin Wendel Crumb intervenes, dispenses with Claire's dad, and then carjacks them. Slipping on a face mask, he sprays something into their eyes that plunges them into oblivion. Of course, had they not been paralyzed with fear, these girls could have bailed out before Kevin incapacitated them. When they awaken, the girls find themselves locked up in a room with the same tight-lipped stranger staring at them. Eventually, they discover that something is seriously amiss with their captor. Every time Crumb appears, he masquerades as an entirely different fellow, sometimes even as a woman. What the three girls don't know is that Kevin is a patient of a world-renowned psychotherapist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley of \"Frantic\"), who has terribly misjudged the threat that he poses to society. Repeatedly, Kevin tells her about 'the beast' and how this messianic personality will shield all twenty-three personalities from scorn and ridicule. When 'the beast' shows up, \"Split\" turns into a warped Marvel Comics movie because the beast possesses supernatural characteristics. At this point, you want to laugh out loud at this transition from a dreary abduction potboiler to a fantasy epic that happens to be a belated sequel to the Bruce Willis & Samuel L. Jackson thriller \"Unbreakable.\" Nothing in this review has been designed to spoil \"Split\" if you decide to see it. You may walk into this superficial saga with greater awareness than you might have, but far be it for me to sabotage the quirky ending that hinges on purity. Before anybody can complain that I hate all Shyamalan's movies, let me say that I admired \"The Sixth Sense,\" \"Unbreakable,\" \"Signs,\" and \"Lady in the Water,\" but I abhorred \"The Village,\" \"The Visit,\" \"After Earth,\" \"The Last Airbender,\" and \"The Happening.\" \"Split\" belongs to the latter category of travesties. Comparably, as deplorable as it was, \"The Visit\" surpasses \"Split.\" Nothing about \"Split\" is more than timidly suspenseful, and the action degenerates into a series of episodic encounters between McAvoy's various personalities and his victims. Casey is the only other truly interesting character aside from the loquacious Dr. Karen Fletcher. The other two girls might as well have been mannequins. They are essentially expendable, and they behave like whiny victims in a movie where whiny victims must perish. The surprise ending came as neither a relief nor a revelation. More often than not, I felt like Shyamalan cheated with some of the narrative twists that contained neither enough credibility nor sufficient spontaneity. Finally, Shyamalan has exploited Dissociative Identity Disorder as a cheap gimmick to conjure up an uninspired Grimm's style fairy tale that stigmatizes the disorder rather than entertains us as a legitimate horror movie.",
         "Watching this movie is 2 hours of my life I will never get back - A total waste of time and such a disappointment. Mind you this is my review so I'm entitled to comment how I perceived it; and I understand & respect others may see it very differently.... here we go, hopefully in brief. First and foremost I found the continual reference to the child abuse flashbacks irrelevant to the story, unnecessary let alone distasteful. Not to mention the twist from \"normal\" suspense to \"monster incorporated\" suspense toward the end just a tad bit ridiculous. I found the whole movie somewhat drawn out, way beyond achieving the suspense factor which I gather Shyamalan was aiming for, and which I think he failed dismally - it became instead repetitious and boring. The ending I found totally ridiculous - a zoo?? and God forbid it left the viewer with the knowledge there is to be a sequel, which I will be giving a 'big fat miss'.",
         "Shyamalan again disappoints. Idk if I can even say I have spoilers the movie was so boring me and my girlfriend nodded off several times....this guy shouldn't be allowed to make movies anymore. This was like watching golf without the ball ...his therapist ignores signs of of his erratic behavior for nearly 90 percent of the movie ...the lead girl has flash backs of her creepy rapist uncle in a truly unnecessary and lame sub plot. Why not focus on the main plot or making the audience feel the women are in some real danger. It's teased relentlessly that Macao's character is evolving into the beast but when he becomes the beast literally nothing happens..... the plot is trash and I am done paying to see this guy's. Horrible movies ..just like the happening and so many other movies don't waste your money",
         "I didn't think it was all that good, its one of those films that gets over hyped and in the end turns out quite mediocre and boring, yes its funny in parts but you won't be rushing to see it again! Personally, I thought the acting was incredible and I loved the character development. What I didn't like was the portrayal of multiple personality disorder. It went from a very interesting story to a mediocre silly ending where he turns into a monster and starts killing people and starts doing supernatural things. That ruined it for me personally. M Night shyamlans direction was horrible towards the end. So far his best film will only be the sixth sense.",
         "the first 20 minutes was like watching Criminal Minds episode. not it is a bad thing, but if TV series can get you the same excitement, why bother go to cinema ? there is not enough story, not enough mystery, not enough twist, to be told in this movie. if you like to revisit old time feeling when you watched Scream or I Know What You Did Last summer, well, maybe you would enjoy this movie. i definitely don't. if you like split personalities genre, don't get your hope high. Split not even at the same level with Fight Club or even Identity.the things that disturbs me the most is how 'the writer' seems to enjoy half naked teens. one girl needs to take off her shirt, one girl needs to take off her skirt. and you would think they would go a little bit respect with female lead, but nope. save the best for last. she finally took her shirt off so they can save her character (rolling eyes). it is just so stupid and only shows how Hollywood movie and their writers exploit teen sexuality in a very smooth way and nobody seems to realize how sicks these writers are. i mean, it doesn't even contribute to the story line, or any character development (who ? dennis ? what a clever way to explain sexually mental disorder patient, huh). i mean, they could make the girls keep their clothes, and the movie will still be understood like it is. i don't mind with a little bit nudity when it contributes to the story (like in 3096 Days, as disturbing as it is, the girl nudity really give viewers better understanding of the kidnapper and the girl relationship). it's kinda suck for mc avoy, since this must be a very interesting character to be played. and as far as his acting goes, i don't have much complain. but got to be honest, his performance shone away by how bad the story is.",
         "Two smartphone distracted girls and their 'weird' friend are kidnapped by an unknown assailant who carries out the action without any emotion whatsoever. 'Barry' is a model employee. He's been ill, but is better now. Doctor Fletcher (Betty Buckley) says this. We learn of 'Barry's' disorder because Fletcher is trying to widen awareness for his condition. The information about what is known as 'DID' is staggered throughout, at length, and her scenes are interspersed with 'Barry' and his other personalities presenting themselves to his three prisoners. One of these is an upper-class woman called 'Patricia', another is an irritant called 'Hedwig', another is a nuisance called 'Dennis' (who likes to watch girls dance naked). In reality, his name is Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), and he has 23 personalities. Despite claims that, for example, if one personality is a weight-lifter he possesses the strength of a weight-lifter whilst other shared personalities do not, McAvey doesn't have the physical presence to portray anyone that couldn't just be over-powered by the three girls \u2013 or even just one of them (with a more sustained battering than just hitting him once and then turning their back on him, something that happens more than once). Despite the theatrical rolling eyes, the lisp, the change of clothes, he simply isn't frightening. His endless talking about himself makes it clear that his characters are a lot more interesting to him than to the audience \u2013 or at least, this member of it. I can appreciate a committed performance, but sadly he leaves me cold. Perhaps to balance out Kevin's multiple characteristics, the three girls have only one personality between them. Being the allegedly 'weird' one of the trio, it is Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy, who had been so good in 2015's 'The Witch') to whom 'Dennis' is attracted, because of course weirdness is an elite exclusive club that joins every outsider together, provided you're pretty enough ('the broken are the more evolved,' apparently). Luckily for flesh fans, one of Kevin's personalities suffers from OCD, necessitating the young captives to remove much of their 'dirty' clothing. Another box ticked. There have been accusations that 'Split' is offensive to sufferers of mental health disorders. In an age where being offended is a competitive sport, presumably any piece of fiction involving death, for instance, is offensive to anyone who has ever suffered bereavement and therefore 'shouldn't be allowed'. This is a point of view that stifles creativity, fiction, drama and/or many levels of art. That is not the problem with 'Split' in my view. It is an idea that is ripe with potential but simply stretched out very thinly over almost two hours with very little incident. In fact, the kidnapping of three girls is the only incident. Endless scenes of talking about 'Barry's' condition isn't entertaining, frightening or effecting. It very quickly becomes dull and stays that way. Director M. Night Shyamalan had a great success with 'The Sixth Sense' in 1999, especially its twist ending. Subsequently, all his films have ended with a similar surprise, each one less effective than the last. If you make it to the end of this, there is a revelation that (SPOILERS) Kevin's affliction appears to be supernatural. 'The Beast' is physically bulkier than his other personalities, can hop from wall to wall and is impervious to bullets. This ends with a reference to Shyamalan's 'Unbreakable' via a Bruce Willis cameo which pre-supposes you are on familiar terms with that film, which is presumptuous, as this is not billed as a sequel.",
         "Usually horror movies don't get this high rating unless it is really original so I was very skeptical when I saw this movie has 7.5 ..and I was right !!! .... this movie could have ended in 5 minutes. 3 girls facing an average size unarmed guy with mental illness but they decided to do nothing ... not even a punch or a kick but only crying. The room they were locked in had many things which could have been used as a weapon ... i.e the shower curtain rod, the sink, or even their shoes which one of them used to dig a hole in the ceiling, but of course not... also none of them thought of hiding behind the door and attack him from behind when he opens it. Indian movies usually are long and I guess Mr.Shyamalan could not forget his origins, so he tried his best to extend his 5 mins story to almost 2 hours movie. Save your time and money and go stare at an empty wall which will be more exciting than watching this garbage.",
         "Wish they had an option for zero votes, as this movie or film if you'd call it that, doesn't deserve the one vote I gave it. So, this guy M. Knight still puts out crap after all these years. Notice I use 'Knight'as I soon expect the Queen of England to be knighting this fellow with some accolades for his contribution film and motion picture innovation. The opening credits are compelling enough to make one think that there is some hope for film's success; as a lot of work was put into the credits, perhaps more so than the body of the film itself. My hopes were soon dashed after the movie feebly got underway after the bold credit telling us who the director was of this fine piece of nonsense. I found myself (more or less tortured) thinking that the movie should get better and that I for once could write something nice to say about this movie and director. Maybe the guy could learn from his past work and improve with his latest artistic foray. But unfortunately that wasn't the case. As this so called movie has finally taught me never to view another Sham-o-lame movie. Oh we, could all say give the guy a break, he's just trying to be artsy- fartsy what have you. But no, it's not even artsy-fartsy. Poor Mr. McAvoy, his talents seem denigrated after this and it could spell doom and career suicide as well after working with M. knight. I'm surprised that IMDb number is at 7.4 of 10. Wow... Stunning revelation to the capacity of integrity of movie enthusiasts. Yep, they had to bring in Bruce Willis in at the end for some box office draw like some insurance in case the movie severely bombed, which surprisingly it didn't as the box office business indicates $137 million netted from an estimated $9 million production budget. It just means that we'll see some future crap from this guy. I understand that devout fans of M. Knight may be incensed with my comments but after all, opinions are much like orifices, as everyone is born with one or more. Enlighten me if I've missed something as I've gotten nothing from this film except for an 'itch' around the groin. A final word of advice, save your money and more so, your time on this one as you will wish you had after self-debasing yourself with this latest attempt of tom foolery.",
         "I'm going to leave a couple of blank lines just in case you didn't see the SPOILER warning...but apparently it doesn't work. First, I'm going to say I don't particularly like horror movies, so if you're a big horror fan, you MAY love this movie. I hate any movie where women act stupid, helpless, slow...you get the idea. Poverty makes a woman intolerant and if you are a strong woman, this movie is going to seem like someone is slowly scratching their nails across a chalkboard. By the end of the movie I was hoping the beast would kill the victim! The story line is simple. Stupid girl doesn't pay any attention to her surroundings, stupid girl let's guy drug her and her two friends with aerosol, guy shoves 3 stupid girls in a locked room and keeps them there while he goes through his alternate personalities. There are plenty of chances for girls to escape, run away, but then they get all \"oooo, I'm a girl, I can't use my brain, I have to be helpless\" and they get locked in different rooms. In the end, multi-personality guy changes into a mutant and kills his shrink and two of the girls. When he gets to the last girl we painfully watch as she just acts idiotic, drops shotgun shells all over, has a chance to kill the beast by shooting him multiple times at his C1 vertebrae, but does she do it? NOOOOO, she just lets him get away. Now there's a mutant killer running around free. At that point I was hoping a large piece of the ceiling would kill her and put US out of our misery. Instead she continues to act stupid, mousy, like she owes the guy because he didn't kill her. In the end, there's a special cameo that tie's into another M. Night Shyamalan movie. I will never go to another horror movie again. I know people will say, but it was all about a mental health issue and it was supposed to be complex, etc. My friend wanted to share the joy of the X-Men movies with me as I'd never seen them, so I'd watched all of them in chronological order (including Logan). I also watch Legion on TV, so I'm over the whole multi-personality thing. Again, if you like horror, maybe you'll like this. If you HATE watching women acting stupid and helpless, stay away from this film. You'll be doing yourself a favor. Buyer beware!",
         "The trailer made this film look quite interesting. However, from the very start, it was hardly captivating at all. The \"acting\" of the young actresses was atrocious! The girls not fighting back (even when Kevin's personality was a child!) was plain stupid. The flashbacks were forced, oh, and the ending... Why, just why??? The supernatural twist with a bunch of so-called philosophical citations?! Bad, bad, bad, so bad, really, really bad!",
         "Not too sure why this title was so highly rated. The synopsis really captivated me and I believe the potential of the movie was vast however, Split did not perform up to my expectations. The movie lacks substance and builds towards a supernatural ending of gore and violence. I like how the theme of abused is being highlighted, yet the movie does very little to build upon it. The possibility of humans having multiple personalities to enhance themselves is a fascinating topic but yet again, the movie did not portray it in a good light.",
         "With time being our most precious commodity, I try to carefully select the movies I do watch, as I don't have a ton of time to watch them. But the hype around this movie, and of course the (mind boggling) 7.4 IMDb rating tempted me enough to give it a chance. I sat down excited with my favorite snacks - hoping to be in for what some called 'one of the best horror movies this year so far'. Wow.... really? Horror? This is NOT horror. It's a suspense thriller / drama at best. This movie couldn't even scare a 12 year old. And THIS is supposed to be the \"return of M Night Shyamalan\"? What? I absolutely loved Signs, and The Sixth Sense is amazing too. But his movies since have gone down hill. The Visit was very lackluster and pretty disappointing too. But not as disappointing as this stinker. At least with The Visit - there was no claims or hype saying this was his 'return to form' so I didn't expect a lot. But Split? This is more like a terribly executed amateur film students idea of a \"thriller\". The first 20-30 minutes, the movie has your interest a little bit as you wonder about the kinds of twists and surprises you are about to treated to. Maybe the guy is a ghost? Maybe there are actually more than one main protagonist? Maybe the girls are in an alternate reality? Maybe there is an actual, physical, hairy (as they describe him) monster that we will soon get to see? Oh man...that would be cool.. These are things I was eagerly thinking as I was watching, hoping I would be right, and that if so - these plot twists could turn this how I would have written if it I was behind it. But nope. As time goes on, you realize, there is NOTHING exciting happening. Just some incredibly boring dialogues, a character study of multiple personality disorder, some dumb girls trying to escape, and several conversations between a shrink and her patient. *Yawn* The ending? I was half asleep at that point but it was extremely underwhelming and disappointing. So the 'beast' just looks like the dude, just with some veins popping out, and he can climb walls? Wow, amazing. Not. Save your time and do not listen to the positive reviewers. I think they were paid by Universal Studios to bring up the overall score here.",
         "The movie isn't bad, it's horrible! I've watched with high expectations, I was expecting a good thriller, full of twists and thrilling scenes like Don't Breathe (2016), but Split revealed to be the biggest disappointment of this year. The script is weak and full of holes, for example: the psychologist could have survived if she screamed the name that she wrote on the paper, the 3 kidnapped girls could attack the raptor and escape. In my opinion, it's not even a clever film, it turns out to be a fantasy/supernatural movie, the characters are uninteresting and don't create a connection with the viewer. The abducted girls are in better conditions than the viewers of this film, fortunately they didn't paid to see this crap. Rate: 1.5/10",
         "So M Night is back. The man who has been on a downwards spiral, well, since his first film. The 6th Sense, was excellent, in my opinion. I liked Unbreakable, but Signs was garbage and nearly everything else he has done has been rubbish (the Village has some merit). Now this was interesting, no question. James M was stunning in his performance (similar to Filth, a brilliant film). However, I was waiting for the pay off at the end of the movie. I assumed that the girl was either all 3 girls or the girl was just one of the personalities, that might have been a clever ending, but in the end, nothing; it just ended. Huh? What was the point of the uncle story? It added nothing. I thought it actually might have something to do with the whole story, but no, totally meaningless. I gave it a 1, as it lead nowhere and was a waste of time. The acting of the 2 main characters was brilliant, IMO, so deserved a higher score, but the writer and director deserves a minus 10, which balances it out. Complete crap!"
