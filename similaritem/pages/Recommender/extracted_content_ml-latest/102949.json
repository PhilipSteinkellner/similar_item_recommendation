            "content": "Operation Grendel\r\n\r\nAge of Heroes is directed by Adrian Vitoria and Vitoria also co- writes the screenplay with Ed Scates. It stars Sean Bean, Danny Dyer, Aksel Hennie, Izabella Miko, James D'Arcy, William Houston, John Dagleish and Stephen Walters. Music is by Michael Richard Plowman and cinematography by Mark Hamilton.\r\n\r\nPic is based on the real life exploits of James Bond creator Ian Fleming. This telling sees a unit of Commandos sent on a mission to the mountains of Norway to knock out an important German communication tower whilst purloining information to aid the war effort. \r\n\r\nIn truth it doesn't add a great deal to an already over stocked \"men on a mission\" sub-genre of war films, but there's enough excitement, explosions, potent character dynamics and military shenanigans, to keep things at the better end of a viewing experience. Cast are fine, all portraying familiar types seen in countless films of this ilk, the snowy Norwegian locations are a sight for sore eyes, and Vitoria does a nice job of giving his film an old fashioned feel - complete with the obligatory Nazi atrocity to add some venomous oomph to the plotting.\r\n\r\nThe inclusion of Izabella Miko on the mission sadly comes off as a token female shoehorn job, and I agree with what other reviewers have said as regards the finale, it does feel a bit rushed as this pic definitely could have done with another 15 minutes or so. Yet being an old fashioned guy myself, I liked it well enough and was glad to have viewed it. 7/10",

            "content": "A simple but fairly okay World War 2 movie. The blurb about the film talks about \u201ctrue story\u201d but as usual it is more \u201cbased on\u201d stuff. \r\n\r\nThey apparently did not have much of a budget when doing this movie and I am fairly surprised that Sean Bean is in it. It is a quite simple and straightforward movie and could easily have been a TV-movie rather than a theatre feature. I probably would have been more harsh in my review if I would have made the effort to go to a theatre to watch it.\r\n\r\nIt is however, a fairly okay movie. It wont win any prizes for special effects but it has decent acting and a story that is not too bad. Sean Bean is good as usual but I do not think he gets the chance to shine like he does in some movies.\r\n\r\nThe ending feels a bit rushed though. Like we-ran-out-of-money-lets-wrap-it-up. It still made for a okay movie watching evening though.",

         "It's a solid action flick for sure - nothing terribly new, but it does good work with the WW2 formula that other war flicks have used before. There is no one flaw I can point to in this film as my reason for giving it a 7, but quite honestly, the thought that stayed in my mind as I watched it was that this film while good, had the potential to be great. It falls short. The acting and character development is intriguing, but lacks the depth of characters in films like Inglorious Basterds. It has a fun story, but a little more detail could have may the commando training subplot as well as the rest of the movie so much more. The beginning is great, but leaves many scenes to the imagination of the viewer. You almost have to wonder if the film was gutted in order to shorten the running time to its fairly short hour and a half. Like I said, it's good - but it could have been great.",
         "I set out watching this movie with minimal expectations given that many war stories typically revolve similar themes. The beginning of the movie all the way through to the mid sections surprised me with strong character plays and development from Sean Bean and the revolving cast. The story line while not new, managed to capture my attention with good acting and keeping the story on the go. Unfortunately as it nears towards the end, the story seems to have been \"chopped off\" with a somewhat quick ending to a nicely built up story. I believe this could have been better done with a proper ending to the story. Good acting though.",
         "I'm not understanding all the negativity in the user reviews about this film. Sure, Sean Bean is not the world's greatest actor, but he did a fine job in this role. True, the movie shared some themes found in other WWII movies, but how can that possibly be avoided in this day and age? The movie does lack moments of depth--for example the training camp in Scotland shows lots of yelling and little else. However, contrary to previous opinions, the mission is quite clearly explained prior to the team undertaking it--hence the need for the non-commando \"specialist\" who is brought along to ensure success. This movie was entertaining, moves at a brisk pace (although too brisk in some places), and has fun moments combined with tragic and sad. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I found it enjoyable, and while not Academy Award material, I would recommend that anyone who likes Action/War movies takes a look.",
         "It definitely seems that this movie was butchered to bring it down to a shorter length action flick and take it out of the realms of a wartime espionage type thriller. The plot is loosely based upon the experiences of Ian Fleming (ala. James Bond author) during his time in the commandos during WWII and really should have been much more of an espionage movie and less of a 'let's all do or die'. The story also really fails to even manage that also as the resultant feeling of the movie when all is said and done is kind of a 'let's barely manage to do and also pretty much all die' story instead. Sure, realism is an important point in a war film as those that sugar-coat it too much or simply turn into weird fantasy come of feeling really false (think of the apparently drug-induced nonsense of Kelly's Heroes) but that doesn't mean to say it has to make you feel utterly miserable as many parts of this movie do. With the inclusion of the Danny Dyer character from the stockade and pending court-martial, the training sequence in a bare landscape somewhere in England, the parachute drop into enemy territory, the maniacal SS squad hunting down the heroes through to the main mission and final escape to freedom, there seems to be too much borrowed from many other films (The Dirty Dozen, Where Eagles Dare etc.). There are whole sections of this film that seem to be missing in the final cut which make things a little rushed and not to mention confusing. During the training sequence of the film Dyer's character is punished for being a good marksmen and subsequently told that if he had failed in his training and was being sent back to the stockade. 'Why?' you are left asking as there has seemingly been no cause for to be necessary as we haven't seen Dyer misbehave, be rude to anyone or fail any training task he has been given. We also assume that Bean' and the Sgt characters are killed or captured during the final stages of the movie but we just don't know as it isn't part of the film nor is the air-drop into Norway where we lose a character due to a broken neck (presumably on landing). My strongest dislike in the movie was the over-use of the 'F' word by pretty much all the squaddies, NCOs and officers as it just isn't necessary. One sentence from the Sgt's mouth was around twenty words long and over half of them where the 'F' word and I know from stories told to me by my late Grandfather, who was a WWII serving Drill\\PT instructor in the British Army, that bad language was not permitted and quite often meant disciplinary action with the strongest language being permitted being around the 'bloody-hell' mark. Besides all that the movie had the potential to be so much better and fails to deliver on so many levels that I would suggest people avoid it at all costs (something I very rarely say about a movie). I give the movie a 2-star review as I personally reserve a 1-star for the truly awful but also feel obliged to add that if this film's plot, cast and editing where a whole 100% better than in the final release I would still not consider giving it more than a 4-star vote. Final Words: do yourself a favour and watch the classic Where Eagles Dare instead of this movie as it is a truly awesome movie with everything that Age Of Heroes should and could have been and a whole lot more!",
         "I don't understand all those negative comments. It's a simple ww2 movie about a commando team in the making. The actors are acting good, but it never intended to be a deep Shakespeare like prizewinning movie. As war movies go, it's quite entertaining. I wasn't bored. It isn't the best movie i've seen, but it's really worthwhile. It immediately made me think about all the dirty dozen movies, but those are more \"the A-team like\", this movie is more serious. I've seen almost all ww2 movies (i collect them) and this isn't one to miss. Do not take this it to seriously, and you'll love it, if you do, you might get bored, it isn't a typical Hollywood blockbuster....",
         "The most credible detail with this story is the Norwegian actor Aksel Hennie, who had the lead in the excellent WW2 film 'Max Manus � Man of war'. That film is realistic. In real life, operations against occupied Norway were well organized from Scotland, where soldiers could be trained under winter conditions with native Norwegians as consultants and participants. Best known is Kompani Linge (Linge's Company). To drop soldiers over Norwegian mountains in winter without proper equipment would be suicide. Several people have reacted to the lack of camouflage clothes, but even worse is the lack of skis. At the end of the film, the survivors are ordered to \"walk to Sweden\" from an area in the mountains \"north of Bergen\" � a distance of 400 miles (650 km) through the most hostile environment in northern Europe. Without skis and food. And probably without long underwear. The most realistic film about British raids into Norway was the old 'Kampen om tungtvannet' (The Battle for the heavy water, 1948), later corrupted by Hollywood in the Kirk Douglas film 'The Heroes of Telemark' (1965). In 2005, BBC made a 3-part documentary called \"The real heroes of Telemark\" where modern top-trained and top- equipped soldiers almost failed when trying to repeat the achievement of surviving a whole winter in the Norwegian mountains. This documentary is still available on YouTube.",
         "Just seen this movie little bit disappointed how British commandos can be easily captured and in quantity even the torture scene with the captured SAS soldier was just awestuck took sean bean long enough to keep him quiet. They don't even wear winter smocks for camouflage and there standing out in the open with 'just shoot me' all written all over them. They don't even hide the dead German bodies or their parachutes or at least try to sniper the SS officer. I can only say that when it gets to the end you become disappointed. You don't know what happens to sean bean's character and his companions, did they ever evacuate and what about the secret information they stole is unknown. There is not even a quote or written details in the end to say what happened or if there is going to be a sequel, it was as if it was cut short. The actual true story is set in France not Norway and it was named Operation Biting not Operation Grendel not that I know of. Don't expect it to be clint eastwood style like that movie 'Where Eagles Dare' they probably didn't had enough money to make a movie similar to that.",
         "Sean Bean as good in this film as he usually is, and Danny Dyer(Rains) surprisingly convincing as the cheeky,rebellious British soldier. Good early scenes up in Scotland,& a good opening scene with Danny & his platoon in northern France heading for Dunkerque and later memories, once the film is set in Norway in winter, of \"Heroes of Telemark\". There was one quite harrowing scene where the local villagers were shot by the Nazi Occupying Forces, but the ending fell flat. Nonetheless, will seek out the sequel in 2012. Recognised a young Guy Burnet (as Riley)but he was unable to add little to this movie as far as the script allowed the guy; he gifted an OK performance however, as a\"tommy\"fighting for King&Country. This was a standard WWII movie with good stunts and action scenes,and I spent an enjoyable Sunday afternoon viewing it - far from time wasted.",
         "Well I love Sean Bean and follow him since Stormy Monday through Sharpes epic. I am also happy to see Miko (she's not much appreciated where I live. But regardless of those two this movie is so mediocre. Acting is OK - if you won't laugh seeing Sean is waving dagger instead of sword. Shots are alright but don't expect to see 40s London or anything (low budget). Effects are... Yes there are some effects in this movie, not too many though, and mostly 2d. What is totally awkward is the plot. Some strange training and preparations. Then endless shooting, evil Nazis doing snuff movies, shooting, explosions, more shooting, exploding Nazis. And then finale: quick as if they run out of tape (long walk to Sweden takes 5 secs). Some characters die obviously but we don't really know or see how. To sum up: don't expect great entertainment. This movie is low budget or some kind of financial con. If you like shooting and explosions (or exploding Nazis) then rent it.",
         "I had decent hopes for this flick going into it as I am a fan of movies like 'Where Eagles Dare' and 'The Dirty Dozen', and the first half hour or so of this movie gave me hope of a similar ride. However, ten minutes or so after the bullets start flying this movie goes into the toilet. The ending was one of those 'well, we've run out of money, let's just rap this story up' scenarios. Multiple plot lines were never resolved and this movie just left me wanting to know why I had just wasted my time watching such a crappy movie. I am only thankful that I didn't try and convince my wife to watch this movie as that would have been an epic that I would have never lived down."

         "Based on the real-life events of Ian Fleming's 30 Commando during World War II this is a story which takes our heroes from the edge of defeat on the beaches of Dunkirk to the mountains of Norway on a dangerous mission behind enemy lines that, if successful, could change the course of the war.",
         "In 1940, Major Jones is assigned to assemble an 8-men commando team to travel to Norway with specialist Roger Rollright to meet the agent Beowulf and destroy the German Freyo Station and steal German state-of-the-art technology of Radio Direction Finding (RDF) in Operation Grendel. Jones travels to the Dashwood Military Prison to bring the soldier Brightling and he brings also the insubordinate Corporal Bob Rains; then the commando team heads to Scotland to be trained. When they fly to Norway, they are discovered and the plane crashes. Six members of the military unit and the specialist survive to the attack. After the assignment, the naval pickup is not possible and the survivors without supply and little ammunition need to walk to Sweden in a dangerous journey through a land occupied by German forces.",
