         "content": "> The woman who knew every inch of the middle-east!\r\n\r\nIt is a kind of female version of 'Lawrence of Arabia', the lead actress herself told that. A biographical drama of a British woman who had played an important role in many middle-eastern affairs during the early 1900s. After the tragic death of the man she was madly in love, the young Gertrude Bell decides to travel across the middle-east to write about it and to do some archaeological research and other stuffs. After the decades of travel on all the corners of the region, what she achieved was the film disclosed in an inspiring way.\r\n\r\nI love this director's films and filmmaking style. It is his first time since last 6 years, but not good as I expected. It is a bit of both, documentary and feature film. Awesomely shot, I loved the camera work and actors too did so well. Nicole Kidman was brilliant, might be her best for portraying in a real life character. Yet something was missing from the film. Maybe the film came at the wrong time, should have been made at least 15 years ago. Otherwise, it is an Oscar worthy product.\r\n\r\nThis film is worth watching for the beautiful desert landscapes and obviously for Kidman. The issue with the story is the focus which completely relied on Kidman's role. She was everywhere and leaving blank on the other end. Something like showing what she accomplished was the notion, so in perspective, it could have made a better documentary film. Some people might like it, especially if you're from the middle-east. But don't expect I would recommend it, because I won't. Whatever I said the film was not bad, just a 50-50 kind.\r\n\r\n5/10",

         "Queen of the Desert breaks form with several other Herzog movies: A female lead character, a grand Hollywood-like production and most interesting: a different perspective on the culture-nature dichotomy and the effects of cultural distance that almost forms the core of Herzog's work. It tells the story of Gertrude Bell (Kidman), an English writer and traveler who became more and more influential in the Middle East region through her unprecedented travels where she formed bonds with several future postcolonial leaders. Later in life she became involved in politics and helped to found several nation states (and determine its borders), along which Jordan and Iraq through the Hashemite dynasties. She worked in close cooperation with T.E. Lawrence (Pattison). It is always interesting to see what's left out of the story: her efforts to establish the new countries were far more extreme and tiresome (plus the real reason Iraq was founded: cost-cutting by the British Empire), her witnessing of the Armenian genocide and slave trade, her actual spying role, her relative poverty, illness and depression later in life. What is paid attention to elaborately are her love interests (well played by Franco and Lewis), both ending in tragedy. But too much are we watching a watered-down, Hollywood interpretation of Bell by Kidman and not the real strong and intelligent woman she obviously had to be handling the complexities of deal making in the region. Yet some typical trademarks of Herzog still shine through: travel to unknown, unmapped places where people find their cultural beliefs and visions on reality tested. In Herzog's world, venturing into nature from the cultural boundaries of existence always leads to suffering and destruction, mankind being unable to conquer the forces of nature. What makes this movie then atypical in the work of Herzog is that Bell finds solace and fulfillment through that process. Also atypical is the time we spent inside: these scenes inside the bastions of power are unfortunately not the best in the movie, and in the landscape scenes, Herzog seems much more on his turf. Herzog always saw himself as resisting the banality of the images film is projecting, but here he somewhat contributes to that process. Despite that Queen of the Desert is still very watchable, informative and yes, even entertaining.",
         "What a massive disappointment from Herzog. Before this I was a huge Herzog fan, which is why this film is such a bizarre shock. It was as though Werner Herzog had suddenly become a pupil of Josh Boone, which is like Mozart taking lessons from Justin Bieber. Is this some kind of joke? Sadly not. This is an over long, melodramatic, corny idealisation of an aristocratic woman who, having no real responsibilities in life, decides to use her vast wealth to embark on a life long holiday across the desert, because really what else is she do with her time? Throughout the film the main character is idealised, swooned over, worshipped and deferred to. Why? Not because she belongs to the most privileged and powerful class of women on the planet, but because she has a courageous heart and a deep, enigmatic understanding of Arabs. At the end we have some childish moralising about the injustice of the British empire, aptly spoken from one aristocrat to another (without a lick of irony) and then the 'Queen' of the upper classes rides off into the desert to be immortalised as a female idol for generations to come. Not that she actually did anything to help anyone whatsoever. Poorly acted, poorly written, poorly conceptualised and thoroughly boring.",
         "Gertrude Bell is one of the most remarkable people (of either sex) to have ever lived...but you wouldn't know it from this film. Archaeologist, mountain climber, poet, translator, linguist, explorer, diplomat, spy, (to name just a handful of her many accomplishments) and all in a time in which women were virtually prohibited from doing any of those things, for the most part, and in territories that even men of the time feared to tread. In addition to being the world's expert on both Sunni and Shiite relations before, during and after WWII, she was charged with drawing up the boundaries for modern day Iraq. She was respected, admired and desired. But, since she was female, it took nearly a decade to green light a movie on her life and then some man decides to make her life story an epic \"romance\" and, of course, make the MEN in her life central to her story. How heartbreaking that her story was so terribly contrived to conform to Hollywood's stereotypes about women and women's lives. And how more tragic that this film could not even find a U.S. distributer as of this writing. This is why we live in a world that thinks women make little to no contributions to history. We rarely tell their stories and when we do, we stuff the round peg of a remarkable life into the square hole of Hollywood sexist tropes, believing no one wants to see a film with a female protagonist unless she's spending at least half the movie pining over some man in order to feel whole. While the movie does cover many of her remarkable accomplishments, my beef with the film is the need to weigh her story down with overly melodramatic, poorly written scenes of tragic love instead of celebrating a superlative life of unique and notable triumphs. I wanted to see more on her travels, her discoveries, her diplomacy, her efforts during the war. Just gender flip this film (although it would be hard to find a man of history as accomplished in multiple fields as she was) and you'll see how ridiculous is the script's focus on what was only one facet of the brilliant gem that was Gertrude Bell. I urge anyone interested in history to read about this woman's life. Desert Queen: The Extraordinary Life of Gertrude Bell, by Janet Wallach is a great biography. Hollywood has perfected the fine art of trivializing and \"romanticizing\" women's history...yet again.",
         "I believe that Queen of The Desert is greater than the sum of its parts, and that its parts are inspired to begin with. So many things about this film are beyond beautiful, they are sublime. I watched it twice. I don't know if Werner Herzog wanted to make a Hollywood-style period romance, and it doesn't matter to me whether anyone else thinks he achieved creating one or not. The film isn't about a romance, it's about romance, period. Specifically, the romance that can find itself at the center of someone's life. Herzog told a story in which Bell had multiple romantic relationships that weren't just with people. In this way he gave her character a deep spiritual life. She had a fling with poetry and writing, an affair with the desert, passion for traveling, true love with multiple men, and loving friendships. In addition, every main character is shown to be loving in some way. I like TE Lawrence's character (played delightfully by Robert Pattinson) because he tries like mad to avoid romance, but also seems to be feigning his aversion. In QOTD, many characters risk their lives for love, and some do give their lives. It isn't just one or two main characters, and it isn't just for the love of another person. Near the end of QOTD, a bedouin leader asks Bell why she loves them (Arabs) so much. By her answer, which is a tribute to her trusted guide Fattuh, we understand what she's all about, and what this film is all about. It's beautifully written dialogue by Herzog. One of my very favourite things about this film was the number of times Kidman was shown laughing. There is hardly a character in the film with whom she isn't seen sharing a good laugh. The film isn't funny, and Bell wasn't meant to be comedic. And yet there is this frequent laughter. That's joy. There's joy in this film. This is what has made Queen of The Desert one of my favourite movies of all time. I enjoyed the \"dreaminess\" of the film. In no way was it psychedelic or self-referential (done for effect). It was written into Gertrude Bell's character. This was a wonderful artistic choice. Random things I loved: The references to poetry and literature. The loud camels nearly ruining the grand orchestral score. The steampunk-ish pistols in the case. James Franco flirting like only James Franco can. The snow in the desert! No subtitles. And most of all, the use of a good number of truly great actors from around the world who are of Arab descent. Some favourite moments: the close-up on Bell when she and Cadogan hold hands for the first time. When Doughty-Wylie kisses her for the first time and her reaction is shown at length (such complex acting from Kidman and Lewis here, especially Kidman). The hand-held camera at the desert camp. The pain of the young Arab messenger as he confesses to Bell, \"I would give anything for a woman like you,\" knowing he would never see her again but for that moment. The Shiek of the Druze talking Virgil. Anytime a filmmaker is both writer and director, like Herzog is here, there will be a divergence from the tropes of the genre in which his film may be expected to fit. Hopefully the audience will buy in to his vision. I did wholeheartedly.",
         "Obviously the director of this movie does not understand the context of the middle east and he is taking this part of the world as a bulk and treating it as a whole. When in Tehran they speak Arabic, Tehran is in Iran they speak Farisi not Arabic, when in the market one guy is obviously Moroccan while the movie is narrating a middle eastern story (Amman Jordan) different dialect, and the Beddouin music always starting with Allah W Akbar which is a religious chant not necessarily specific to the middle east where you can find Christians, Kurds and a lot more ethnicity. To make long story short the director reflected his understanding of the ME based on orientalist concepts and not real facts.",
         "A film worth seeing, explains the birth of present middle east. A visionary feast and both Nicole Kidman and James Franco's acting is superb.Most critics didn't give it a thumbs up but for me it was a beautiful film, maybe because the lead was a woman who changed the course of history! For anyone who doesn't know anything about the middle east should see it just for history and Gertrude Bells significance in history.... The photography is exhilarating and get to see the desert and the oasis in their beauty. The movie might lack historical details but it focuses on Gertrude Bells life, so that is understandable. But at least for people who never knew what or how the middles east came about and what she did it is an eye opener. A must see file for me!",
         "QUEEN Of THE DESERT, In Competition at Berlin 2015, A chronicle of Gertrude Bell's life, a traveler, writer, archaeologist, explorer, cartographer, and political attaché for the British Empire at the dawn of the twentieth century. You've heard heard of \"Sheena, Queen of the Jungle\": Now meet \"Gertie, Queen of the Desert\" as portrayed by an ever lovely and delicate Nicole Kidman in Werner Herzog's epic sandy biopic of English aristocrat Gertrude Bell, who became a sort of female Lawrence of Arabia when she was enthralled by the purity of the way of life of the Bedouin nomads of the middle eastern deserts and ventured on her own into the interior to study their cultures first hand and hob- nob with the sheiks despite strong objections by the British governors in Cairo and Baghdad. Along the way you'll also run into a gritty dropout Lawrence of Arabia who comes on like a skateboarder in drag and a bungling caricature of Winston Churchill falling all over himself as he attempts to mount a camel worried mainly about his lit cigar that got dumped in the process. See Fantastic sandune-scapes and the prettiest camels ever screened to fill out this vast portrait of the Middle East in World War I when the lines in the sand were drawn which stake out today's Arab Spring Nightmare. Topical background in view of today's headlines -- ISIS beheadings and incineration of hostages and all that, most lushly filmed in Morocco and Jordan with an extensive cast you will need a scorecard to keep track of and so long it feels like GWTW, but worth the patience it takes to sit through especially if you are a Werner Herzog unconditional and, like myself, a lover of camels. Quite beautiful to watch but it does take patience and should be provided with an intermission to break up the interminability. In the packed house press screening I attended on the first full day of the festival there was a steady trickle of walkouts after the halfway mark and sparse polite applause at the end. Might win something, however, because this is Herzog Lifework homage year in Berlin but is really overblown with many hoaky impersonations of Arab Shieks and Kidman -- though more radiant than ever -- is far too delicate a flower to portray the hardy desert survivor the real Gertrude Bell of the title (1868 - 1926) must have been -- and at forty a bit old to play a teenager and a young women in her twenties. INDIE-WIRE comment: The legendary filmmaker's first movie in competition at the Berlin International Film Festival in decades is a catastrophe. What gives? -- Well, sometimes something's gotta give ....",
         "Queen of the Desert might be Herzog's most brilliant film to date. But it is not a work of genius--not because it isn't great but because Herzog failed to dumb it down for average movie-going audiences. Hence for many it will come across as a stock, even boring, romantic adventure drama. If you see it that way, well, I can't help you. It is timely, beautiful, and relevant. Most reviewers missed the mark on this one, although in a commercial sense it probably won't be successful because it will fly over the heads of typical audiences, especially in the U.S. Warning for the masses: no spaceships or aliens, and precious few gunbattles. (Btw, I'm in Wisconsin, and I hate history lessons.)",
         "Having worked in Saudi Arabia, I was really looking forward to this film. But it fell short in just about every way. Historically it was dreadful (starting in 1914 and then \"going back\" 12 years - by my simply maths this is 1902 - to have a toast to Queen Victoria by an embassy official is nonsense since she had died in 1901!) The acting was hackneyed and Nicole Kidman, though trying very hard, was totally unconvincing. Numerous people have pointed out the howlers such as the wrong language being spoken, reading from left to right, and handling food with the left hand; and how on earth did she keep her skin lily-white while riding through the desert. At the very least she could have expected a somewhat red nose and face! But the main criticism must be the script which was so predictable and puerile and laughable and lacked depth in any way whatsoever. A great shame as much of the location and images were lovely - and I could even believe some of the scenes shot in Morocco and Jordan were actually shot in Saudi. If you like desert scenery you may well enjoy this film, just so long as you don't think for one moment this biopic reflects reality.",
         "For quite a while I kept wondering if Herzog is able to make at least one good movie without Klaus Kinski. Kinski loathed Herzog. In one of his books, he described him as completely clueless, arrogant and as a ruthless, dumb and incompetent creep. Herzog, on the other hand, called Kinski a mad egomaniac. Well, both were right, but while the madness made Kinski a genius actor, the cluelessness made Herzog an insufferably bad director. This movie proves it. There is no storytelling whatsoever, just abysmally bad, cheesy dialogue (book: Werner Herzog) and nothing even remotely interesting. The photography is average at best. The story is about non-existing. On top of it all you have Nicole Kidman who moves like she got something up her spine and who apparently has disimproved her formerly nice features with botox. To summarize: wooden acting, poor dialogues, no story, no storytelling and average photography. It looks and feels like the work of an incompetent director and writer. Avoid at all costs.",
         "The life of the adventuress and explorer Gertrude Bell might just seem like the kind of subject that the director Werner Herzog might embrace but this stately, grandiose epic is more like something James Ivory or even David Lean might have tossed off and which, for over two hours, moves at a snail's pace. Nicole Kidman does what she can with the part of Bell but is defeated by Herzog's own ponderous script and she is surrounded by some very dull men, (Damian Lewis, James Franco and Robert Pattinson as a slightly camp Lawrence of Arabia), and despite the locations it's not even a particularly attractive looking film. If you must spend time with a queen of the desert stick with Priscilla whose adventures were a lot more fun than Gertrude's.",
         "This is again a cheap movie they serve us. Where did they get it? Desert Queen ?! This lady is simply a daughter of some rich parents, and after they had suffered heavy blows in love, she began an adventure in the Arabian desert! The acting was also very substandard! And then there was some fragments in which Col. T. E Lawrence of Arabia came out! Very poorly acted by Robert Pattinson! And then he insulted the Arabs in one way or another! False, and based on falsehood! The only thing that was good about this film is the decor and the Arabian desert. And of course the Arab actors who came in! Especially the ladies! Poor movie! But maybe recommended for women who are romantically. And don't care about the authenticity nor the performance of the actors!",
         "Important to acknowledge at the outset that Herzog is not a young man. He's the same age as Scorsese and note how long it's been since Scorsese settled on being an illustrator, a lifetime. Herzog as recently as a few years ago was still venturing out in search. Having said that, it's hard to fathom this was made by the same man who gave us Stroszek and Fitzcarraldo. In those, the place was real. The protagonists were actual lost souls, not actors feigning. The journey was about actually going where we did to tug for transcendence. He has a female lead this time, the very first time if I'm not mistaken. He has been hobnobbing with Hollywood people for a decade, perhaps the question was put to him, perhaps he thought he had been remiss himself all this time. No matter, like so many of his characters, he gives us someone who yearns to venture outside maps, explore hazardous edges of the world. But he has everything else be conventional and streamlined this go round. Actors stay actors whether they're playing Turkish gendarmes or Druze rebels. Oriental music swells over sand dunes like you would expect from any other film. He filmed in Morocco sets standing in for the Middle East. So yes, atypical for Herzog, a letdown, not one of his high marks. Others fret in comments about Herzog not getting the trivia right, right to left writing and such. What's really the trouble for me is that it dulls the edge of dangerous discovery that set him apart. We're in the Lawrence of Arabia timeline anyway and the film is cut from that Hollywood cloth. We're always more or less safely ensconced. The film has been so gracelessly attacked in reviews however it makes me want to take a step back. All or some of this would have been obvious to him while preparing anyway, so the question is, what got him out of bed and across the ocean to make this? No answer is going to be particularly lucid I feel or avoid sounding like excuse. Maybe he couldn't resist the opportunity of going on cinematic adventure, knowing he has only a few more left. It does have the feel of those tail-end films by aging filmmakers who were past their prime but still mounting epics in the 60s. Maybe he would explain that we're seeing through the narrator's eyes, the world as Persian poem on evanescent love, arrested love as a deeper kind of love. Ridley Scott was briefly considered to direct, no doubt there would be sweeps of battle. Something he couldn't do and Herzog does, in a strange coup, is that it's a very sweet film about yearning. I would like to rest here. I wouldn't trust the film to be stating too much but for what it's worth; here's a Herzog tract that swaps feverish ego in the pursuit of futile escape from the confines of the world with a heart that submits to the world being confined thus and so and this doesn't stop it from journeying freely. Islamic poets make a big deal of this, acquiescing to be simply a vessel for luminous mystery. Maybe re-read on that Rumi than get it here. One last word. Herzog's work is done really. His journey has been vast but is coming to a close. Rather than pounce on him for a film like this, take from his legacy. Don't be a tourist of being, a sherpa of other peoples' reality. We're living in interesting times that require courageous clarity. And I write this after finding out that IMDb have decided to close down their message boards. It has been a decade for me, more for others. I'm not one for goodbyes, but maybe this one time. Something by way of farewell to people we won't be seeing each other in some time. Friends, visiting the Mausoleum of Poets in Tabriz wouldn't make you one, not visiting wouldn't stop you. There comes a day when you are called to the back door, going out, you will never be seen again. Learn how to move towards, how to move away, there's no other art. A tree is useful for someone who comes to chop it for firewood or turn it into furniture. May you come to rest in the shade of having less use for things that don't make the heart grow fond :)",
         "This is a story for women. If you live or have experienced the desert, you can connect with this story. Written as a romantic adventure, full of life and sadness, this movie tells a story that is subtle, not raw, nor, overly dramatized. It is a modern account with elements that are reminiscent of an older style of cinema. Tactile a full of beauty, Kidman's representation of Bell is simple and her prose lingers in your mind once the film has ended. 'Queen of the Desert' is, simply put, a very enjoyable adventure and, a representation of a strong, intelligent and formidable woman. This film is a poignant picture of a past that is little remembered beyond the borders of the desert region. Perhaps, it paints an image of the past that few choose to recognize or remember but, it is, albeit, an interesting an poignant one.",
         "This a movie that elevates the spirit and expands your horizons. It invites to beautiful scenery of the desert and its people. Captivating music enhances your experience. You will be glad you spent two hours watching this movie, preferably with you significant other or a friend, as you will want to talk to somebody about it. You will also want to read a book about Gertrude Bell and about the Middle East after watching ... ideally visit there as well although most places (Syria, Iraq, Iran) are too dangerous to travel to. Needless to say if you are into zombies, senseless violence and action, you will be disappointed. By the way, as some have said this is probably the most accessible and viewer friendly film by W. Herzog ... I hope there are more to come. Lastly N. Kidman is a great actress and a treat to watch ... but it is true that she was neither the right age nor the right person for this role (too fragile). Still both my wife and me enjoyed her screen presence.",
         "This film tells the story of a British woman who travels around Arabia to understand the life in the vast desert. She is undeterred by dangers of war, gangs and thieves. The last Warner Herzog film I watched was over ten years ago, and I did not enjoy the experience. \"Queen of the Desert\", fortunately, is way better than I expected it to be. The scenery of the desert is mesmerising, while the people it portrays are very interesting and very different from the Western civilisation. Cinematography is beautiful, and the film is hence a pleasant experience to watch. I also like the romance between Gertrude and the two gentlemen. It is rather unfortunate that her life is not rewarded with happiness on the romantic aspect. I enjoyed watching this film.",
         "7.75 of 10. Insightful film into why the Middle East is structured as it is. Based on the true story of Gertrude Bell, it brings history to life, even though it could have used a replacement for Nicole Kidman playing Gertrude as a young woman. Nevertheless, Nicole and makeup and post-production smoothing actually makes her look much younger than you'd expect and it doesn't detract from the film as a whole. Set while the UK was still the empire of the world before and during World War 1, it's not a war film. It gives a look beyond the religions into the cultures and ways of the region. It also shows a rarity at the time in a woman explorer and writer having a great deal of impact on the politics of the region. Surprisingly relevant to today's ongoing conflicts in the Middle East in addition to the underlying animosity and lack of respect for Germany in Europe that may have provided part of the source for World War 2 and Germany's animosity for the people of the region. The other surprising element is the exploration of how people entertained themselves and communicated in the early 1900s. It's a world without phones, radio, TV, computers, and the Internet.",
         "Film Review: \"Queen of the Desert\" (2015) Working with major Hollywood stars on a frequent basis since 2005 with directing Christian Bale through \"Rescue Dawn\" (2006), confronting Nicolas Cage with inner demons in \"Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans\" (2009) and given the antagonist \"The Zec\" for Tom Cruise's interpreted character of \"Jack Reacher\" (2012), Director Werner Herzog collaborates with actress Nicole Kidman to make her a living goddess by using the chronicles of real-life character Gertrude Bell (1868-1926) to find poetic beginnings and a roundup ending for a passionate picture of a woman connecting to her inner state within nature. The director loses all the ongoing hooks and suspense twists in between, especially due to a miscast actor James Franco as Gertrude Bell's love-interest Henry Cadogan, leaving Nicole Kidman struggling through an early 2014 shooting period, which she, due to her professionalism and decades of filmmaking experience, resolved for herself by wrap time, leaving the much-more documentary solid director Werner Herzog with another unbalanced motion picture narration of missed opportunities. © 2017 Felix Alexander Dausend (Cinemajesty Entertainments LLC)",
         "I stared in disbelief as Nicole Kidman entered and I was expected to believe she was a young maybe early 20's woman. I love her don't get me wrong, but that was beyond any sense of reality. Her simpering sugary overly acted \"love\" affair with Franco made me gag on it's sugary soft spoken sweetness and Franco always looked like he was about to turn to the camera and say, just joking wah wah wah. I don't even know what this movie was supposed to be about as my mind kept straying to other things. Should I go to the grocery store or just order a pizza. Should I do laundry now or wear an outfit I don't really like but is clean for work tomorrow. What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow. At about the halfway mark I threw in the towel and just looked up the actual woman. Her biography was far more interesting than this tripe that the director wanted to go who knows where.",
         "Although it's not Lawrence of Arabia, and Robert Pattinson suffers from O'Toole comparison, director Werner Herzog still brings to life the hitherto little-known heroine, Gertrude Bell (Nicole Kidman). Her exploits at the beginning of the 20th century helped cast a favorite light on Bedouins and Druses as she moved among them and helped negotiate the end-of-WWI land split in Arabia and environs. Herzog will have to suffer my criticism that remembers his crazed but magnetic wild men like Aguirre and Fitzcaraldo. Queen lacks the energy in his many stories of madmen like Aguirre. Here, while Nicole appears aristocratic and smart, she never rises above the thoughtful scholar or emerging anthropologist. Alas, too much is the time spent with the two loves of her life and not enough time among the tribes and diplomats she had to corral to get her inside unknown territory. Why must women in movies still be defined by the men they love? Herzog is not at his best with virtually half the film watching her dance around the Tehran Embassy diplomat, Henry Cadogan (James Franco), and the British officer, Charles Doughty-Wylie (Damian Lewis). Herzog misses the more romantic possibilities of her involvement in the war effort in favor of two not very interesting romances. That her loves tend toward their suicide hints at the powerful woman who could have sparked these annihilations. Kidman, a fine actress who gives a nuanced performance here, is mostly directed to play coy more than adventuresome.",
         "Could be a reasonably good movie but suffered from hasty character development, incoherent story, nonsense incidents and very poor production. Let's see how 1. We have an adventurous girl, Doesn't want to get married and is sent to British embassy in Tehran, Iran. Here comes the big initial blow. Tehran is not a tropical or even subtropical city, there are no palm trees in Tehran. Very few scenes are depicting the actual city and in those rare scenes, people wearing Keffiyeh (Arabic hat) which is not worn in Iran. Also the architecture was Arabic/north African. Before delivering such an incorrect historical image to audience, The producer could go on Youtube and watch some period Iranian movies and Mini-series such as Hezardastan to get the feel of Iran and Tehran in that period. They could also negotiate to use the existing Old- Tehran prop in Iran for accurate production and I saw no reason for Iranian officials to deny such request as the movie had no anti-Iranian content. 2. So she began to learn Farsi, good for her but Farsi is known to be a hard language for foreigners, takes years to be learnt as second language. It belongs to Indo-European language branch and is fundamentally different than Arabic. So she wishes to learn Farsi, then he jumps into Arabic countries venturing into deserts? If you are in love with Farsi and Persian Poems and you wish to learn Farsi in that purpose, you normally wonder in Iran which is mountains and woods with some areas of Desert not as vast as deserts in Arabic countries. So either the real historical figure had mental instability or the director assumed one can jump from Farsi to Arabic! 3. She literally is jumping from Iran to the Arabian desert. We see no transformation. 4. Bedouin tribes have no respect for women, they rape before they say hi! Yet she wonders among them without any support from British military gaining their respect... really??? 5. We see that the squeezed T.E.Lawrence into the movie. We have no reference of this lady in Lawrence Of Arabia movie yet in this movie Lawrence plays a reasonably major role. If Gertrude Bell was an important historical figure, there would have been a reference of her in Lawrence movie, so I assume she was not! 6. British Arab whatever headquarter in Cairo looks like a modern oriental themed hotel and I guess it really is! The producer did not even think for a moment that how a British establishment would have looked in those days! Shortcomings of the movie are huge and movie has no message, no goal, just a plain narrative of an obscure supposed to be real figure. NOT RECOMMENDED!",
         "This could have been a great movie, showing the beauty of the desert and its people but there were too many distractions that made it not so enjoyable. I would like to have seen more of her work in the desert. First off, the acting. While I love James Franco this is not the role for him. He wasn't convincing at all and his acting was weak. I don't love Robert Pattison but I didn't expect such horrible acting from him. The worst part for me, though, was the terminology. How can anyone expect a Bedouin sheik in 1915 to use the words \"a lot\"? Even nowadays many Beduoin who speak English would never use those words. They'd say \"much\" or \"many\". \"A lot\" wasn't generally used in everyday speech in those times, and definitely not by British aristocracy. Maybe some street kids in New York used the term, so is that where these Bedouins learned their English? I don't understand how filmmakers can be so careless. Read the damn script, then figure it out. If you're making a historical piece, make it jibe to the times.",
         "This film is a massive disappointment from this director. Prior to this horrible film, I actually loved mr. Herzog. Complete and utter failure on all fronts. The awful acting tops this miserable work. Especially their choice to cast the role of fula. The actor (jay Aboud?) is over the top with his mellow drama and stupid facial gestures. I strongly think his energy brought down Kidman's abilities as an actor. How absurd this whole journey was and that's what makes it most disappointing. Throughout the film the main character is revered for no reason whatsoever. Her supposed insight of knowing the Arabs does not justify the means utilized to elevate this character. The melodrama will certainly put you to sleep and will make you wonder what you are still doing in the theatre. Filled with arrogance and preaching unrealistically to sophisticated viewers has certainly put a nail in that coffin. Very Poorly acted, poorly written, poorly conceptualised and most thoroughly boring.",
         "Some very vague spoilers ( I really tried not to say anything that one does not know, if you know something about G.Bell's life) Despite the beautiful scenery and acting (on some parts), I was thoroughly disappointed by how the story reduced a formidable woman to just a little more than her feelings for men. Yes, a love interest sells and Ms Bell was romantically involved, however,the movie fails to portray what made Gertrude Bell the \"Queen of the desert\" and completely leaves out her political achievements, most of which still influence the world today. Why not show how she gained the respect of the different clans? Why not show the misery she witnessed?And most importantly: Why not show how she assisted in establishing Iraq, Jordan and Arabia, instead of simply mentioning it in the end? I mean, she had the unofficial title of \"maker of kings\" and \"queen of the desert\"!! The movie completely fails in showing why she deserved these titles. They depict her as a traveler, but hardly as an influencer, that part gets mentioned right at the end, but is never shown, which is a grave shame. While the desert scenery is hauntingly beautiful and some of the character interactions are interesting, I had expected so much more from a biographical movie about such an interesting person. And not to be too feminist about it, but had she been a man and had a movie been made about it, I am sure they would have focused much more on his adventures and much less on his love life.",
         "DEAR IMDb I was very disappointed watching this movie! this movie neglects a very important period life of ms bell in IRAQ, where she lived many many years after establishing the royal era in IRAQ in 1921. Ms bell had a major rule in IRAQ's politics and she was RESPONSIBLE FOR given IRAQI Sunni's the major rule. she WAS GIVEN THE (Duchess OF ALWIYAH)when she established a private country club which was private for the Britt's in Baghdad (Alwiyah club) and no IRAQI's were allowed till 1961! as a viewer I expected that more than half of the movie would tell the story of her life in IRAQ !! ms bell had the respect of all the parties and politicians in IRAQ for her great performance in the life of all IRAQIS"
