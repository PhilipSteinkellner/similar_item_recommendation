      "synopsis": "A young boy is discovered living in the basement of a house where an old woman has died. The boy, Jeremy Reed (Sean Patrick Flanery), has the name \"Powder\" because of his luminous white skin. It turns out that Powder has spent his whole life never leaving the house. The basement is fill wall to wall with books that he has not only read, but memorized every word. This is only the first hint at his incredible powers. Sheriff Barnum (Lance Henriksen) takes Powder to the local boys home until it can be determined if he might have other kin or what is to become of him. Powder is very unlike the other kids and becomes the object of their ridicule. But soon strange events begin to occur. It turns out that Powder can attract objects and bend them with his thoughts. He is able to conduct electrical energy around him. These actions makes other begin to fear him. Deputy Harley Duncan (Brandon Smith) is a macho man and expert deer hunter and he takes the boys on a deer hunt. Duncan never misses and sure enough he shoots a deer, but Powder grabs his hand and then touches the dying deer. Duncan can feel \"the pain\" of the deer dying. He is completely sickened by the event and gives away all his guns and will never hunt again. The one person who tries to help Powder is Jessie (Mary Steenburgen) and she arranges for him to take some aptitude and intelligence tests. After the tests, Powder comes into the room with the officials and they are all skeptical of him. He simply says to them that he knows they don't believe he could score so well without cheating. As he begins to leave the room, all the lights in the room explode. Sheriff Barnum's wife, Emma (Danette McMahon) is in a coma and the sheriff doesn't know what to do. Jessie asks Powder to go to her and see if he can help. Powder touches Emma and begins to share her thoughts with the sheriff. He tells the sheriff that she needs to go and he must say it's ok before she can. The sheriff breaks down and nods and his wife dies. It becomes increasing clear that Powder will never \"fit in\" and so he runs away and goes back to the house where he was raised. Jessie, Donald Ripley (Jeff Goldblum) and the Sheriff Barnum go after him. There is an approaching thunder storm and as they chase Powder into the field, the lightening strikes get closer and closer. Suddenly, Powder is hit by a strike and is vaporized into thin air. Suddenly the storm stops and all is quiet. Powder is gone.",

         "It is rare that I see a movie as unforgettable and unpredictable as Powder. I am not a man who is easily impressed with special affects, but in this movie the affects always served a purpose instead of covering up the fact that there was no purpose. In an age where movies have become multiple scenes of graphic violence and corny excuses for stories, Powder is refreshing, filled with the meaning of humanity, and moved me to tears throughout the entire film. With most films, I am able to predict exactly what will happen and when. With Powder I could never quite tell what was going to happen next, and the ending was something I would have never imagined would happen and could only be described as extraordinary. There are so many elements to this movie: The paranormal; the challenge to everything we think we know about science and the capabilities of the human mind; the human capacity for cruelty; love and forgiveness; and the hope that our own humanity will one day advance beyond our own technology. Most of all, the raw emotion of this great masterpiece reaches deep into the heart and leaves an impression that stays with you. This is one of those rare movies that you will never forget, a true classic that illustrates truths about humanity that have existed since the beginning of time.",
         "The movie 'Powder' is a return to innocence. It possesses a spiritual quality that opens the eyes to life. And it lends a soothing note to those questions for which their seems to be more questions and few answers. Sean Patrick Flannery's performance was so powerful that one could actually feel the unconditional love within the heart and soul of the character that he played. The concepts that were brought forward, the passion that came with every dramatic scene, and the sense of realism and truth made it one of the most thought provoking movies of all time. Powder was not based on a true story, but it is, I feel, everybody's true story in some way, and it is as powerful, passionate, and inspirational as any true story I have ever seen. Some viewers may wish to begrudge the apparent perfection portrayed by the lead character. However, his only perfection was the way he searched so deep, often at great personal expense, for the suppressed perfection in everyone, and the hidden perfection in everything. I was somewhat disappointed by how the family quality of the movie was spoiled by the use of language by the school bully. Still, a must see for anybody who enjoys a thought provoking film once in a while. Even if you're a person who would prefer to sit down with a good book, as am I, the movie 'Powder' is definitely worth your time. In conclusion: 'Powder' is one of my favourite movies of all time. Seconded, in my opinion, only to 'The Boondock Saints'; also starring Sean Patrick Flannery.",
         "I have taken in hand the constructive criticism of others about this film. I've noticed that most people don't like the film because of Salva's criminal record. That's no reason to give it ill-repute. The film itself is a little dodgy in parts and could have used some better acting from some of its stars. Sean Patrick Flanery does an amazing job as Jeremy Reed, and I believe he was well-suited for the part. I didn't like Lance Henriksen's acting at all. I thought that the way he portrayed the character was a little too repetitive and boring. But then again, I don't care for him as an actor anyway. I think he's crotchety, annoying, and outdated; and the characters he chooses to play reminds me of the acclaim that Robert Redford always gets - undeserved. The film is about a young man who suffers a birth \"defect\" after his pregnant mother is struck by lightning and killed. OK, I can understand some of this. He is raised by grandparents who soon begin to fear him and show him no emotion - not unlike his father. When his last grandparent dies he is left alone for a short period of time before he is discovered by the police. Our main character is highly intelligent, scared, telekinetic, and has an electric personality, not to mention he's an albino, too. A social worker, Jessica, played by Mary Steenburgen is called to take over the boy's case and he is placed in a group living situation in a home. He is placed with delinquents and abandoned children who have no respect for him. I love Steenburgen and think she always does a good part in any film she is in. She's a fine actress, and though she may not be classed as \"dazzlingly\" beautiful, her charms show through no matter what character she plays. She's heart-warming, endearing, and always brings a good sense of love to a film. Those who say that Salva's sexual undertones are present in the film can be dismissed right away. I knew nothing of Salva's past when I watched this film for the first time, and I noticed nothing out of the ordinary. Goldblum's character, who is a science teacher and befriends the boy, does a good job of interacting with him. He's not molesting him or harming him by holding his hand and giving him a long-needed hug. If you're assuming this shows sexual predators at work, I think you need to see the therapist, not Salva. Also, the scene in which he is looking at another boy who is in the locker room is not about lust. He is longing to be able to do normal things that others do without being ridiculed. If you'll remember, it's the very next scene where they tell him he's a freak who is as \"bald as a baby.\" He just wants to fit in, and it is at this point that I believe he realizes he doesn't. Overall, this film does bring a sense of wonder to the viewer. If you sit back and take it all in, Salva is showing us what might happen if we all stop judging one another and start accepting human beings for their uniqueness. He's not trying to make you accept him for being a child predator. He's showing the world that people are ALL different, and if we spent a little less time being so blocked and full of hate, we might come to realize this and appreciate the aesthetic value of the human soul. I gave this film a 7 out of 10 because I didn't like Lance Henriksen's performance at all, I thought some of the characters could have come through in the end (Why didn't his love interest stand up for herself against her father? Why were there loose strings here?), and I would have liked to have seen more \"after the fact\" wrap-ups when Jeremy becomes raw energy in the film's climax. Also, why in God's name does Powder have eyelashes if he is unable to grow hair? Huh? What? OK, so Sean does have pretty eyes, but, come on! On a side note, for those of you who think that the Deputy Sheriff's character was a \"stereotypical\" cop character, giving the police a bad name...I have relatives who are police in a small town like this one, and you should hear THEM talk over the dinner table. It ISN'T much different.",
         "A story that encapsulates where we as a race are heading for a very bad outcome indeed. As clearly stated in the film by Jeff Goldblum's character, \" when technology surpasses humanity\". We as a species are in severe danger and crisis over how we perceive what our lives are truly about. We are losing our humanity by advancements in our technology that serve only to relieve us of harnessing our one true purpose that makes us unique within our humanity........Choice. The film also shows that a pure and unique individual is not accepted within those who are already lost of their own humanity. I find myself relating to 'powder' in many ways, albeit minus his physical and other obvious electrical abilities. But I do understand his humanity and choice to make humane decisions that do affect all of us. And his feeling of isolation and not 'fitting in' to his fellow kind. Hopefully one day we can be at a point where our humanity will rise above our technological demands, otherwise we are on a roller-coaster ride to self destruction. Good film,good message.",
         "If someone explained the plot of Powder to me, I would assume it was some sappy, simple, over emotional clap trap, from someone like Spielberg. Yet when I actually saw the film, I found it to be deep, intelligent and very moving. There are some things wrong with the film, a number of the characters are stereotypes and some parts of the plot are a little unexpected. If you ignore these simple problems, the quality of the direction and acting shine through, to provide an excellent film. I very rarely say this, but I think, Sean Patrick Flanery's performance is one the most remarkable I have ever seen. Tender and awkward, without looking false. Overall an excellent film, but maybe for the more mature viewer.",
         "I love this movie. Beautiful, amazing, heartwarming. It just goes to prove, looks are worthless. I cry several times throughout this movie every time I watch it.Wonderful movie, period! (Not to mention he's physically attractive, but thats another story all together.) But man, I wish it were real! The most odd looking people are usually the most intelligent and kind. That proves correct in most cases. I feel his sadness watching him, and the beginning is heartbreaking. The other characters in the movie, I really dislike for their treatment of him. Ignorance is bliss, but harmful. But I don't see how these other people can rate it a 5. something! I can't comprehend that, there is nothing wrong with it!",
         "Sean Patrick Flanery, better known as Indiana Jones in the several \"Young Indiana Jones\" films, plays \"Powder\", an albino whose mother was struck by lightning right before he was born. Mom died, dad disowned him, and Powder grew up in the basement of his grandparents' home, learning everything into his teenage years just by reading books. And he knew every book, down to being able to recite anything on any page! He is discovered after his one remaining grandparent dies. He is evaluated and put into a home for boys. Being unpigmented and totally hairless, everyone stares at him, and the bullies in school treat him badly. It is discovered that he has the highest I.Q. ever recorded, and when an \"educator\" asks him if he knows what that means, he replies, \"If you really believe that about me, why are you asking me that question?\" Good script writing. In a very powerful scene, after a deer is shot, Powder touches the deer and grasps the hunter, and transfers the feelings such that the hunter feels what the deer feels as it dies. That realization totally changes the man, one of the local deputies. Another is when Powder helps the sheriff understand what his dying wife wants, which turns out only for the father and son to reconcile. Jeff Goldblum, like every movie he is in, is the \"scene stealer\" in each scene he is in. He is such a good actor, especially when he plays a scientist, as he does here. he realizes that Powder is something special, and closer to being \"pure energy\" than anyone before. His classroom demo of \"Jakob's Ladder\" goes haywire when all the electricity is attracted towards Powder, literally lifting him off the floor. Which was a sign of things to come, during the interaction with lightning during the final scene. \"Powder\" is an absorbing film, obviously fictional, but thought-provoking. I rate it a strong \"8\" of 10. This film uses the albinism and electrical energy as a vehicle to explore the concept of \"different\", and works the issue of how far humanity needs to come to respect each other, and especially embrace each others' differences. Mary Steenburgen is cast as the social worker who first rescues Powder from the cellar, and who tries to find a way for him to live a normal life.",
         "I have not seen any of Victor Salva's movies before until now. He is also the director of the recent horror film Jeepers Creepers. The actors are all quite good: Mary Steenburgen as the woman that tries to help, Lance Henriksen as the local sheriff, Jeff Goldblum as the science teacher, and especially Sean Patrick Flanery as Powder. The movie can be classified in a number of ways: uplifting drama, family picture, and horror. There are strong moments of absolute emotional power, beauty, and humanity as Powder tries to fit in amongst the local people, but ends up teaching them lessons about humanity instead. Powder's appearance seemed even Chaplin-like at times, emoting with the slightest variances in expressions like a mime. Like many uplifting family movies, Powder was hard to find. I had never heard of it before and wonder if it was ever in theaters even. I don't think the script was developed enough and it was a bit predictable at times. I would rate it a PG-13 movie because of the intensity in some scenes and innuendo in the bullying. Teenagers, who feel they don't fit in, will strongly identify with Powder and will probably love this movie. However, this is also a horror movie, but a different kind of horror movie. At first it seems to follow in Carrie's shoes, setting up a revenge plot. But the horror we see isn't a misfit student getting revenge in unspeakable ways on classmates. It's in the town's inability to treat Powder with humanity. *** of 4 stars.",
         "I honestly can't understand why some people disliked, or even hated this movie. I absolutely adore this movie. I think the acting is great (but then I again, I happen to love both Jeff Goldbloom and Lance Henrickson), and I also feel that Sean Patrick Flanery put on an awesome performance. This movie resonates with anyone who was the underdog in school, as I, and many were when they were young. The story is touching, emotional, and liberating. I don't think I've ever watched this once without crying. Add to that the spectactular soundtrack (which some movie-watchers often overlook), and this movie is right up there on my own \"Best of All Times\" list. If you haven't seen this, I only ask that you ignore the negative comments until you've had the chance to watch it yourself and make up your own mind... you might be pleasantly surprised.",
         "Sean Patrick Flannery is an incredibly under rated actor after this remarkable performance he gave in \"Powder\", while the story is very dark and just not pleasant, he really gave it his all into this film and you can see how emotionally connected he is in it. We also have Mary Steinberg and Jeff Goldblum who give their all into their characters, I just think they were not that well developed enough. They could have had a little more. The movie starts off with a mother and father rushing into labor, only on the way, unfortunately is struck by listening in a massive thunderstorm. She does not survive, but the baby does and the father is not only devastated but rejects his son. Sean plays Jeremy or as most people call him, \"Powder\" due to him being an albino. He is hidden in his grandparent's basement and has never been out of the house. When his grandmother passes, Jessica Caldwill, played by Mary Steinberg, convinces Jeremy that he must leave and they'll give him and home and school to attend. He does leave and slowly progresses towards what he thinks may be a better life. When Donald Ripley, a school teacher, has the I.Q. results for Jeremy for his school, he is amazed. There is no score high enough for Jeremy, he's smarter than Albert Einstein. He can memorize book pages word for word, he knows agonizing math problems, and knows the pain of the world. He also has a mysterious power where he if he is exposed to electricity, he gets electrocuted. He also has the power to make people feel the same pain as they inflicted unto another, he also can read minds. Unfortunately, this isn't making him very popular with the jocks of the school who brutally torment him not just mentally but physically. There is only really Donald, Jessica, and another girl Lidnsey who want to be his friends. Only he's just not willing to except this world of pain when so many people doubt and torture him like Doug Barnum who is the town's sheriff and just thinks Jeremy is a freak. His wife is unfortunately dying and comes to Jeremy to ask for a favor and to help him find out what his wife wants. This scene is so extremely touching and tearful. The scene that got to most to me is when the boys go on a hunting trip and the coach shoots a deer for sport and are just laughing at this poor deer dying. Jeremy then takes his hand on the deer and his other hand on the coach and the coach starts to have somewhat of a seizure, and he made the coach feel the same pain he put on the deer. Poetic justice and well deserved I thought. \"Powder\", despite being depressing, is a pretty decent picture worth viewing if you are in the mood for a sappy flick. But trust me, it is worth the it, you get a great performance that deserved more praise by Sean, also the same with Mary and Jeff. The acting just takes this movie to where it should be. 7/10"
