         "This is a somewhat interesting documentary which I mainly found interesting because I am a bit of geek. I do feel however the whole piece was not particularly reviling of any subject in particular, they should have focused on at least some more areas including the relationship of the founders in a more critical way, how it is for the music industry now (perhaps talked to some current more relevant people than Liam Gallagher about it, maybe some current Record company folk or perhaps the current opinions in more detail of Metallica,Dr Dre or Snoop Lion), what is currently using the same sort of technology, how the same thing is happening in the Movie industry and what they have done about it also perhaps some explanation of the technology involved in some level of details. I am not disappointed as it was much better than the average National Geographic level of documentary, but it could have been better.",
         "A documentary that explores the downloading revolution; the kids that created it, the bands and the businesses that were affected by it, and its impact on the world at large. Who can ever get enough David Boies! This film needed more Boies. Also, it was great to see Sean Parker evolve from teenage geek to slick, young entrepreneur. While Shawn Fanning has largely dropped off the map, Parker is a story all in himself, with his various projects (including Facebook) and involvement with the CIA (which was ignored in this film). Alan Scherstuhl of The Village Voice states: \"The doc is only about as revealing as a middling magazine article on the subject.\" There is truth to that. Nothing here will be shocking for those who followed the story when it happened, but it is nice to see the story arc all in one place.",
         "\"Downloaded\" is the story of Shawn Fanning and his revolutionary creation - Napster. This one has a star-studded cast and at a glance could be either very interesting or very boring. The plus side is that you can get everyone's side to the debate. When I finished watching this, I was a little disappointed. Felt like they hadn't focused on the impact that this caused throughout the industry in quite the right light. Some might disagree. I saw this one and several other music-themed docs at the Canadian International Doc Festival \"Hot Docs\". Wayne from Metalworks Studios mentioned his first impressions on a few I couldn't find the time to see: http://metalworksstudios.com/news/blog/item/81-music-documentaries"
