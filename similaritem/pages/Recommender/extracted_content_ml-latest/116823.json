      "synopsis": "Katniss Everdeen ( Jennifer Lawrence), victor of the 74th and 75th Hunger Games, has been brought to safety in a large underground facility together with Gale ( Liam Hemsworth), her mother ( Paula Malcomson) and her sister Primrose ( Willow Shields). She is being tormented by nightmares from her double ordeal in the arenas. Her co-tribute Finnick Odair ( Sam Claflin) is also at the base, apparently suffering from post-traumatic stress, while fearing for the life of his girlfriend Annie. Katniss is summoned by general Boggs ( Mahershala Ali). He tells her that District 13, where they are currently residing, was bombed by the Capitol 75 years ago in retaliation over their part in the rebellion. However, unbeknownst to the Capitol, the survivors managed to build an underground bunker below the ruins. Katniss is brought to District 13's president Alma Coin ( Julianne Moore) and Plutarch Heavensbee ( Philip Seymour Hoffman), former Capitol Gamemaker who turned out to be an unexpected ally to the rebels. Coin expresses her admiration for Katniss' bravery, as well as her sympathy for the destruction of District 12. She explains that Katniss destroying the live feed during the previous Hunger Games has sparked a mass rebellion in the Districts. However, she believes that a war can only be successful if all Districts are fully united against their common enemy, the mighty Capitol. Since Katniss has become the embodiment of the Mockingjay, the unofficial symbol of the rebellion, they want her to do a series of propaganda films to win over those people who do not yet dare to take sides against the Capitol. Katniss angrily refuses, reproaching Heavensbee for leaving Peeta in the arena at the mercy of the Capitol. He convinces Coin that Katniss should be allowed to take a look in the ravaged District 12 to see the importance of her participation. When she leaves, Coin voices her doubts about Katniss' resolve. President Snow ( Donald Sutherland) is preparing a speech to address the nation. He decides to downplay the significance of the rebellion in order to show off his strength, according to his philosophy that one should never be seen bleeding by one's enemies. Furthermore, he has several captured rebels publically executed and proclaims that any association with the Mockingjay symbol is henceforth punishable by death. Katniss learns that District 13 has been stockpiling weapons for years, preparing for a possible war with the Capitol. She is taken to District 12 by plane, where she discovers to her horror that hardly any building is still standing, and the bodies of numerous dead people are still lying between the rubble. Her former house in Victor's Village has been spared; she finds her sister's cat, some personal belongings, as well as the white rose given to her by president Snow the year before. Katniss returns to District 13 and gives the cat to her sister, stating that she probably cannot keep it. Suddenly, there is a broadcast from the Capitol; Peeta Mellark ( Josh Hutcherson) is giving an exclusive interview to Caesar Flickerman ( Stanley Tucci). Although apparently in good health, he shows signs of being mistreated. He implies that Katniss had been planning to sabotage the Hunger Games and incite rebellion all along; he urges people to surrender and lay down their arms, and is immediately branded a traitor by the inhabitants of District 13. Katniss goes to Coin to tell her she agrees to be the Mockingjay, on the condition that Peeta and the other prisoners of the Capitol are rescued and pardoned. Coin refuses, as District 13 believes in fair trials, and Peeta should answer for his betrayal. Katniss furiously retorts that the Capitol may be abusing and torturing him into cooperation, and refuses to participate if he isn't rescued; her determination convinces Coin and Heavensbee that she has re-found her old vigor. Coin agrees to her terms as long as Katniss provides results (she also grants Katniss' request that Primrose can keep her cat). That night, Katniss learns that Coin's husband and children have died several years back during an epidemic that plagued the facility. Coin officially announces Katniss as the face of the rebellion to a cheering crowd, although the people seem dismayed by her intention to pardon Peeta. Katniss starts a series of propaganda films under the direction of Heavensbee, but her improvisation skills are far from convincing. Haymitch Abernathy ( Woody Harrelson), who has been following a mandatory rehab program, notices that Katniss always makes the strongest impression in spontaneous situations, so he suggests that she be sent into the field as a soldier, under protection at all times, where a crew can shoot propaganda footage of her while in action. Effie Trinket ( Elizabeth Banks), who has also been brought to District 13 where she loudly complains about the lack of luxury, is summoned to be part of Katniss' stylist team. She brings clothing designs from Cinna, who was killed by the Capitol, but not before he designed a Mockingjay costume for Katniss that emphasizes her role as the symbolic leader of the rebellion. Beetee ( Jeffrey Wright), Katniss' other fellow victor who is now wheelchair-bound, reveals that he once worked on designing the Capitol's defenses and broadcast system, and has therefore found a way to hack into the Capitol's news channel. He has also made a sophisticated bow and explosive arrows for Katniss to use while on tour. Gale will come along as her bodyguard. Katniss meets her film crew, led by Cressida ( Natalie Dormer) and her team of Capitol refugees who include her assistant Messalla (Evan Ross), director Castor (Wes Chatham), and cameraman Pollux (Elden Henson), who is an Avox and therefore cannot speak since The Capitol had his tongue cut out. They fly over to District 8 where she visits a hospital full of wounded rebels. They are visibly surprised and delighted by her visit. One person asks about Katniss' baby; after some hesitation, she answers that she has lost it. She praises the rebels for their courage and encourages them to continue the fight, but then an incoming squadron of Capitol jets starts bombing the compound. Katniss and Gale successfully fight off the jets, but the planes manage to destroy the hospital, killing everyone inside. An emotionally devastated Katniss gives a powerful speech to the camera, telling Panem that president Snow will stop at nothing to win, even killing innocent victims, and can only be stopped if everyone supports the rebellion. She also assures him that all his acts of cruelty will be avenged. Back at District 13, the video is broadcast and Katniss and Gale are allowed to go hunting outside. Katniss takes aim at a large elk, but refuses to kill it, as the animal has apparently never been hunted before and refuses to run. Katniss admits that she is having a hard time being the poster girl for the rebellion, drawing thousands of people into the war and into their deaths. They share a moment of intimacy before returning home. The next stop is another visit to District 12. Gale tells on camera that on the night of Katniss' victory at the 75th Hunger Games, he heard how all the Peacekeepers withdrew from the area. Knowing what would come, he tried to evacuate as many people as possible, but as District 12 was bombed, many of its population of 10,000 perished in the destruction. While taking a rest near a river, the crew notices a flock of mockingjays flying nearby that imitate every melody. Katniss is asked to sing a song, and she is filmed while singing \"The Hanging Tree\". The footage is broadcast on the news channel, and within a day, all rebels have adopted the tune as their protest song. An entire squad of Peacekeepers is wiped out by rebels in District 7, while another group destroys a large dam near the Capitol that provides electricity to the city. The main power of the Capitol is cut off, and with only back-up generators working, the city's defenses and broadcast capabilities are severely weakened. That night, Peeta gives another interview to Ceasar Flickerman. He looks emaciated and abused, yet again, he calls out at the rebels to stop their fighting and submit to the Capitol; however, when he notices that Beetee is disrupting the broadcast with another one of Katniss' propaganda films, he suddenly realizes she is still alive, and warns her that Capitol planes are flying towards her location. He is silenced and the broadcast is suddenly interrupted. All inhabitants of District 13 are quickly evacuated to the lower levels where they will hopefully be safe from the bombings. As the bombs start falling, Heavensbee urges president Coin to fire back; however, Coin chooses to sit the situation out, not yet wanting to reveal to the Capitol that they aren't as defenseless as they may seem. Meanwhile, Katniss notices that her sister has not come along to the shelter. She gets back to the upper level to find Primrose having returned for her cat. They get back into the shelter just before it locks down, with a long night ahead of them. The next morning, the bombs have stopped and District 13 has survived the attack. President Coin tells Katniss that thanks to Peeta, they had an eight-minute head start, ensuring a successful evacuation. In recognition of the personal risk he took, Coin has authorized a rescue mission to the Capitol to save Peeta and the others, with Boggs leading and Gale coming along. In the meanwhile, Katniss will tape another promotional film. While going outside into a bomb crater, Katniss notices that hundreds of white roses have been dropped into the area. She interprets this as Snow reminding her of his threat last year, promising to kill all of Katniss' loved ones if she would not put up a charade. She immediately fears for Peeta's life and refuses to do any additional filming. Finnick takes her place, and as the rescue team crosses into the Capitol by helicopter without resistance, he tells the nation how he, as a victor of the Games, has learned many secrets. One of them is that president Snow rules by poison; during his rise to power, Snow systematically killed all those who could oppose him by offering them poisoned drinks, which he himself drank as well in order to not arouse suspicion. He used counter-agents to neutralize the poison, but their effect was incomplete, leaving him with permanent sores in his mouth; to neutralize the smell, Snow is always surrounded by scented flowers. In the meanwhile, the rescue team has arrived at the Tribute Center. They enter and while making their way to the tributes, they traverse a sophisticated lab that seems to contain several torturing devices. When arriving at Peeta's location, the power to the Capitol is suddenly restored, and Beetee can no longer get into the power grid. Fearing the worst for the rescue team, Katniss wants to make an attempt to distract president Snow. She allows Beetee to connect her to president Snow himself, who eventually responds. She tries to convince him that she isn't the Mockingjay everyone claims her to be. It was never her intention to sabotage the Games and incite a rebellion, she just wanted her family and friends to be safe. Snow seems almost sympathetic to her words, but cryptically remarks that it is the things one cares about that becomes one's downfall. He tells her that he no longer believes this charade of innocence, and makes it very clear that he knows about the current rescue attempt being undertaken. The transmission is cut off immediately; Katniss is devastated by his words. Hours later, she learns that the rescue team has miraculously returned and was successful. Boggs and Gale have rescued everyone, but they are at a loss to explain why the Capitol allowed them to escape unharmed. Joanna Mason ( Jena Malone) is back, apparently mistreated but feisty as ever, while Finnick is reunited with his girlfriend Annie. Katniss is being taken to Peeta, who looks emaciated but is otherwise fine. She tries to hug him, but he suddenly assaults her and chokes her within an inch of her life; Boggs can just barely knock him unconscious. Katniss awakes, badly bruised. Heavensbee tells her that Peeta has been 'hi-jacked': through psychological torture and hallucinatory tracker jacker venom, he has been conditioned to experience nothing but fear and hatred at the sight of Katniss, as Snow's ultimate revenge on her. They will start to work on him, but his recovery, if any, will be long and arduous. As Coin announces the return of the rescue team and the successful liberation of the prisoners to the people of District 13, Katniss sneaks into the medical facility where Peeta is being treated, and realizes to her horror that he is kept in isolation, complete psychotic and screaming in agony. To be continued...... After the end credits, the Mockingjay logo from The Hunger Games appears, turns into the Mockingjay logo from The Hunger Games: Catching fire, and then turns into the Mockingjay logo from The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1..... to finally transform into the free and flying Mockingjay logo in the book.",

         "Let me first note that I am an avid movie-goer, but not a reader of the books. I did, however, watch the first two Hunger Games movies and was pleasantly surprised by them. They kept my attention, with plot and performances intriguing and action-packed enough to get from one scene to the next without a dull moment. This latest installment is the exact opposite. The movie opens with some melodramatic scenes where Katniss (JLaw) suffers from previous trauma, then scene after scene just keeps rehashing the same weepy look on her face partnered with some sentimental background music. \"Remember how President Snow tried to kill everyone in our district? Sniff.\" followed by \"How could he do this again in this district? Sniff.\" then \"Why is he doing this to my friends? Sniff.\" over and over until the end. Imagine that for 2 hours. That is essentially this movie. Other scenes later on are just variations of the same - different scenery (a town in ruins, a mountain lake, a bomb shelter), different characters to ruminate with (the old flame Gale, old allies like Finnick and new ones like the District 13 folks, the sister Prim) - but they essentially are the same scene. I really wanted to tell the director the whole time: \"Ok I get it, they are all angry and hurt. Now what? Please advance the story.\" I understand this treatment is beneficial at the start to provide some exposition on how the characters are brewing in their discontent and how it all boils over later on, but that's also what the first two movies already established. To fill 2 hours of the supposedly climactic final chapter with further exposition is just too much, perhaps unless you truly are a solid fan and have the patience to wait it out. There was one final part in this movie that was intended to be a climax of sorts before the cliffhanger. It's the only scene that promises some sort of cathartic, action-packed sequence, but they skip the meat and flash-forward until after the event concludes. There were, however, some good scenes of rebels rousing here and there that were quite entertaining even if they were also just more exposition fodder. At least they reminded me to wake up from time to time. I think this is the unfortunate fault of the cash-grab strategy of trying to split the last book into two parts. The movie just feels so out of place with regards to momentum, which was a very positive thing going for the storyline in the first two movies. Even though Catching Fire was essentially just going back to the Hunger Games, it still felt fast and different enough to keep me tuned in. This movie managed to rehash itself endlessly and leave me feeling like nothing of gravity happened after my viewing experience... and it tried so hard to make me care via the melodrama, yet I am left unsold.",
         "Let me say it right now; I hated this movie. It was bad. Look, the concept of a being movie cut into two parts just does not work. The whole thing felt like a two-hour exposition. The first 30 minutes were so damn boring I literally could not stop getting out of focus and move uncomfortably in my seat. There really isn't anything special going on as it progresses, too. There is war going on, but they do not really show it and it doesn't suck you in. It's very slow paced with lots of teenage drama and not a lot of \"games\" or \"hunger\" as in the previous films (which I liked, by the way). And now there's Jennifer Lawrence's acting, which was trying too hard (while making lots of weird facial expressions that made me laugh at inappropriate moments). Overall, I think the idea of splitting a movie into two parts; thus making the first half boring, isn't a very good one. And in this particular movie \"not very good\" is a compliment. 3/10",
         "I had never heard the term \"set-up movie\" before today. There has definitely been a trend of splitting up a story into multiple movies. These movies don't have a beginning-middle-end the same way other movies do but at the very least there's some progress. The problem with the Mockingjay Pt 1 is not that it's boring or poorly made. In fact, there is a lot of excitement in this movie. The problem is that from beginning to end there is hardly anything that changes. If you look at where the characters are in the beginning and where they are in the end there isn't much that's changed except for what happens in the very end. Katniss has been doing things but we haven't seen much of the effects of her actions. I didn't dislike this movie that much despite it's slow beginning. I just can't give this my seal of approval when I left the theater feeling like I saw half a movie. By the time the story gets its payoff my memory of this movie will be worn-off.",
         "Like watching paint dry. Boring to a mind-numbing degree. How many times can we see Katniss be horrified and/or emotionally distraught? Maybe the filmmakers thought they were adding depth to their characters. Well, they were wrong. Instead we, the audience, sit through one scene after another in which really nothing happens at all. This whole thing could have easily been compressed down to 40 minutes and then we could have had the rest of the book as the rest of the film. This felt very much like they were stretching it out so they could make two movies - which is the new thing to do in Hollywood with these franchises. Not good storytelling.",
         "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 stars Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland,Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Julianne Moore. Just to get something straight I feel splitting a movie into two parts is dumb and studios do it just for more money and I find it irritating. Not every finale of a young adult novel needs to be two parts. That being said \"How is Mockingjay part 1? \" Is it a big step up from Catching fire? Frankly its pretty boring and basically a huge waste of time. Nothing really interesting happens in this movie. Bonding moments that don't need to happen between characters that feel pretty forced. Some dialogue and extra propaganda speeches to make the run time just a little bit longer. More characters that were throw in your face with really no character development at all. Katniss doesn't grow as a character from the last movie. Besides shooting an arrow at a jet which is shown in the trailer all Katniss really does is Propaganda Commercials and cry over things. Also all of the other characters that you already know you don't really care about them at all throughout this movie either. Really the only person you care about is Katniss kinda. Shaky cam has made a return from the first movie and isn't that why the change of director happened for the second movie? Wasn't the point to get rid of all that? I guess not. A couple of cool moments happen but that doesn't really help much. I mean the best parts of this movie were promoted in the trailer. Don't get me wrong this isn't an awful movie it's more of a very long trailer for Mockingjay part 2. What I did enjoy was all of the propaganda parts which was a nice change from all the killing in the first two movies and the last 15 minutes. A camera crew follows Katniss around to make propaganda commercials and then the capitol will fire back with their own propaganda stuff. It's a political fight. Honestly the propaganda concepts was really the only thing keeping me awake. I have to be honest I started to dose off a couple of times. The last 15 minutes it starts to build up and things start going down that makes it feel like the actual movie is fixing to start and it just ends. Kind of in the way The Desolation of Smaug did as well. Now you have to wait another year for the movie that you wanted to see in the first place. In the end i was really bored throughout this movie. This is just a waste of time to get more money out of the franchise. Even if your a fan of the novel wait till next November to see this movie so you can go see part 2 right after and pretend like part 1 doesn't exist.",
         "I am so disappointed of the movie. And that's because there happens close to nothing. At nearly every point you notice it's stretched for making out of one book two movies. At the beginning I liked it, because many parts of the book found their way into the movie. But I realised transferring the story of a book 1:1 into a movie isn't that good. (NO SPOILER) As an example they need about 5-10 minutes just to go down a staircase, back upwards because \"missing\" something and down again. And nothing really happens. All the time absolutely no excitement rose in me and I just got bored. And I am pretty sure this should be a part where your heartbeat is meant to been rising. Sure there are some nice and decent scenes but most of the stuff is just lame. In the book it works but clearly not in the Movie (plus the showdown of the book is missing because of the split). But at least I enjoyed the screenplay of Josh Hutcherson and Philip Seymour Hoffman, which lifted the Movie \"up\" to 3 Stars. I hope the last one gets back on the level of the first two movies.",
         "Great acting from the cast; especially Jennifer Lawrence, the characters were as believable and entertaining as they were in previous films, this is pretty much the highlight of the film. The plot however was dull and uneventful, as in nothing really went anywhere. in the majority of the film there was no tension; for the most part it was basically \"stuff happens in a bunker for 2 hours: The Movie.\" which is super disappointing because although I haven't read the books; I'm told by people that have that they skipped a bunch of the action and downplayed the apparent love triangle. If you wanted an action packed flick like the first two or you are the type of fan who doesn't like stuff in the book to be left out, you will be sorely disappointed as this is clearly a filler movie to get some extra $$$ before the series ends. wait for DVD.",
         "The screenwriter team for this movie was obviously under pressure to extend beyond reason the simplistic narrative of this movie. The result: over two hours of acting without substance. I cannot complain about the actors, for they did what they were paid to do, but COME ON, did it have to be so melodramatic and empty? Emotions are simply not credible, and only inspire scorn. I want my money back. I want my time back. What a waste of effort to extend this film beyond one installment. Had they compacted the movie in 1 hour, then probably all the bad cinematography would have been eliminated. Sure producers will make a profit at the expense of unsuspected viewers and several (perhaps demolishing) hits on actors careers. I will NOT view the last installment. I refuse to give my money away for nothing. The saddest part is that this movie could have been great. The acting talent was there. Technical resources were available. But he most inexpensive part of the production was neglected beyond belief: storytelling. The screenwriters in this movie are not idiots. It is obvious that artificial constraints were placed to extend the story to two parts. SAVE YOUR TIME, SAVE YOUR MONEY, DO NOT WATCH THIS BAD, BAD MOVIE.",
         "The first movie was fresh and entertaining. I've been dragged by my partner to watch the second one which I actually enjoyed until the end when I realized it was not finished yet. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is simply a jock. I've never been so much bored from a movie and at some point I really considered leaving the theater. The pace is slow, the acting terribly poor and every single scene predictable. Jennifer Lawrence's character has been stretched to the maximum. All she does is crying and pretending all movie long.I will not watch the part 2 in theater nor on TV as we all already know what will happen. This movie is perfect if you want to feel frustrated, disappointed and tricked.",
         "You may want to save your money and time seeing this movie and wait for the last installment to come out next year, instead. Aside from Jennifer Lawrence, this movie offers nothing more than just a long and tiring tale of preparation for an impending rebellion. Readers shouldn't get surprised: Mockingjay's first half chronicles District 13's efforts to groom Katniss as their heroine against the ruthless ruling Capitol. The process of transforming her into what they call the 'Mockingjay', a symbol of revolution, is engaging enough to ignite interest, but only up to a point, when long speeches and depictions of what the Hunger Games' downfall has caused, have almost become the only few things eating up the biggest slice of the movie's airtime pie. There is nothing much to see here, and while its refreshing to finally see the landscapes to have finally shifted away from the arenas, lack of action eventually makes the scenes that are almost only showing the events in the confinements, hard to appreciate, not to mention difficult to extract sense from. Fortunately, it has Jennifer Lawrence, and that alone, is enough to pull the entire movie away whenever it leans toward making the audience fall to sleep. Jennifer's charm proves to be the biggest asset of this movie, and she alone, singularly saves the film from being a total nonsense. Toward the end, it isn't clear whether the makers of the film have made their point (aside from making more money of course) in splitting the book into two movies. This first half only presents a preview of what to happen next in the other half, only stretched into two hours of tiring sameness and boring exchanges of bland dialogues. The new characters are interesting yeah, but I'm not sure if anyone of them has offered something more than Lawrence, to spark further interest. Well, at least we can take comfort from the fact that the last movie next year will certainly offer a lot more, gripping action and drama, and that's really something to look forward to. Mockingjay Pt.1 falls below the heights reached by the previous two films. Minus Lawrence, this film is a real bore, and its hard to seek something more than her to recommend. I give this film 6 of my 10 stars."
