         "Snow White, in the first line, is a love story: Paco, the lead singer of a rap group from the french part of Switzerland, son of Spanish emigrants, occasionally falls in love to Nico, spoiled daughter of a swiss banker. But lots of things stand in between this predestined couple... of course the story plot line refers to the famous fairy tale \"Snow White\". But the movie is far away from being just a simple fairy tale: The question the author emerges with his film is: What do you do when you finish school if you got all the possibilities in the world?! the answer is frightening: Nico does not know what to do with her life and gets more and more in the swamp of endless partys, drugs and prostitution. What makes the movie interesting is, that it deals with different important aspects of contemporary swiss society like self-identity problems of young people (switzerland has one of the highest suicide rates), drug problems, the exchange between french and German speaking part, the immigrants etc. without rising the moral forefinger and combined with a entertaining and touching love story... Formally interesting about the film is its technique of editing. Samir uses - as in the preceding movies - different methods of montage, especially very carefully composed sequences with split screens... The reception of the movie in Switzerland has overall been very positive. Some bad reactions had to with the expectations: Samirs most known films have been highly intellectual documentary films about swiss and Iraqi society and culture. So for a part of \"his audience\" it was difficult to accept that he made an entertaining fiction film for a bigger audience... My main critique about this overall great movie is about the (too simply drawn) profile of some of the minor important characters like the parents of Nico. Last thing to mention is the great soundtrack including severals songs composed by the brilliant main actor Carlos Leal and interpreted by him and some of the members of his former music group \"Sens Unik\".",
         "Snow White, which just came out in Locarno, where I had the chance to see it, of course refers to the world famous fairy tale. And it also refers to coke. In the end, real snow of the Swiss Alps plays its part as well. Thus all three aspects of the title are addressed in this film. There is a lot of dope on scene, and there is also a pale, dark haired girl - with a prince who has to go through all kind of trouble to come to her rescue. But: It's not a fairy tale. It's supposed to be a realistic drama located in Zurich, Switzerland (according to the Tagline). Technically the movie is close to perfect. Unfortunately a weak plot, foreseeable dialogs, a mostly unreal scenery and the mixed acting don't add up to create authenticity. Thus as a spectator I remained untouched. And then there were the clichés, which drove me crazy one by one: Snow White is a rich and spoiled upper class daughter - of course her parents are divorced and she never got enough love from them, because they were so busy all the time. Her best girlfriend, on the other hand, has loving and caring parents. They (a steelworker and a housewife) live in a tiny flat, poor and happy - and ignorant of the desperate situation their daughter is in. The good guy (= prince) is a musician (!) from the French speaking part of Switzerland (which is considered to be the economically less successful but emotionally fitter fraction of the country). He has problems with his parents. They are migrants from Spain, who don't seem to accept his wild way of living - until the father becomes seriously ill and confesses his great admiration for his son from a hospital bed. And so it goes on: Naturally, the drug dealer is brutal, the bankers are heartless, the club owner is a playboy and the photographer, although a woman (!), has only her career in mind when she exposes Snow White in artsy pornographic pictures at a show. This review doesn't need a spoiler in order to let you add these pieces to an obvious plot. As I like other films by Samir, e.g. \"Forget Baghdad\", I was quite disappointed. Let's hope for the next one.",
         "I saw this piece in Dark Nights Film Festival almost by accident but I'm true to my feelings when I say I'm so very glad that I did. The piece itself has it all what I would look for in a movie - catching photography that makes you forget everything else and really connect to the movie, great ((acting)) by which I mean the storyline being so somehow close to the heart that it doesn't even feel like the characters are acting out parts, amazingly soulful touch of music background all through. I would advise anyone who have ever had a deep emotional bonding in a relationship to go see this one. I felt for the main characters all the way through and the story reminded me of the beauty of having and losing in a relationship. This movie has incredible warmth to bond with and at the same time it has the sweetly cold takes that show you the beauty of loss and losing control. My words can't do justice for this one - You just have to see it for yourself.",
         "Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too exaggerated. Anyway, the movie seems not to have a lot of artistic ambitions. Instead, I think this is a straight commercial thing. Including a character from the french part of Switzerland (the actor IS the leader of the band he is touring with in the movie - the band's called SENS UNIK) seems to aim to a larger audience. A straight German-swiss movie would not have sold in the french part - and vice versa. What really got on my nerves were the product placements all over the movie. Sometines scenes remembered of advertisement clips! I also think the topic of \"young people taking drugs without any other targets in their lives\" is a wide spread reality in Zurich. Therefore, it should be elaborated with more care. I hope Samir got enough money with Snow White, in order that his next movie is gonna show his true artistic skills.",
         "Nico (Julie Fournier) is a spoiled-but-troubled brat, and Swiss indie musician Paco (Carlos Leal) is her one chance to escape the world of wealthy weasels she has grown up in. Now this girl, why haven't I seen her before? Why isn't she on the covers of magazines? Maybe she is, but only in Switzerland? Either way, Julie Fournier is the most beautiful young actress I have seen in a long time, and, believe me, check out rising female stars is pretty much all I do. A good-looking girl makes for a good-looking movie: swimsuits, parties, dancing, all with a somewhat 1980s feel, down to the visual gadgetry: split screen, patchwork interlace, spaghetti preparation time-lapsed into a three-second sequence. The same goes for subject matter. It's all there, the coke and the rap and the booze and the pain. What you see is what you get, and it's watchable enough as it is, although there is probably a more substantial movie here, struggling to get out. Go see it if you liked \"Tempo\" (1996/II). Typical line: \"I'm too cranked up on coke to get laid. Let's smoke some pot first.\"",
         "\"Snow White\" is a Swiss/Austrian co-production that resulted in a 2005 film written and directed by a filmmaker who goes by the alias of Samir and is apparently somewhat known in Switzerland. There are also some French-language parts in here, but most of the film is in German or Swiss German. This movie had its 10th anniversary last year and runs for almost two hours. The lead actress is the absolutely stunning Julie Fournier as you can see from the title photo here on IMDb. She plays a character who struggles a lot in life due to difficulties in finding out what she wants, in terms of private and professional life, and most of all because of permanent drug abuse. Sadly, her friends aren't exactly a help as they keep doing drugs all the time with her. But then, strangely enough, a man appears and he is a rock musician who, because of experiences in his family, is strictly against drugs now, despite his profession and he may be the light at the end of the tunnel for our Snow White here. He is played by Carlos Leal and Leal achieved a decent deal of awards recognition for his performance here. I think he was pretty good, but so was Fournier. I personally think she is more than just a pretty face. Kinda sucks to see her career has not really been that great in the least decade. But back to this film here. The reason why I still give this one not that many stars is because I was not impressed with any of the supporting performances. If you do without some of the less influential characters, you easily could have kept this film at 95-100 minutes and it would have been an even more essential and more focused outcome. Admittedly, there are sequences in here when the film drags and honestly two decent lead performances alone are not enough to let me recommend the watch here, if everything else is mediocre or even weak. Admittedly without Fournier or Leal playing the core characters, it would have been way worse. No idea why the actress who played Snow White's best friend (and who was very generic and forgettable) got some awards recognition as well, but the lead actress doesn't. Oh well, cannot come up with an explanation for this. I myself think overall the weak outweighs the strong and there is more negative in this film than positive. As a consequence, i cannot recommend the watch here, even if I would have loved to."

         "Nico spends most of her time in the local club with her best friend Wanda (Zoé Miku). She is able to afford her extravagant life-style by maintaining an affair with the clubs' owner, Boris (Stefan Gubser). Wanda on the other hand couldn't be more different to Nico, stemming as she does, from a lower working class background. Wanda is determined to take advantage of her good looks to make as much money as possible. Nico is intelligent enough to see through her own superficial lifestyle, but too indecisive and unsure as to how to change it. One evening in Boris' club, she meets the front man of the Hip-Hop band «Menace Evasion». Paco (Carlos Leal) is critical towards his success, aware that his songs are being played in supermarkets but that no one cares to listen to his lyrics. Fascinated by Paco's provocative style Nico decides to confront him backstage and the two slowly fall in love with each other. Nico is impressed by Paco. A «rebel» who uses words like «message» without irony. She arduously tries to incorporate some of Paco's rebellious approach to life into her own world, with self-destructive consequences.",
         "20 year-old Nico (Julie Fournier) lives to party. She comes from an affluent neighbourhood on Zurich's Gold coast and since finishing high school she's been living life day by day and focussing, above all else, on herself. Her relationship towards her parents is practically non-existent. Her father strives to make a name for himself as a banker and is thus hardly ever at home. Her mother lives alone, unable to get to grips with her life.",
