         "this was an offbeat role for Steve Cochran who was typecast in Hollywood in tough guy, gangster roles. The rapport between the cowboy, the stallion and a young girl played by Sherry Jackson was gentle and realistic. Filmed in Warner color, on location in Wyoming, it rings true to life as the cowboy searches for and rescues a horse from a short, cruel life in a rodeo. There is humor and action, with an escaped circus lion, a brutal owner, as the cowboy bonds with the abused animal. A good film for adults and children and a plea for the protection of wild horses. (still in jeopardy today) And if you are a Steve Cochran fan, a rare treat. And the film scheduled to be shown on TCM in late January, if only this might result in a DVD release, we wouldd have a happy ending for sure:)",
         "This movie ranks among movies like Lassie, Smoky, National Velvet & The Black Stallion. This tear jerker story is about a man & his horse & the wonderful bond they had. Unfortunately it has never been released on video & I have not found it on TV, Cable or Satellite since I was a kid. At least not since the invention of VCR's. I have many fond memories of this film.",
         "Wild horse training cowboy Steve Cochran (as Ben Kirby) wants to keep a beautiful black stallion for himself, but the animal is sold to a rodeo showman. He finds \"Wildfire\" being abused by owner Ray Teal (as Dave Tracy), who won't sell. After leaving a refused $600 payment for the horse, Mr. Cochran sets him free. Later, Cochran trains Wildfire while working for Utah rancher Harry Antrim (as Cas Bagley) and bonding with his cute pigtailed granddaughter Sherry Jackson (as Jenny). The family-friendly trio is threatened by a nasty lion and the return of Wildfire's angry owner... There are some spotty production values, but \"The Lion and the Horse\" gives you a great look at Cochran in an appealing leading role. ****** The Lion and the Horse (5/17/52) Louis King ~ Steve Cochran, Sherry Jackson, Ray Teal, Harry Antrim",
         "I enjoyed the film until the final battle between the lion and the horse. (The horse is magnificent to watch through out the entire film.) In the battle, it is obviously a man in a lion skin that jumps on the back of the horse in an attempt to kill the horse. In the ensuing battle, it is clearly a lion skin draped around the horse. At least the director used shrubbery in an attempt to hide this charade but it simply ruins what had been a very enjoyable 82 minutes. The Utah scenery is magnificent. The child actor is very good as are the secondary and third level actors. Max Steiners music has its normal wonderful sound. If you can get passed the disappointing battle at the end of the movie, you will find it a good way to kill a quiet 90 minutes.",
         "This is a great and touching movie for all age groups that like horses or great westerns. This was made when there was great pride in picture taking without a lot of violence and bad language with a great story and a very happy ending.",
         "I must admit, I saw this film when I was around 10 or 11. I very much enjoyed it then. I grant you, it's a \"grade B\" western, but who cares. If you are a horse lover you will enjoy this movie. To this day I remember the song in the movie: \"They bury them deep in Kanab(sp).\""
