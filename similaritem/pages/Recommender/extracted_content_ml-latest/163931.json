         "content": "**Game, music, celebration, romance, emotion, family, friends and the war!**\r\n\r\nAfter giving the career best, the director Ang Lee returned with this which is quite a long gap for him between the films. He has fallen back to the average, like usual whenever he gives a masterpiece. Most directors do that. This film was adapted from the book of the same name. It was not a full fledged war film. It has soldiers, but one day event theme where they are on the short break to homeland to participate in the felicitation programme for their victory.\r\n\r\nThe story closely focused on the young soldier, Billy, Lynn. He was the centre of the event, a war hero. During his stay, he recalls the original event. What really happened and what else he could have done. Apart from that, enjoying the day with a game from the stadium, dance, musics and many more. Meeting family has a sub-plot that reveals about his choice to join the army. Overall, a memorable day with happy and sad incidents.\r\n\r\nSo my first thought in the initial stage was like it is another film similar to the 2009's 'The Messenger'. No, it was not. It was completely different than anything I've seen so far. Refreshing, but not captivating. If you are okay with simple, yet want a feel strong, this is it. It is kind of like mixed result film. Great casting and strong performances. Wonderful debute for the lead actor.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, mix of colourful, full of music, emotional, romantic, thrilling presentation. A bit Americanised, like the film events and the patriotism. So, a much better suitable film for the domestic audience than the rest of the world, perhaps excluding western world. Even though, watching it once is no harm or not bad.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",

      "synopsis": "October 23, 2004 Video footage is seen of two insurgents in Iraq carrying a wounded staff sergeant toward a foxhole. A soldier named Billy Lynn (Joe Alwyn) intervenes and shoots the insurgents to run to the sergeant while fending off other shooters. The footage of the heroic act circulates throughout the media, and Billy becomes a national hero. Thanksgiving Day, 2004 Billy wakes up and goes to join his Bravo Squad - Sgt. David Dime (Garrett Hedlund), Mango (Arturo Castro), Foo (Mason Lee), Crack (Beau Knapp), Lodis (Brian \"Astro\" Bradley), Holliday (Ismael Cruz Cordova), and Skyes (Barney Harris). The squad has been going through a promotional tour with their producer Albert Brown (Chris Tucker). A rep from the Dallas Cowboys named Josh (Ben Platt) goes to pick up the team in a limo. Two days earlier, the squad was holding a funeral for their fallen sergeant Virgil \"Shroom\" Breem (Vin Diesel), whom Billy was trying to save in the video. After the funeral, Billy returned home to his mother (Deirdre Lovejoy) and sisters Kathryn (Kristen Stewart) and Patty (Laura Lundy Wheale). In the limo, Albert tells the squad that he is in the process of negotiating a deal to make a movie based on their heroics, joking that Hilary Swank wants to play Billy. During his training on tour, Dime and Shroom were aware that Billy had a criminal record before he was stationed out to Iraq. Billy explains that Kathryn was in a car accident that left her with multiple stitches on her face and lower body, leaving her with scars in the present. Her fiance dumped her in the hospital, prompting Billy to destroy the man's car and chase him with a tire iron. He signed up the next day so that the charges would get dropped. One of the Bravos' missions involved them raiding a compound to take down possible insurgents. They take down two men in front of their wives and children. Billy recalls the face of one of the children staring daggers at him for taking his father. The squad arrives at the football stadium for their show. A number of excited and anxious fans talk to them to express gratitude for their work or to share hateful comments about those that the team is fighting. They sit for a press conference, where Billy spots one of the cheerleaders, Faison (Makenzie Leigh) smiling at him. After the conference, Faison walks over to Billy and starts up a conversation with him. He tells her how it feels weird to be honored for the worst day of his life. She offers some optimistic insight before they go off and have sex. Billy and Mango go off with a stadium employee that shares a joint with them. The three of them talk about having nothing to look forward to when everything is over. We see a flashback of Billy sitting under a tree and talking with Shroom, who always spread nothing but wisdom and love to his teammates. Another flashback shows Billy sitting to have dinner with his family upon his return home. They left the news on, which is focusing on war-related topics. The family starts to have an argument that ends with Mrs. Lynn slamming the table, giving Billy a bit of a scare. The squad sits to watch the game right before they are set to get up for their appearance during the halftime show with Destiny's Child. It's also mentioned that the squad is set to return to Iraq shortly after their promotional tour is over. Billy gets a phone call from a doctor that Kathryn spoke to in regards to trying to have him honorably discharged so that he doesn't have to go back to Iraq so that he won't have to suffer any longer. The squad changes into their camouflage outfits for the halftime show. The lights, exploding sounds, and overall hectic atmosphere causes distress to some of the guys, particularly Crack, who pushes one of the producers and has to be calmed down by the other guys. Destiny's Child performs their songs, and Billy walks down the middle during the song \"Soldier\". After the show, the guys get into it with the stage manager who acts like a dick to them for still being on the stage before the game is about to start up again. They head on to continue watching the game. One guy watching the game makes a comment to the guys about their opinions on gays in the military. Crack replies by putting the guy in a sleeper hold until he passes out. We go back to October 23rd and see the event in full. Shroom went out to take on the insurgents and was shot badly. Billy ran in to save him, shooting the insurgents that came near him. Another one shot at him from behind a truck, only to get shot to pieces. Billy took Shroom into the foxhole, but another insurgent came toward Billy. Shroom grabbed the man's gun and gave Billy an opportunity to attack. After a brief struggle, Billy stabbed the insurgent in the neck until he bled out. Billy went over to Shroom, but he was already gone. Dime ran in and cried with Billy, telling him how proud he was of his actions. Billy and Dime later meet with Norm Oglesby (Steve Martin), the owner of the Cowboys who is also investing in the movie project about the squad. However, instead of the previous offer of $100,000 to each member of the squad for the movie, Oglesby has reduced it to $5,500 apiece, which infuriates the squad. Dime angrily rebuffs his offer. When Oglesby talks to Billy in private, he tells Billy that this story is no longer his, but it's now America's story. Billy also shoots down Oglesby's offer and joins Dime in refusing to do business with him. As the squad leaves, they get attacked by the stage manager and his goons. This gives Billy a full wave of PTSD imagery. The stage manager and his goons get arrested later. The squad is preparing to make their return. Billy meets up with Faison briefly before leaving. He says he wishes he could run away with her even though he has to go back. They share a kiss before parting ways. Not long after, Kathryn goes to pick Billy up, but with merely an expression, he makes it clear he can't stay. She is upset, but he goes over to talk to her. They share a tearful hug. Billy goes to the limo, which he sees as a humvee. He enters and imagines Shroom talking to him one more time. In reality, he is with the squad. They all tell Billy they love him right before they leave.",

         "Many people said it is an anti-war movie,I don't think so. This movie is far more than anti-war.Because it is not a rich story ,but a rich truth and an emotion. It doesn't want to give you an opinion about what war is, but show you an emotion about a young man and a war. A so-called hero came back from Iraq, how is his life? In the real world, the truth and emotion are complicated. So it is hard to say what its theme is. Maybe the theme is to doubt our fake society Maybe the theme is to show the hero's confused life. However, they are parts of this movie. It is more like a section of Billy's life. He has family,battle companion, stranger and girlfriends. Sometimes he is distracted at his important moment,sometims all in front of him remind him of war. He sees and thinks.He might find that life is difficult to choose,finally he go back to the place where he belongs. If you can feel you are Billy Lynn, you can feel how ridiculous this society is.Nobody understands you,people see what they want to see.the sad thing is, you can change nothing but follow the direction of fate. If you don't have sensory substitution,this movie is boring. From the beginning of Billy's halftime showï¼ I can't help crying. I even can't detail the reasons of my tears. The emotion is so strong, so complicate and so advanced. I feel so sad about Billy's life. I think it is a good movie, not very fun, but revolutionary.",
         "This will be short and to the point. Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is not a \"war movie\". It is not a propaganda picture about American Imperialism, it is not a recruitment poster, and it is most certainly not an action movie. War, in all its complexity, is incidental to this film. Billy Lynn just happens to be a soldier and the events that kick off the film happened at war. This is a film about labels. From the moment Billy is labeled a \"hero\" by the press for doing something he didn't have time to think about, his life is consumed. He comes a symbol to everyone he meets, even those who are supposed to love and know him best. To the Army, he becomes a recruitment tool. They send him on tour to be the Face of the War despite accomplishing nothing more than anyone else in his unit. To Hollywood, he becomes a character. A fiction to be utilized in winning more accolades for people who already have plenty of it. To his admirers, he becomes a \"hero\". A walking uniform onto whom one can pin all their unfulfilled aspirations and unrealistic expectations. One whose hand they can shake and be freed of all responsibility. To his sister, he becomes a victim. An unwilling pawn of an unjust war, no matter how he himself feels about it. To everyone, Billy Lynn becomes everything except Billy Lynn. The flesh and blood and memories of the person disappears into the mystique of heroism, until the only people left who still see it are his fellow soldiers. And the only place left where he isn't a symbol, the war. This is not a war movie. If that is what you are expecting, don't see it.",
         "I just watched this film as part of the New York Film Festival early screening and it's a film that will be stuck in my mind for awhile, it's a deeply emotional and moving film with great acting (particularly newcomer, Joe Alwyn), cinematography and an original score. The ending was strong and had me choked up, the movie is based on a satirical novel so there is definitely some humor in it so it's not a totally depressing film but definitely a thought-provoking one, this was the film I was anticipating the most out of the 2016 releases then upon reading some underwhelming reviews from the opening night my expectations went down a little but I think it will be go down as one of the best films of the year, it's images and its anti-war message in my opinion were powerful and the film should inspire a lot conversation about what it means to \"support the troops\" and how we can help those returning who are suffering from PTSD, overall I give it 8 out of 10 stars, I hope people go out and see this in the theater and talk about it afterwards.",
         "This is a very effective anti war movie. And it achieves a lot with a pretty low body count. It looks at a young soldier who after performing a heroic action caught on camera is involved in a promotional tour. It's subtle but completely clear in it's message. Through flashbacks there are many effective contrasts here between what went on in Iraq in attacks and the public relations football match slash Destiny's Child concert. Also showing the troops rounding up men in their home with their families watching. It is very insightful how he was about to give up the soldier life for this cheerleader he hooked up with only to find she only was interested in him as a hero. Another great realism shown is how the slimy developer magnate played by Steve Martin wants to short change them for rights to a film about the soldiers. Liked how they are so unappreciated by the guys back home who try to pick fights with them The most touching parts are with his sister played by Kristen Stewart who is the only one who really cares for him and tries to do something about it. There is no sentimentality wasted in the movie so their final scene is more meaningful for that. Kristen acts convincingly as the injured sister. Subtle and thoroughly convincing. Joe Alwyn as the title character is a good choice. He isn't too good looking so it's realistic. And he doesn't overact either. Just the right amount of emotion. This movie makes one think about it after it's over. Best Ang Lee movie for a while.",
         "-Warning! Spoilers! Do NOT read this until AFTER you have watched the film.- Around 1:35 in the film, when Albert (Chris Tucker) is in the bathroom talking to Lynn about what \"they call in my business, a Hollywood Moment.\" As he is reassuring him, he says that he will, \"Go all the way to China to get this film made if he has to.\" So meta. So awesome. Even the cinematography there, with the pep talk to Lynn \"..more Americans need to see the war like you guys do..\" was straight out of a prior generation American propaganda flick. Vocal tone. Framing. Ang Lee and the rest of the team did an amazing job with this. If any hour's plus worth of film can communicate so, so many of the true dynamics involved in the \"War on Terror\", this is the film to do it. This film should be mandatory viewing for all middle school or high school students. The characters and dialogue are so over the top sarcastic and poignant, that I truly believe all but the most dense and indoctrinated Americans will be forced to think and question by this film. The moment where the union thugs, whose conflict started over their slighted authority to clear the stage previously, ambush the shoulders, really drives how upside down our society has become with regards to where the reins of power are. They are there in hands those who put on the show to support the empire. Not those whose story is propagandized to in the first place. Military or Minimum Wage Service, which one will it be? Too many Americans are forced with that brutal choice for survival. This film does an amazing job of touching upon the absurdity between 'rich' and 'poor'. Above and beyond everything this film did well, the dialogue and casting for Garrett Hedlund as the SSGT leader of Bravo was beyond stellar. He perfectly projected that manipulative technique, that the military uses as a lever to keep some of the most good intentioned troops engaged in combat. \"No matter how screwed up the mission. No matter how dire the circumstances. It is all about the man to your left, and to your right. They are there for you, and you are there for them.\" Or as it was written in the film. (paraphrased) \"I need you Billy. I need you to help me keep these guys alive.\" It was the moment that Lynn decided to stay with the guys. It is a moment that anyone who has ever made a commitment to someone else, and had that commitment tested in a manner that few ever will, can perfectly understand. I hope that people, after watching this film, take a real hard look at what is going on behind the reasons they are given. That they look at the reasons television, and the Internet give them for supporting a government, that sends good men, to do violence in some of the poorest places on earth, for the benefit of fewer than 1% of the world's population. Not just less than 1% of America's population, but of the world's population. \"It would take a real hero to stand up to our country.\" as Kathryn (Kristen Stewart) says at the end. But first, heroes would have to unplug from the narrative.",
         "Ben Johnson's novel has been exceptionally well adapted for the screen by Jean- Christophe Castelli and directed with the expected sensitivity of Ang Lee. It is a kick in the gut for those who see it \u2013 an anti-war statement placed in front of us as the never- ending wars in the Middle East continue to fester and destroy lives on all sides of the war zone and beyond. But it is also a biting statement about the time in which we live, a time when entertainment and gross spending of money is directed toward the insatiable appetite for big shows and stars and shallow moments of pleasure that appear to obsess us. The manner in which returning soldiers face 'instant glory' is overshadowed by the inherent bully-ism by a public that does not understand the cancer of war and how it metastasizes throughout our troubled planet. The film is told from the point of view of 19-year-old private Billy Lynn (Joe Alwyn) who, along with his fellow soldiers in Bravo Squad (Garrett Hedlund, Arturo Castro, Mason Lee, Astro, Beau Knapp, Ismael Cruz Cordova, Barney Harris and Vin Diesel) becomes a hero after a harrowing Iraq battle and is brought home temporarily for a victory tour. Through flashbacks, culminating at the spectacular halftime show of the Thanksgiving Day football game in Dallas, Texas, the film reveals what really happened to the squad - contrasting the realities of the war with America's perceptions. Billy's family's response to his Silver Star heroism is conflicted with Billy's damaged sister Kathryn (Kristen Stewart) who pleads with Billy not to return for another tour in Iraq. Billy finds a possible entry to fame through a film about Bravo by Albert (Chris Tucker), thwarted by the wealthy insensitive would-be backer Norm (Steve Martin), an introduction to love by one of the Dallas cheerleaders Faison (Makenzie Leigh), and in the end, though disenchanted with America's reaction to what soldiers suffer in war zones, Billy makes the 'long halftime walk' back to his beloved buddies of Bravo as they prepare to return to duty. The film seems all glitter on the surface until the inserted flashbacks of the realities of war in Iraq \u2013 a factor that makes the film even more poignant as an anti-war statement. This is a strong film that will move sensitive viewers \u2013 hopefully to action.",
         "Director Ang Lee has a knack for packing a serious, emotional punch in even the most quiet moments of a movie; and he does that again with \"Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk,\" a mostly quiet movie that contemplates the craziness of war: started by the rich; fought by the poor and young; the physical and emotional damage it does to the soldiers and their families; the lies that are told to keep the war effort going; the lip service that most civilians give to the soldiers as life goes on as if there is no war happening, etc. After his heroic actions during the second Iraqi war are captured on video for all of America to see, Joe Alwyn (who plays the title role) and his infantry squad are paraded throughout the U.S. to be used as living propaganda for America's war against Iraq. On the last day of their \"vacation\" in the U.S. before being shipped back to the war, Alwyn's experiences in Iraq and his first days of coming home are told in flashbacks. He clearly suffers from post traumatic stress disorder, and he finds a way out of going back into combat duty thanks to his loving and tenacious sister played by Kristen Stewart. But he must make a tough decision whether to take care of himself and take the way out, or take care of his squadmates and go back into combat with them. My most memorable, movie moment of \"Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk\" is the scene when a civilian starts making fun of soldiers during a football game. One of Alwyn's squadmates puts the loudmouth in a sleeper hold, silencing his big mouth in seconds. Ang Lee does a great job with \"BLLHW,\" focusing on Alwyn and allowing the audience to see what this soldier has seen and what he is thinking. I especially enjoyed the unpredictable nature of this movie, as it could have gone in so many clichÃ©d routes in the third act under the guidance of untalented directors/producers/writers; but the filmmakers chose to take the road less travelled, and produced a relatively quiet ending that is still emotionally powerful. Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",
         "These young men come home to be celebrated, but instead find themselves dropped headfirst into America's worst examples of decadence and greed. It is the most accurate representation I've seen yet, of the cancer eating away at our great country. Bravo to Mr. Lee! I have to admit I wasn't expecting a great deal out of this movie's director, what with the failure of 'Hulk', but I walked away from it with a new depth of understanding. It was an astoundingly well portrayed film. I gave the movie 9 out of 10 because of Vin Diesel's lack-luster performance. Else, the movie was excellent!",
         "Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is a war drama that could have been so much more as a movie. It tries to be an emotional moving picture about a young army specialist Billy (Joe Alwyn) after a battle in Iraq that left him emotionally scarred from losing one of his own and from taking a life. Being home, he is conflicted with the images of war that is preventing him on trying to live a normal life. His sister Kathryn (Kristen Stewart) is trying to convince him to stay or see a doctor that can diagnose him for the trauma. While, his Sgt Dime (Garrett Hedlund) is trying to get them prepped to going back to Iraq after their thanksgiving football tour with a halftime walk during the Destiny Child's concert. The pro about the film, I am surprised to see Joe Alwyn delivering a semi decent performance as Billy Lynn. The way his character is trying to have a good time with his squad during the football event. But at the same time, he is struggling within. Even from his facial expressions, knowing that he is not entirely in peace. Being a first time on screen with this actor, I will say he did well for his first role on film. The con about the movie, I am disappointed with this film overall. Especially, being an Ang Lee film, I was expecting a little bit more from his direction. He tended to focus on delivering an impressive quality on the technical part of his filmmaking by shooting in 4k. With this film and setting, I felt like this was not as noticeable or worth talking about except it being clear and making these characters feel like a cut out cardboard. The narrative structure of the film was all over the place and the pacing was incoherent. Which made it difficult to have emotions for these characters, even though it was suppose to have those feelings. Made the movie overall very boring. Lets talk about the dull subplots, with movie studio producer Albert (Chris Tucker) trying to get the rights from Billy and his squad to make a movie about them and their bravery mission. I also thought the action sequence with Billy and his squad fighting in a battle had some terrible editing and direction. Billy Lynn is a war drama film that shows the struggles with PTSD and going back to war but Ang Lee's direction was so dull and disappointing. The film is very forgettable. Sad to say, because Joe Alwyn and the rest of the cast are talented but the script was all over the place with the halftime show, Billy's visit with the family, and his time in Iraq. I would not recommend it.",
         "This movie is far from anti-war. This movie is full of emotion and thinking of soldier after-war life. They are not understood and being treated with people's arrogance and coldness. People do not really care about them but what can they dig from them. The director again use his way to express the emotion inside the character which he is most good at. the movie is worth seeing and currently is under rated. Besides the clips of the movie is excellent. It is harding to contiune switching between two time and spacing and not make audience feeling wired and confused. But in this movie you can feel that it is natural and your mind will completely goes with Billy. You will feel what he feels and see what he sees. Again Ang Lee made it.",
         "I don't know what to say bout this movie. It is a story which I agree totally with, in his message. It is outrageous how the war vets are treated when they come back. If they are not ignored, ostracized or insulted - see for instance the Nam vets - they are used as tools, puppets to make money, used by sharks who intend to make big, big money at their own advantage over the poor soldiers. I agree with the message of this film which denounces this. But it is too big, it is caricature to me, too easy...See for instance Steve Martin, the ruthless and disgusting business man who uses the vets. The way Ang Lee has to show him - don't miss the takes on his eyes, shark eyes - made me sick, if I had a gun, I would have shot at the screen to kill him. I would say that is a didactic purpose. No nuance here, good guys again bad ones, and this is a shame. Sidney Lumet would have given something different from such a topic, no doubt about this.",
         "Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk gives us the workings of cinema master Ang Lee in this boisterous, ballsy film that wishes it was better than what it is. The film tells the story of a hero solider who returns home to be on display at a Super Bowl Halftime show, as he is about to make his long walk, he is plagued with bouts of PTSD that force him to recount exactly what happened to him. The film's concept is great, there's no denying that. This could have easily been a straight forward drama without all the technicalities that Ang Lee put into it. Yes, 120fps makes it VERY easy to look at but outside of that, the substance to make have some sustainability is just not there. The film takes us on the journey of Billy Lynn from home, from the battlefield, from the halftime show. While we always know where Billy Lynn is coming from, we don't know where he is going. Lee creates a beautiful image but lacks developing any sort of meaningful relationship with Billy Lynn. Despite a strong performance from newcomer Joe Alwyn along with the rest of the cast, there's nothing really substantial here. The supporting cast featuring Garrett Hedlund, Kristin Stewart and Vin Diesel are all stellar in their own rights but without a well told story backing them up, their efforts feel useless. Overall, Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is beautiful to look at and definitely keeps in line with Ang Lee's Life of Pi more so than with any of his other films but what Life of Pi had in the way of story, this film lacks every step of the way. We know we're supposed to care about these characters, we are just not given a good enough reason to. If you're a fan of Ang Lee or cutting edge cinematography, definitely give this a watch. Outside of those two qualities, it's a film that is hard to recommend.",
         "Two Time Academy-Award Winner for Best Director, Ang Lee is back with 'Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk'. And heartbreakingly, this is the weakest film by the prolific director to date. Despite sincere efforts, this War-Drama is a misfire! 'Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk' Synopsis: 19-year-old Billy Lynn is brought home for a victory tour after a harrowing Iraq battle. Through flashbacks the film shows what really happened to his squad - contrasting the realities of war with America's perceptions. The biggest problem with 'Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk' is its unappealing Writing. Jean-Christophe Castelli's Screenplay, which is based on the novel by the same name by Ben Fountain, trembles. Billy Lynn's struggle in the war zone & the after effects once he returns home, are barely engaging. The Writing doesn't hold you or move, unfortunately! Ang Lee isn't in form this time around. His Direction leaves a lot to be desired. Cinematography & Editing are fine. Art & Costume Design are classy. Performance-Wise: Joe Alwyn as Billy Lynn, is the sole saving grace. He delivers an excellent performance from start to end. He has the potential to go places, given the right scripts. Kristen Stewart as Billy's older sister, tries to make the most out of her limited role. Chris Tucker is okay, while Steve Martin is wasted. And Vin Diesel is as usual. On the whole, 'Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk' is a poor show.",
         "War movies are often based on a true story. Not so with \"Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk\" (R, 1:50). Although there have been countless untold acts of heroism by American soldiers on the field of battle throughout history, this film isn't based on any of them. That, of course, would be perfectly fine \u2013 IF the scenarios on which its story were built bore any relationship to reality. This movie, based on the 2012 novel of the same name by Ben Fountain, is sometimes described as satire. If that were accurate, it would explain some of the story's many inaccuracies. However, satire is supposed to be funny and/or provide some meaningful social commentary, neither of which are true here. Nope. Instead what two-time Oscar-winning director Ang Lee (!) and his screenwriter, Jean-Christophe Castelli give us is the most clichÃ©d, unrealistic, uninspiring, pointless and offensive war film since the later \"Rambo\" movies. Billy Lynn (newcomer Joe Alwyn) is a 19-year-old trouble-maker who enlisted in the Army under the good ol' \"go to war or go to jail\" option. As an infantryman in Iraq, he's a member of Bravo Squad and finds himself under the leadership of Sgt. Dime (Garrett Hedlund) and Staff Sgt. Shroom (Vin Diesel). During a 2004 firefight in which Bravo was trying to prevent some civilian journalists from being taken hostage by the enemy, Spec. Lynn commits an act of bravery that is captured by a news crew's video camera. Billy receives the Silver Star and Bravo Company is temporarily brought home from Iraq for a cross-country tour designed to build support for the war. They're being accompanied by a Hollywood producer (Chris Tucker), who is trying to put together a movie deal for them, which may be financed by a certain NFL team owner, played by Steve Martin. Bravo's tour culminates in an appearance during the halftime show of a Thanksgiving Day NFL game in Dallas, Texas, after which they are to return to Iraq. Billy is conflicted. He had thought of himself as a poor excuse for a soldier, but ended up exhibiting extraordinary bravery. He finds it odd that he is being honored for what he calls the worst day of his life. Billy isn't much of a ladies' man and isn't very religious, but suddenly finds himself being hit on by an NFL cheerleader (Makenzie Lee) who talks a lot about her faith. Most of Billy's family is very proud of his service and his heroism, but his sister / best friend, Kathryn (Kristen Stewart), is against the war, and especially, her brother's continued participation in it. He's exhibiting signs of PTSD and she implores him to refuse to return to Iraq with his unit. She has a doctor from the VA call Billy at the stadium during the first half of that Thanksgiving Day football game to ask him to come in for treatment immediately after the game. Kathryn even plans to pick Billy up from the stadium and take him straight to the doctor. Many military veterans reading this review (as well as plenty of civilians with common sense) have probably already spotted serious problems with the plausibility of this story, but let me help fill in the gaps. Besides the implausibility of these subplots happening ON Thanksgiving Day, even more bothersome is the way many of the characters are portrayed. Without getting into a lot of the details (some of which would qualify as spoilers), everyone who supports the Iraq War is shown as a simpleton, civilians who don't seem to care either way are shown as brutes and the soldiers of Bravo are shown to be immature, undisciplined and extremely rude, especially for troops on a public relations tour. In fact, several things that happen in this movie would have landed people in jail, but are instead just glossed over as no big deal. This movie is likely to offend soldiers, their families, anyone who supports the troops, even people who oppose U.S. military action overseas and anyone who has ever worked in Hollywood, for an NFL team or in an NFL stadium. Furthermore, with few exceptions (such as Alwyn), the acting is shaky, the set pieces are unprofessional and the movie says nothing new or insightful about the American wars of the 21st century. If you'd like to see a recent war movie that IS realistic, inspiring, original, well-written, well-shot and well-acted, check out \"Hacksaw Ridge\". Best to let Billy Lynn take his \"Long Halftime Walk\" all by himself. \"D\"",
         "In terms of visuals Billy Lynn's was very impressive, however I would ask, is this the right genre of film to showcase such technical cinematography? Obviously such stunning shots could only be a plus to the film but for a film that is really more about one's internal struggles rather than exterior conflicts I do find it quite an odd decision to make this film in such a way. I did go in expecting an all out war movie since I have heard of all of these things that Ang Lee is doing in this film, in terms of visuals. Which did leave be surprised but also disappointed at how few those scenes are. Essentially this film takes place within a time span of one day and all takes place at this football game? What? Obviously there were flashback scenes and all but there were quite few and every time we jump back to the present time it just leaves be craving for the next flashback scene. I can understand this message that the film was trying to send about being considered a 'war hero', about all the costs and sacrifices that soldiers are making each day and the way they are treated. How decorated war heroes are just a sort of title, people will show you and tell you how much they appreciate your services and what not but when it comes to actually giving anything we never seem to be so eager to. It is a film that showcases this idea of being crowned a 'hero' and what it really means, and sure that was quite an interesting theme to look at. But perhaps to make this whole story more impactful instead of having flashbacks tell us the story overseas we get a whole first half of the film showing it to us, before all of the victory tour stuff. It just makes it very hard for audiences to understand the implications and the sacrifices that they have made if this sort of flashback storytelling is used. It is often hard to make a good war movie that isn't based on a true story, this is likely because when audiences know that it is fictitious the stakes wouldn't be so high, and it won't really touch people's hearts so to speak. So both these elements combine to create the war's lack of importance which is a very bad thing to have happen. In conclusion, I liked what they were trying to say, the underlying idea and theme of the film came indefinitely of a good place. However poor storytelling and lack of story in general really made this film suffer quite a bit.",
         "The moment the audience saw the first shot of Billy Lynn reaching for his phone, the audience gasped. Ang Lee's ambitious choice of filming at a frame rate of 120fps in a 4K and 3D format is beyond words. We become immersed into Billy Lynn's world, seeing the little details that we normally would not see in a film (imagine what Emmanuel Lubezki did in 'The Revenant' and times it by 5). The person I went with to see the film described it best, it was a very sensual experience not just from the cinematography, but also the interesting soundscape and phenomenal editing. There are small moments when what would be a mundane action becomes a trigger for Billy Lynn and his squad. Lee does not hold back in making the audience feel the PTSD of those soldiers which at times is beautiful done as well as a bit too much for those of us who have never experienced it. Now I could go on about how brilliant the film is technically and it's sure to get some Oscar recognition in that aspect, but all films revolve around a story. What could have been an amazing film merely becomes an OK film because of the story's weakness. I read an article where the critic trashed Ang Lee, but to be honest it's not Lee who's to blame but whoever wrote the script. The script is so dull and because of that the audience never got the full immersion we were hoping to get. The only person we connect to by the end of the film is Kristen Stewart's character, yet that isn't even delved into. The relationships between the characters aren't developed very much except for one relationship that is developed WAY too fast and in the most unrealistic way possible. You can get a sense of a strong bond between Lynn and his squad, but just barely. As for the acting, Kristen Stewart was definitely the standout. Joe Alwyn did a great job, too, but not the memorable debut performance I was hoping to see. Vin Diesel and Steve Martin are truly miscast (this may just be me being picky, but every time they came on screen I felt very uncomfortable). To sum this up, I'm giving this movie a 7 out of 10 because of the technical brilliance and the experience of watching a film in this frame rate, though be warned that the story is very weak. Some people are going to find the 120fps very strange, but for the cinephiles who have an open mind, you'll be blown away.",
         "This is a good movie. All the discussion about it surrounds the technology used in making it, and that's necessary, but it's not the whole story -- nor is it NOT the story as others would have you believe. The simple fact is that this is a well-acted and at times completely engrossing anti-war picture, one that is more often than not, yes, let down by some of the failings of trying to show off the tech. Some scenes come across as incredibly \"stage-y\" for lack of a better word, and the lighting can be overlit fluorescent too often (like a docudrama). However, that being said, I did have the pleasure of actually being able to see this on 3D bluray and I must say it's absolutely the most stunning 3D I think I've ever seen. There's an incredible amount of depth to so many scenes -- sometimes it's showy, but sometimes it's in service of the story like when Billy comes home and the entrance hallway seems to stretch on forever out in front of him, inviting him in to its embrace but also providing a dark trap. The essential conundrum, the doublethink, at the center of his inner workings.",
         "Not the absolute worst Iraq movie that I've ever seen, but close to it. It in NO WAY reflects reality and is a dig at the war and soldiers in general. If you were \"over there\" you'd probably chuckle at the stupid characterizations that most civilians imagine a tour of Iraq was like. Some vets might get mad, but just remember that it's Hollywood. My only complaint is that they use soldiers to protest the war, when in fact- most of us are proud of our service there. I did three tours of combat duty in Iraq (Ramadi, TQ, and Q-West) and none of them are anywhere near this movie's portrayal. If you want to hear about the REAL war, ask a vet- some of us wouldn't mind answering questions.",
         "Hands down one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. The acting was poor, the reality of the story was poor, the story line was poor. I went in hoping for a great story, and it was a really big let down. The stereotyping of America was also an embarrassment. It made us look like a bunch of idiots. I have seen some other movies by this director and I was really hoping for something good. The only good part about the movie was that it showed the part of being a soldier that isn't so glamorous, but the quality of the story was just not good at all. Save your time for another movie. It was so unrealistic. About 1/4 of the way through the movie I thought to myself if the world outside of America sees this movie, they will think we are a bunch of uneducated morons. I have never complained about a movie here, but this one was so bad that I had to and I have no idea how it received 7 stars. Again, save your time and go see something else.",
         "This is yet another tremendous work by Ang Lee. Movie showcases post- victory celebration of war heroes, opinions and responses of people in the nation, inability of people to perceive their sacrifice of personal life and struggle between life and death. The psychological state of nineteen year old young war hero is sketched very effectively. Innocence, teenage infatuation, parting, and vanity of war are well communicated through dialogues and expressions. Director has nicely showcased high end display technology used in current day's sports and media. Script juggles between war scenes and post war recognition as gone through sensitive minds of young soldier. Movie has acknowledged rule of detachment from Hindu epic philosophy of Bhagavad-Gita. Also I am glad to see Lord Ganesha worshiped by a crew member.",
         "First of this is not an action movie. I don't know who the target audience this film was aiming for, males, females, age but they failed miserably on all accounts. This a movie about a soldier coming home and dealing with family, society, etc. while recalling past events. The problem is how poorly it is done. This movie is so bad it looks like it's supposed to be a parody of another movie. Some scenes are so bad i was unsure if they were suppose to be funny or serious. From the filming to the just how bad the dialogue is in this movie just seems so cheep. Majority of the movie consist of pointless conversations that having no relevance to anything. Chris Tucker is in the film but he is on the phone 95% of the time. I would highly recommend everyone missing this pooper. If you do watch this film, when they are marching at halftime look and how funny the guy on the far left is marching, it's comical. Also, I've never seen anyone, EVER, fall in love with each other in a span of one hour.",
         "Who is Billy Lynn and why do we care so much about his long half time walk? Billy Lynn (Joe Alwyn) is a young soldier in Iraq who was filmed performing an act of bravery when his platoon was under heavy fire. Billy is decorated for his act of heroism and his platoon is brought home from Iraq to travel the USA to garner support for the war. They have a publicist who is trying to get a movie deal about their heroics and an NFL team owner is interested in financing the movie. The soldiers are due to make an appearance during the halftime show of a Thanksgiving Day NFL game in Dallas where Destiny's Child are the headline act and then return to Iraq. It is clear Lynn is suffering with PTSD, his sister does not want him going back to fight and during this final appearance he gets friendly with a cheerleader. The film was a plodding boring dirge, a surprise given that it was directed by two time best director Oscar winner, Ang Lee. A lot of the story is told in flashbacks but it badly hampers the pacing of the film. It has an uneven rhythm. It is less of a war movie, not even an examination of soldiers feeling the trauma of war but a belated satire on the commercialization of war. Billy Lynn is no even that interesting, even his heroism is rather questionable, he just killed a man who went for him and you think is that all? At least he gets a bit of romance at the end but the film really has no focus. The post 2003 Iraq war films have underwhelmed. It really needs a story told by someone with purpose just as with the Vietnam war films where Oliver Stone, a combat veteran who served in Vietnam finally managed to tell a story with passion, depth that was both action packed but also had a personal journey. We are at the moment a long way off that.",
         "A very well done movie that does a great job putting the viewer into the battle zone, even if you have never been there. If you have been there, you'll find yourself at times on the edge of your seat, holding your breath, a good dose of realism, the type of movie I would not have been able to go to for a couple years myself. A little iffy on some of the casting, and got a little far fetched 3/4 of the way through the movie with some of the relationship issues, so I give it an 8 out of 10. Liberals from NYC won't get this movie, because they have never been there. They refuse to have empathy for those who put the uniform on and protect this country. Unless the movie puts service members in a bad light, those types will always give the movie a bad rating, which is sad. Many of these movies are well scripted, directed, with amazing settings and great acting. None of that matters to the anti-military types, they treat these reviews as an opportunity to put their political viewpoints out there, and ignore the story, or how it is presented. You see it time and time again on thousands of reviews on IMDb. It is almost as though those making the reviews use this as their platform, because bashing troops out in public while protesting is no longer \"fashionable\" like it was in the 1960's.",
         "The early low reviews did not hesitate me for Ang's new launch. Compare to my experience for \"Doctor Strange\", getting tickets were relatively easy even it is the 4k screen at AMC Lincoln Square. As Ang's style, the movie is full of details . You (or the screen) are often following Billy's flying thoughts, and they do not usually align with my sense from other movie experience. However Since Iraq and Cowboy's stadium are only two main scenarios, the jumping between two does not distract my continuously growing touching feelings from Billy Lynn. The 4k resolution definitely intense the connections. The climax of my feeling happens at Billy's fight with Iraqi, as he tried to save Sergeant Shroom, stabbed into his enemy and watching his eyes, I had the same feeling as Billy, \"I feel his soul rising\". Whether Billy's squad are in Iraq or at the AT&T Stadium, they are out of place. The Iraqi hate them, at home the young generation does not understand their devote to an unjust war, the rich and famous want to mock them and use them for their interest. The majority rest care more about the game. As Billy says \"We don't understand them and maybe they don't understand us as well.\" As the lone star flag streaming, the soldiers and the movie stand in the \"middle\" ground, derided by the lefts and not apprehended by the rights. Eventually, when the applause from the audience arose at the end of the movie, I am standing behind Billy Lynn at his mid time show.",
         "i know its cheesy , clichÃ© and one expects more from ang lee.....but wait guys...if we are so busy lauding other cheesy and clichÃ© films like Manchester by the sea..moonlight...la la land..lion and so on..then whats so wrong with this film...agree the new shooting technology makes this look more boring, cheesy and distracting ...infact acting and direction along with screenplay is so mediocre...but then there is a wonderful insight ...on the war and more than the war..on the consumerism and capitalism... now these are the issue which has driven humankind to disaster and earlier colonialism and world wars....so for me this film makes us do some soul searching and ask where the real enemy is ..and what is karma connection"

         "Two-time Academy AwardÂ® winner Ang Lee brings his extraordinary vision to Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk, based on the widely-acclaimed, bestselling novel. The film is told from the point of view of 19-year-old private Billy Lynn (newcomer Joe Alwyn) who, along with his fellow soldiers in Bravo Squad, becomes a hero after a harrowing Iraq battle and is brought home temporarily for a victory tour. Through flashbacks, culminating at the spectacular halftime show of the Thanksgiving Day football game, the film reveals what really happened to the squad - contrasting the realities of the war with America's perceptions. The film also stars Kristen Stewart, Chris Tucker, Garrett Hedlund, with Vin Diesel, and Steve Martin. Lee used new technology, shooting at an ultra-high frame rate for the first time in film history, to create an immersive digital experience helping him dramatize war in a way never seen before. Lee directed and produced the film, from a screenplay by Jean-Christophe Castelli and based on the novel by Ben Fountain. Marc Platt, Rhodri Thomas, and Stephen Cornwell are also producers.",
