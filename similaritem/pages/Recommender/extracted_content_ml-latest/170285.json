         "The first film was a disappointing and mediocre film, but actually was reasonably entertaining. There has been the general impression that the sequel is better than the first film, but I can't agree. Yes, I accept it was more faithful than the brilliant cartoon show, but I still think it was a very poor sequel. The script was very very weak, and even lower in laughs than the first film. I liked the idea of Dr Claw escaping from jail, but the pace of this film was way too fast, and lacked energy as well as felt rushed. And the editing was choppy, and the effects substandard. The performances were pretty dire. French Stewart proves once again, like he did in the excrement that is Home Alone 4, that he falls well short of the charisma and energy of his character and came across as rather wooden. I didn't like Tony Martin's Dr Claw either. I much preferred Rupert Everett's suave take on the classic villain, and Martin hamming-up came close to embarrassing rather than entertaining. In fact, the only redeeming quality, and this is a slight one, is the talented Caitlin Wachs, who deserved better. Overall, very poor, don't waste your time. 1/10 Bethany Cox",
         "Man, this movie was worse than the reviews (and the reviews were really bad). I thought that the first was bad enough, but when I saw this I was shocked. I can't even believe that someone could make a movie this bad, I mean I could probably make a better movie with a camera about shoelaces. This movie was a big waste of time and I sooooooo regret watching it. If only I could give it 0 out of 10. Good thing Matthew Broderick didn't sign up for this movie cause then he would be completely humiliated and considered a bad actor. The only reason I rented this movie was to see if it was worse than the first, which sucked. Anyways, I don't recommend this movie to anyone unless you're a 3 - year old idiot who eats his snot.",
         "Although IG2 is a bit sillier than the first movie, it's MUCH more faithful to the cartoon - once again Gadget says \"wowsers!\" (compared to \"wowser\" in the first one) and Dr. Claw (called both Claw and Dr. Claw) is faceless again. There is also no \"John Brown\" - it's just Inspector Gadget. Penny, although she has different hairstyles throughout the film, often wears her hair in her trademark pigtails of the cartoon. At first I thought that Elaine Hendrix would be awful as G2, but she proved me wrong. She played her part extremely well. Although French Stewart doesn't have the boyish charm of Matthew Broderick, he acts more like the Inspector Gadget of the cartoon. (And don't worry - he doesn't try to play Mr. Magoo!) This movie is also amazingly cartoon-like. The best way I can describe it is a \"live-action cartoon\". It's live action, but with all the silly stunts of an animated cartoon. (Such as a scene involving Gadget getting his head stuck in a toilet.) Although the CGI wasn't as good as it could have been, it wasn't too awful. If you're looking for a film that's true to the cartoon, IG2 is definitely worth seeing. Be warned, though, it's quite silly! :)",
         "if u look at this movie and you are a fan of the cartoon you will notice that this movie is very closer to the cartoon then the first one. that said it is just an avarage movie funny but too stupid and the lead actor French Stewart is bad but to be honest makes a better gadget them matthew broderick. claw is protrayed better by the director and writer.. for exsmple in the cartoon you never see claws face and he always escapes... all in all so bits of this movie should have been in the first one and if they had it would have turned the first one into a better movie... it is fun but dont watch it as a sequel watch it as another adventure.",
         "\"Inspector Gadget 2\" is possibly one of the worst sequels to dawn the direct-to-DVD call tag at the bottom of the box. Using nothings from the original film (not the same characters, not the same style, not the same comic timing), this film is one that you have to watch alone, not standing right next to the original Broderick vehicle. French Stewart (he is always squinting ... why?), with the aid of director Alex Zamm try to bring the original concept back the the series without any known budget. Stewart brings a new Inspector to the film, a more arrogant, snobbish, seems to be tormented by life, protagonist that cares nothing for those surrounding him. He is a character that we cannot love, no matter how many times we have to sit through one viewing of this film. What is interesting about Stewart is that he is actually closer to the the animated Gadget than the original. Zamm also tries to create a Dr. Claw that is closer to the original \u0096 but the trouble occurs with the fact that the two share very little screen time and thus there is no real chemistry between the two. Claw used to always monitor Gadget's doings, in this one, there seems to be a haphazard care as to what either is doing. Penny still doesn't have her book and Brain still isn't getting anyone out of trouble. Where is the consistency here? Too add to the mix, we are introduced to a new character \"G2\", the newest upgrade to the Gadget line. Like anything this riddled with clichés, there is an initial problem with the two of them, but eventually a spark misfires and Gadget is introduced to yet another love interest. Considering the problems anatomically with this couple, there is no further spark between them. The only reason the two are put in a this film are to be together, not for any other purpose. There is no sense of individualism, just flimsy cause followed by an effect that could have been predicted before the opening credits ended. \"Inspector Gadget 2\" has not seen the best reviews, nor will it get a good one from me \u0096 it tried, but ultimately it failed. There was no purpose to create this erroneous sequel. Disney was hoping to cash in on the Broderick fan base, the younger generation that knows no better , or just to make some extra dollars to pad their bottom line, but there was no reason to resurrect this already problematic series. I hated Elaine Hendrix's mesh between \"Robocop\" and \"Judge Dredd\". She was funny at parts that were not meant to be funny, and chokingly bad at parts that were meant to draw sympathy from the audience. Perhaps it was the writing, or the campy way that it was filmed, or the cheesy ploy to get audiences to laugh, but this sequel just left me out to dry. If I had to speak positively about this film in any way, I would have to comment on the CGI which did improve a bit with this lower-budget film. I thought the idea of \"freezing-time\" was a fun concept equal to what Claw would do, but again, we seemed to lack the spunk and originality of the cartoon. I would never consider this franchise a remake of the cartoon, but instead their own unoriginal spin-off. I blame Disney a bit for this film because cutting corners and cost is not an excuse for making poor films. If Broderick or even the horrid Everett could not reprise their roles for this sequel, it should have just stopped there. Don't push a circular peg into a square hole, but instead we continued to push and found cheap replacements for the original. This is a very kid friendly moment that if I were 3, would probably find visually entertaining, but from a company that prides itself on making Oscar-worthy animation, I expect a higher level of distribution. French Stewart should stop working while he still is remembered for his humorous work on \"Third Rock from the Sun\", while the rest of this cast shouldn't even bother with another feature. I think it is bad enough that they couldn't even get Cheri Oteri back, cause, you know, she's expensive. Overall, I have to say that \"Inspector Gadget 2\" is a blunderment of a film, and the one star review that I am giving it is generous. There is no need for these types of films to enter into mainstream cinema. It dulls the senses for those hoping to find engrossing cinema out there, and proves that a mind isn't necessary to watch French in action. As a cinematic community, we have to put a stop to this. Zamm attempted to retain some of the originality of the cartoon, but couldn't compile a cast good enough to bring the humor, form, grace, and talent of the animated series to light. There was no chemistry between anyone, and when the clichés began to cause a horrid avalanche, I was caught with nowhere to hide. If I had to end with a thought in mind, it would be this \u0096 Claw never showed his face, this can be learned from watching the pilot \"Inspector Gadget\" where he had a mustache, so you shouldn't be able to see his face in the films. It is simple. It would be like creating the Smurfs live-action where they were a shade of orange instead of blue. You just don't do it. So, when it comes to this film \u0096 just don't do it. You will be happier, and no so bitter like myself. Grade: * out of *****",
         "I really enjoyed watching this. There are 2 Inspector Gadget movies, the first one was made in 1999. This is the second one, but it doesn't continue from the 1st since it is a different director and it was released straight to DVD. This film is an alternative to the second film. If you didn't like the first film and wanted it to be more like the cartoons, then this one is for you. I liked both IG movies. This film introduces a new robot - IG2. The movie has an entire different cast, and Dr Claw's face is hardly ever seen like in the cartoons Nice special effects too, with a cartoon-like \"let's stop the bad guys\" ending. I find it funny and enjoyable.",
         "Wow. I had no idea a movie could be so awful. I mean I've seen the Ed Wood movie Plan 9 from Outer Space, but this was just one of those\"Are you F*%king kidding me\" movies. I mean why did they even bother making this if Matthew Broderick wouldn't come back. If Ferris Bueller won't do it, there's probably not to much promise in it. About the movie, why didn't any of the criminals just smash the G2 robot-thing, I mean how hard can it be to whack her in the head with a lead pipe and wrap her up with some chains then tear her apart with crow bars. Why did they need to replace Inspector Gadget anyway, oh yeah, so they could at least have something to make a sequel about. Bad story gone worse describes this whole thing.",
         "Okay, I'm gonna admit it right here and now. I liked the first IG. I know most people hate it, but I thought it was a very nice little movie. But THIS. This was just plain silly!! Nothing at all made any sense at all. Okay, now I thought in the first movie, John Brown/Inspector Gadget got a girlfriend, but WHERE IS SHE IN THIS MOVIE???!!! Second of all, how the heck could a human guy like IG fall in love with a robot??!!! What the heck where the writers thinking??!!!!! How could a human/robot breed with a robot?! ROBOTS HAVE NO REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS!!! The whole thing was totally whacked! And IG was just annoying in this movie!!! He was nothing but a smart-aleck know-it-all who was stupid and totally unfunny. Sheesh, what in the world happened to him after the first film?? And I hate what they did with Claw. How come in the first movie, he talked normal, but in this movie he has that wierd robot voice. Also, how come he turned into an old man? WHAT THE HECK WAS GOING ON HERE??!!!! Overall, this movie was just dead awful to me. It made no sense at all. This piece of crap gets a big fat, 1/10!!! Once again, I apologize to \"The Secret Of Nimh\". This movie, along with MST3K's \"Invasion Of The Neptune Men\" were worse.",
         "It was ok, I liked the 1st one better, I never like it when they go and change the characters, theres just something wrong with that...and some of the deleted scences on the DVD should have been in the movie, it would have made more sense to me, plus alot of those scences included penny which she was a main character solving the crime (like usual if you think back to the cartoon) but they hardly show her enough working with brain, just one scene. I rented it, but definatly not worth buying or copying/seeing at the theater...I just rented it.",
         "My family and I loved this film. It was funny, outrageous and much truer in spirit to the original cartoon series. We liked it a lot better than the first one and thought French Stewart sounded and acted a lot more like the cartoon Gadget. G2 was a nice addition and thought that the romance between she and Gadget had real spark. The special effects were great and the whole movie was a fun, wild ride that was really entertaining. Two thumbs up!",
         "I really enjoyed this movie. I believe it had great acting (French Stewart was remarkably funny) and was alot more faithful to the TV series than the original IG. The best changes are to Dr. Claw. Fans of the TV series will recognize the similarities (not seeing his face, the ugly cat). The wacky fun is back in this Inspector Gadget, and i recommend it to anyone looking for a good, funny movie for their family.",
         "This movie is heaps better than the first. For one thing they got the casting right in having French Stewart play Inspector Gadget. With his comedic background and animation he does a heaps better interpretation than Matthew Broderick. It was good too see that it was filmed in Brisbane too and fun trying to pick out all the locations and see some of the best Aussie actors on the cast. The DVD has a heap of extras on it and is informative. If you've got spare time one afternoon sit down and watch this for entertainment. I can't wait for the 3rd in 3D and hope that they do a better job of it than Spy Kids 3D",
         "I had high expectations when I heard about IG2, but I was not disappointed. Okay, maybe some things weren't from the original cartoon (the Gadgetmobile talks again, and Chief Quimby doesn't have a moustache), but the film did stay true to the original cartoon series (which is now on DVD in Australia), from the hiding of Claw to the classic slapstick humour. And of course, it was filmed in Australia! French Stewart (3rd Rock from the Sun) really brought Gadget to life, and Caitlin Wachs (Commander in Chief) was great as Penny. She was my favourite performance in the film. I thank Alex Zamm for creating a film that actually stays true to the cartoon, and a film that will keep me entertained when I watch it.",
         "This film is no masterpiece, but I didn't hate it either. In fact, many a time did I watch it when I was younger - and I honestly enjoyed it. It is a B-movie, with no cinema run, but is free from the clichés of the genre - no cheesy sound or visual effects, no rubbishy acting and no hideously contrived plot. I found this film hilariously funny - and it actually conveys a sense of mystery - what did happen to Claw's face? This film was obviously done on a high budget for a film of its calibre - none of the effects look hideously cheap. The time-stopping sequence may have been no Oscar contender, but it certainly was not the worst I've seen. The movie is very predictable, but all movies are these days - and Inspector Gadget 2 is about the gadgets and fun, and on that scale, it delivers. When Gadget cleaned the toilets and was thrown across the entire police station when his brush went erratic ranks amongst the funniest things I have ever seen - and that's up against some heavy competition. The film does contain some original ideas - to have a female Gadget who was a huge rival to Inspector Gadget was a very good idea, and the main premise for the movie. It is fun trying to watch Inspector Gadget win her heart, and though there aren't any Oscar-worthy performances to be seen, there is some character in this film, and it is hugely funny. Another cracking idea was to have Claw's new base at a bowling centre - makes a change from the multi-million dollar headquarters in the first one. And another great idea was to have Inspector Gadget as a bit of a bumbling imbecile instead of the hero in the first one - it worked well, and actually added to his charm. He also got sacked in this one - it happens halfway through or so, but it doesn't take a genius to know that he's going to rise again. Which he does. Though it is predictable and no masterpiece, Inspector Gadget 2 is an absolutely hilarious film and beats the first one hands down - it will have you in stitches. Good, but not quite spiffing - Inspector Gadget 2 is not a letdown, and certainly not a cheap, nasty looking one. (The gold deposit actually looked really convincing - but I'm sure they didn't have to spend $5,000,000,000,000 on it (as it said in the film) or even have to bother getting a real gold bar.) And on the visual scales alone, it delivers. A good film, and one that I strongly recommend if you have any sense of humour whatsoever. 8/10",
         "Inspector Gadget is back, well, kind of. French Stewart takes over the title role from Matthew Broderick, who appeared in the original live action film. In the first film, our beloved G took down arch enemy The Claw so this movie opens with G on top of the world. As a result of him being praised and awarded by the city, G has become a bit smug and too sure of himself. Therefore, he is soon arresting the police chief's MOTHER for driving 26 mph in a 25 zone. The crime is drag racing. Needless to say, G gets a chewing out from the chief (Mark Mitchell), his supervisor. Its true, G's bright niece Penny keeps her uncle more grounded, for she loves to catch criminals, too. Now, more changes occur. First, there is a new crime fighter on the force, a robot, G2, (Elaine Hendrix), who has just been invented and will be more reliable than G, whose gadgets sometimes go haywire. Although she is a mechanical being, G finds her very pretty! Then, The Claw (Tony Martin, not Rupert Everett) returns with a surefire plan to raid the Federal Reserve. All of a sudden, G lassos the mayor (Sigrid Thornton) accidentally, making her so upset that she kicks G off the force. Needing a new job, G tries his hand at everything from burger flipping to valet parking. But, can G2 truly stop The Claw on her own? Well, she is supposed to be perfect! First, I have adored French Stewart from his days on Third Rock from the Sun. He is instinctively very funny, no matter what the role, and this is one is no exception. Hendrix makes a perfect counterpoint for him while Mitchell does well as the chief. How funny to see Thornton, long after her young role in The Man from Snowy River, she is still quite beautiful! Martin has a rough voice that is hard to decipher sometimes but he makes a good villain. He gets away in the end, setting up other possible sequels. Then, the production is gorgeous, inventive, colorful and fun. Lastly, there are laughs galore for every one. Therefore, inspect this film up close by showing it to yourself or your close friends and relatives soon.",
         "I just saw this movie on DVD. Having previously seen the original, and been a fan of the original cartoon series, I was itching to see what was done. Only one cast member from the first movie returned for this one: D. L. Hughly as the voice for the Gadgetmobile. French Stewart takes the title role from Matthew Broderick, and while Matthew's performance was one of the few weak performances of his career French nails the character dead-on. Tony Martin similarly nails The Claw over Rupert Everett's less-than-menacing performance. As for Caitlin Wachs versus Michelle Trachtenberg as Penny, I think the two are closely matched. And in nearly every way, Elaine Hendrix is unbeatable in the role of G2. Director Alex Zamm sought to bring the sequel closer in feel to the original series, and he achieves this with aplomb. The Inspector's enthusiastic idiocy, with Penny tagging along to bail him out, is the theme in what turns into a smörgåsbord of slapstick, visual puns, and other goodness. Personally, I would have preferred to keep the \"real name\" of John Brown used in the first film (for scenes where using the name would have been logical, including the deleted \"Penny at school\" scene), but that's the only substantial change I would have suggested. Not that the film is without weaknesses. Some \"bits,\" such as the unfortunate toilet-cleaning scene, could have been substantially shortened, and a couple of the deleted scenes (seen on the DVD) would have helped the movie flow a little better. But on the whole it's a fun romp fit for the whole family.",
         "If you are a fan of the cartoon Inspector Gadget (which itself is a great salute to \"Get Smart\" with the voice of Don Adams as Gadget), then you will enjoy IG2. This is the rare occasion where the original didn't come close enough to the cartoon for fans, but the sequel did! Rule of thumb: when making a movie about a TV show, stay as close as you realistically can to the TV show!! French Stewart does a much better job as Gadget, with just the right amount of seriousness AND silliness as Inspector Gadget. All the original cartoon elements (Chief Quimby, Dr. Claw (looking as anonymously menacing as he should!), Penny, and Brain) are here, and G2 was actually a very good addition to the \"Gadget family\". My whole family enjoyed it! The sequel got it right!",
         "I used to watch the Inspector Gadget Television show all of the time, and so going into the first movie I was hoping it would retain certain elements of the show. However, that first movie changed so much (the most notable being the odd reworking of Dr. Claw) that it didn't feel like Inspector Gadget anymore. This movie, on the other hand, is excellent, because it discards trying to be in continuity with the first in order to be much more like the show. The character dynamic of the show (including the faceless villian) has been restored. Now, Gadget is once again a bumbling idiot who is saved only by those around him. At first I thought the inclusion of G2 would hamper the film, but her part is well integrated and this is still Gadget's movie. It's very funny, silly, and stylized, and probably good enough to have been in theaters. Forget about the continuity errors in relation to the first film, and enjoy live-action Gadget the way it should have been in the first place. **** out of ****",
         "French Stewart, we hardly knew ye. We hardly knew ye beyond the showe thou callest \"Third Rock From The Sun\". Because, let every viewer face it, it will be his only real success in his career. Everything else will pale in comparison. Stewart, as Gadget, was weak. He arrests an old granny for going .3 mph over the speed limit. Kind of stupid and not even funny. The set up was all wrong. Plus enter G2 (Gadget 2), who is modeled as a woman, and Gadget likes her. For some reason, dumb robots fall for one another. What is so screwed is is that the Claw from the first one is no longer there. So this feels like a cheap original and not a very cheap sequel. Nobody from the original is in the sequel. And that is sad. Overall, its worse than the first. Sometimes shows should just be kept as cartoon and not turned into real life versions. And Inspector Gadget is such an example. \"F\"",
         "(spoilers???) This movie has restored my faith in Inspector Gadget. French Stewart acts almost as good as our friend in 2d. Although that darn car is quite dumb. This movie I have no complaints about it to a certain degree. Whoever thought Matthew broderick would have made a good gadget missed the point. The first movie was offensive to IG fans. It wasn't funny and it was very depressing. Hence. Forgettable. IG 2 is what IG 1 should have been. And I think that's what the creators here had in mind. Similar to say Highlander 3 coming after Highlander 2. acting as if the 2nd movie never happened. This is like a total laugh riot. And thank god.. Claw gets away. We want more sequels.!!!! 7/10 Quality: 6/10 (some loopy camera work) Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 10/10",
         "I don't understand how people insist this is worse then the other live action movie.... as it fixes so many things (not everything I mean they kept that offensive gadget mobile, but heck he even interacted better with Stewart) the biggest is French Stewart, how anyone can prefer Brodrick's performance to him makes me wonder if they even liked the original cartoon at all as Stewart nailed the role. Claw was also back in the shadows... where he belongs! The added female police robot woman was a bit of a dumb addition to say the least but still up to the level of idiocy in the first movie. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this is a great movie that warrant's praise, but as an Inspector Gadget fan if I got this when I went to theaters I would have left less offended then I did.",
         "Disney today has gone through multiple changes throughout its history. There's the classical period, the slump period, the renaissance period and the rise to super studio power in the late 2000s. However even during the 1990s when Disney was breaking records in its animated films, they also were breaking records in flops in another type of film. Those films were in live-action, many of which were derived from cartoons from decades before. For those cases, Disney had made some pretty bad films. Mr. Magoo (1997), George of the Jungle (1997) and Inspector Gadget (1999) being relatively the last bunch of theatrical releases to be made, for the most part signaled the end of such cartoon live-action adaptations. But even for Disney, nothing would stop the studio giant from making a little extra cash even after that. Some years later, Disney would release sequels to some of these movies and for the poorly adapted Inspector Gadget (1999), he too got his own. The question is, is it worth a watch? Ehhh,...in some respects yes because there seems to be improvement. Then again, there really was no need to begin with because a sequel will not make up for the mistakes of the first. With a script written by the director Alex Zamm (Chairman of the Board (1998), Tooth Fairy 2 (2012) and Jingle All the Way 2 (2014)) and two other writers, the adaptation part of the film is more faithful to that of the original cartoon. And for some viewers, that may be all they need because the entirety of the movie does feel more cartoonish than that of the first movie. When Dr. Claw (Tony Martin) escapes from prison, it's up to Inspector Gadget (French Stewart), his niece Penny (Caitlin Wachs) and newly activated member G2 (Elaine Hendrix) to bring the evil mastermind to justice. The idea is as routine as ever but it again sticks to the formula that made the cartoon what it was. Also what makes this film more faithful than the one before is that most of Dr. Claw's face is kept concealed from the audience. It was a big gripe people had with the 1999 film. As stated in the plot prior, much of the cast from the first film have been replaced or rewritten out. The only actor who didn't get replaced was D.L. Hughley as the Gadget Mobile; because people loved him the most? Also there's no mention of whatever happened to Joely Fisher's role as Brenda who played Gadget's love interest in the first movie. French Stuart as Gadget looks more like his cartoon counterpart than Matthew Broderick. Caitlin Wachs taking over Michelle Trachtenberg's role performed okay but nothing special. As for Claw, Tony Martin's portrayal Vs Rupert Everett is not hilariously funny but it's alright. Elaine Hendrix as G2 was okay even though her role was very contrived. It's pretty obvious what she serves as to Gadget. If there's one thing that stays true through this film is that almost every actor chews up the scenery around them. Almost every scene is super hammy. It's not bad occasionally or maybe for one character but even the less important characters are biting at the corners of every frame. With that being said, the comedy isn't that funny either. Thankfully, Disney toned down the inappropriate humor from the first film but didn't bother fix anything else. The one liners are formulaic and predictable but they do at least sound more believable being delivered from Stewart than Broderick. Dr. Claw also has a bunch of stock henchman that do act like the cartoon but here just feel silly. Of all things, why would Dr. Claw hire a single ninja? Also sometimes the dialog doesn't make a lot of sense due to certain characters having knowledge that goes unexplained. How would one specific character know how a mechanical device works if the villain didn't even give the obligatory exposition to them? The stretch of the imagination only goes so far. Seeing Dr. Claw make a weapon out of 3 or 4 non-connective items is one thing, but knowing how it works without even being told? Yeah,...not buying it. Even with this mediocre writing, there is still some visual integrity. The special effects to this entry are adequate for its budget even though they are not as polished as the first film. However considering it was 12 million Vs 75 million (estimated), that's not entirely bad. There are places where it's noticeably fake though. The cinematography shot by Geoffrey Wharton who is usually just a camera operator does okay here. There's no strange angles or up close facial zoom-ins so that's praiseworthy. Anything else though is just standard shooting. The musical score composed by Chris Hajian is okay too. Even though the sound is not as bombastic as John Debney's version of the first one, Hajian retains the Inspector Gadget theme and does what he can to make it sound acceptable for a DVD sequel. The overall product is still messy but some may like it more than the original film. Having its cast mainly replaced, the actors are a lot hammier, the comedy is still predictable and the effects do look somewhat cheaper. However some of the writing does follow the cartoon more this time than the first movie and although not everything makes sense it feels more like an extended cartoon episode. So that kind works in its favor.",
         "The first inspector gadget movie, ignored everything about the show and instead started its own thing. But with inspector gadget 2 they had all the elements, all the things that inspector gadget was about. Claw being hidden, penny solving the case, gadget being an idiot as usual ignoring the most obvious things, just like the cartoon. Although it isn't the best movie I've seen, its not the worst either, this movie is just a \"MEH\" in general, i can say this is more \"inspector gadget\" then the first movie was. So ignore the first one, watch this one. You can take the cartoon as this movies prequel, and let it just be about gadget finding a woman or whatever you want it to be this movie is inspector gadget, the other movie is inspector someone else",
         "I saw the first and loved it. The second one had new actors, a totally different plot, nothing from the first film is recognized. However, they have MANY laughs, many cool special effects, and so on. Also, the way they presented the story, although kind of lame, was done well. But I watched this with my 7 year old sister who did enjoy it quite well and I was surprised that she wasn't scared during the \"Scary parts\" The DVD actually contains a lot of potentially interesting and informative information about how they made the movie, which is helping me as a wannabe-filmer to get ideas and knowledge about filming. So I rate this 5/10, mostly because of humor and special effects.",
         "I hate this movie so much with love.I love French Stewart,but I hate him in this.This film makes no sense what so ever.How did claw get old when this film takes place 4 years later.Why didn't penny get older.Why does the town look different.Why is Gadget still stupid when his glitches are fix.Why ask why.This is stupid.Too many question,none of the answers."

         "On the outskirts of Riverton, \"The Safest City in America\", a pensive Inspector Gadget sits in his Gadgetmobile, along with his canine companion, Brain. Gadget is back on the job, on stakeout, but he is concerned that everything is too quiet in Riverton. He has a very simple, rational answer to this; \" it's always the most quiet just before criminals strike\". Evil must be afoot. In a moment of overzealous crime fighting Gadget arrests an elderly women for wreckless driving, but not without incident. In his effort to make the arrest Gadget's many crime fighting \"accessories\" go wildly astray. It's time to report back to headquarters for a checkup. Baxter, the \"Q\" of the Police Department, delivers the prognosis - as he is a prototype things are bound to have some glitches. The remedy is close at hand. But, before Baxter can tell of his new \"top secret\", Gadget is confronted by a furious Chief Quimby. The little old lady arrested earlier for wreckless driving turns out to be Quimby's mother. Gadget is put on notice - any more mistakes and he is on probation. Meanwhile, in the dead of night, and in a raging storm, something happens that will change Gadget's destiny forever - his arch enemy, his nemesis, Claw makes a daring escape from Riverton Prison. Now, evil really is afoot. Chief Quimby offers Inspector Gadget one last chance to redeem himself through the capture, and return to incarceration, of Claw. And so the chase begins.",
         "Still in the police force, Inspector Gadget is reduced to sitting around. After capturing Claw, all the criminals have gone into hiding until, Claw escapes! Gadget thinks he will get the case, but everyone else has other planes. A new version of the Gadget project is unveiled in the form of G2. Strict orders are given for Gadget to stay away from G2 and every crime scene, but Gadget feels he is needed more than anyone.",
         "Inspector Gadget returns in this sequel to the 1999 hit, \"Inspector Gadget.\" Gadget once again has to fight his arch nemesis, Claw."
