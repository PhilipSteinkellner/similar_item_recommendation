         "Young and wild is a film about adolescence, self-imposed boundaries, religion, and spirituality. Perhaps the unique hitch is that, rather than being told by a mature and seasoned (read curmudgeonly) adult, it is told unflinchingly through the eyes of its protagonist, a seventeen- year-old Chilean girl named Daniela. A local legend, even in real life, Daniela maintains a detailed blog of her sexual exploits and deepest thoughts. Through a creative use of Chilean pop-music, graphics, and editing, the audience is let into this world. The content of the film is shocking, explicit, and (at moments) even pornographic. Thus with a surface level look, it would be easy to condemn it on this basis, However, writing it off wholesale would risk losing the truth depicted in Daniela's personal spiritual struggle. Here we experience, as much as we can, what it feels like to be a teenager under the iron thumb of mature Christian shame (not Daniela's, but her mother's). While it is true that director Marialy Rivas goes over the top to be outrageous (I could not help but avert my eyes at certain moments), it is also true that if it wasn't explicit in some ways, it couldn't claim to tell Daniela's actual story from her perspective. Aside from my shock at the graphic sexuality, my primary emotional response to the film was sadness. As a human being, I too have lived in the tension of knowingly, willingly, happily stepping into wrong/unhelpful behavior (we call it 'sin' in the Christian world-view) and yet believed in and tried to follow a God who is not OK with that. I too have lived in the tension of being in a community in which I assumed that I was the only one to have shameful secrets. It is a lonely place to exist; and I don't think it has to be that way. Thus my sadness is twofold: for Daniela's despair and isolation (she eventually fully embraces her wild side admitting \"I am Lost, I am Lost, I am Lost\"), and for the ineptitude of the church to teach an open and humble path of living for real people who make mistakes that run the gamut of human experience. As a Christian pastor, it is on me to demonstrate authenticity and the kind of truth that Young and Wild explores.",
         "YOUNG AND WILD (dir. Marialy Rivas) A sexy and thought provoking film from Chile about a young woman's journey to sexual maturity and the problems posed by her domineering and overbearing family. Because Daniella receives nothing but banal Christian platitudes about her emerging sexuality, she shares her private anguish and confusion with friends on the Internet in her blog entitled, \"Young & Wild\". The film makes the point that evangelical acculturation is only psychological coercion sweetened with biblical aphorisms, and offers no real answers and only false comfort. Daniella comes to reject the relentless dogma of her parents, and learns to accept the undetermined nature of life. She seems to realize that it's healthier to embrace an uncertain existence without doctrine than to be conned with pious nonsense, and Daniella's family inadvertently prods her into an acceptance of a more secular humanistic world-view. MUST SEE",
         "Ever since the surprise success of \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\", Latin American filmmakers have realized they can compete with Hollywood, and even successfully export Spanish-language films to North America, if they make films that contain a strong dose of the kind of sexual explicitness their more Puritanical northern neighbors tend to shy away from. Unfortunately, few of these films are nearly as good as \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" and are more likely to approach the dismal depths of something like \"Night Buffalo\". This Chilean movie is about a girl in her late teens who is kicked out of her evangelical school for having sex and decides to start a blog to rebel against her community and overbearing religious mother. Her blog involves her talking about having all manner of sex (oral, anal, you name it) with partners of both genders. And, not surprisingly, a lot of this sex occurs on camera. The problem with this movie is it is neither fish nor fowl. It kind of wants to be a serious art film, but the character is just not particularly believable. Nothing that happens to her really justifies her rather extreme rebellion. The movie wants to take it as a given that religious repression will inevitably result in promiscuity and jaded sexual attitudes, but it doesn't SHOW how it happened with THIS character very convincingly. I would compare this movie--unfavorably--to the excellent Argentinean film \"The Holy Girl\", which much more believable portrays the nexus between religion and sex. The lead, Alicia Rodriquez, is definitely very cute, and with all the graphic sex scenes this movie could have at least been solid exploitation. But while it definitely has enough hot sex scenes to qualify, to really do this it would need to make the character LESS realistic and sympathetic and much more satirical. An example of this would be the recent US indie film \"King Kelly\" about very hot, but very stupid, fame-obsessed young woman who sets out to become an internet porn star. This movie is only slightly more realistic than that scathing satire, and it is also not as much fun.",
         "This one was a surprise for me. I expect most foreign films to be good, but this one was really different, and make you really engage your brain. First of all, if you don't understand the language, you have to read subtitles, and there's such rapid dialogue, that you have to read fast or you'll miss out. Which means you tend to miss a bit of the visuals, but it can be done without missing too much. As for the story, it's fascinating, and pretty disturbing, to see the lengths an evangelical family will go to try to keep their daughter from having sex. Let's just say \"slut shaming\" is taken to an extreme level in this family. You can feel the poor girl's angst; it's not pleasant. This movie explores the darker side of growing up and trying to find one's place in the world. It's not for prudes or people afraid of human sexuality. 7/10 stars.",
         "Living in the American South's Bible Belt, I am deeply familiar with the kind of intense religious bombardment the protagonist experienced -- it's pretty much par for the course for any place or subculture where religious fundies have a grip. I thought the movie did an EXCELLENT job of portraying this aspect of the film. I thought maybe mother was a WEE bit over the top hateful and intrusive, not that I don't believe mothers like her exist, but that I think the filmmaker missed a big chance of portraying the way kindness can also be used as a tool for psychological manipulation. The part the filmmaker UTTERLY screwed up was helping us understand the reason for the protagonist's rebellion. Was it adolescent angst, a healthy sexuality growing and rebelling against the repression, or just a healthy human response to the general repressiveness of evangelical beliefs? We have no idea, because the idiot filmmaker just gave us lots of shots of the lead actress looking sullen instead of any meaningful dialog that would have helped us UNDERSTAND the reason for all the sullenness. Of course, there was a lot of dialog with other young people on her blog that MIGHT have been illuminating, but it wasn't. It was just the usual shallow talk of normal teens about sex. I was hoping for more depth, more insight, than a teen might have about the issues raised in the movie. I didn't get that. A shame, because without it, the movie is a real nothingburger.",
         "The film was great for soft porn because that's exactly what it was. Those who thought it \"sacrilegious\" (at the Sundance Festival) should probably stick to romantic comedies and those who thought the film was original should probably watch more French cinema. You can sometimes overcome the soft porn classification with a rich storyline but this film doesn't have that. It has been made many times before�only better. The story: Protagonist, Daniela, is a girl raised in a religious Evangelical environment but wants to have sex with anything warm-blooded and human; girl finally gets a boyfriend; girl then finds a girlfriend too; girl suddenly wants to be baptized; boy finds out about same-sex encounters; boy leaves girl because boy is religious and ashamed. Daniela spends most of her time in this movie looking for sex and resisting her Evangelical surroundings. Her boyfriend finds out about the same-sex relationship because she spends much of her time blogging about it whenever she gets a chance. He tells her mother about it and dumps Daniela, thus also causing her to part ways with her mother. Young & Wild shifts from curious promiscuity, to sexual acts, to punishment (kicked out of school, of course), then adaptation (the boyfriend her mother accepts), to eventual sex with the boyfriend, and then to a contextual red herring that detracts from any promise of a clear message: The same-sex relationship. I didn't see that the film added anything different in terms of methodology or content, and it lacked a clear focus, starting with an implied struggle over theism, which ends quickly once we learn that the main character is not an atheist but only \"afraid\" to believe in God. This theme of fear, like many others, never resurfaces. We never learn how she copes with the dissociation from her family and church and never see the post-climactic dynamics between Daniela and her ex-boyfriend, or Daniela and her family. There were many opportunities here to do something interesting with the blogging aspect of the story (privacy and the naiveté of a young blogger), and lots could have been done to explore Daniela's mysterious and unrealized decision to be baptized. Young & Wild appears to be an indecisive agglomeration of three separate themes that the director should have narrowed down or conjoined in a more coherent manner: Soft Lolita porn, religious sexual dichotomy and bisexuality.",
         "Called me prick or stupid, but the first impression I got from this movie was sex and wild. But, it turn out wrong and really disappoint, But, I have to say this is called soft core. Many nudity, topless female, fellatio (there is no explicit fellatio, just made it look like explicit), erection from lead male actor (it's ashamed because probably fake, and of course classic soft core heritage, lesbian sex. Than you'll know the rest. The title very convincing, \"Young and Wild\". Yeah, they are \"young\" but very lack of \"wildness\". I guess the movie director, Marialy Rivas, want to tell us how big the gap between people with lustful thought and sinner compare to religious people with their holiness. Doesn't obvious? The young lead actress, Daniela Ramírez (played by Alicia Luz Rodríguez)was taking school in religious school and eventually got expelled because the teacher know she had sex which is banned. At the time, she begin to write Blog and discuss about sex with many stranger. Than she become wild after got punishment work at religious section and met a boy and fall. Well, she succeed seduce him and get fellatio and than had sex, but it turn our bad after the boy discover that Daniela liked woman too. They broke up and fin. Marialy Rivas actually have a good story material but execution really wrong. That's the biggest problem.",
         "Before us is the debut full-length motion picture director and screenwriter Mariano Rivas, whose name does not reflect fully the whole savagery \"Wild Kitty\". Treats for everyone: masturbation, classic, anal and oral sex, bisexuality - in the film shows how all this with great candor and unvarnished. Call this picture can not be shocking. On the screen we see something that is not often seen in life, and this can not be surprised. Call this propaganda picture of sexual freedom and irresponsibility, too impossible, for us in the best represented the struggle of motives in the minds of the main character, 17-year-old girl (probably nymphomaniac) Daniel, played by a young Alicia Rodriguez. This film, in my opinion - an illustration of modern attitudes toward sexuality, and for emphasis using maximum amplification of this ratio in the face of the protagonist. Also, for even more expressive character Alicia very strongly contrasts with the Puritans, evangelicals from his family, his fellow believers and with sanctimonious Christian TV channel, which she referred to the working mother as punishment for seduction student in a religious school. To illustrate this modern attitude successful method used: Danielle is the internet blog called «Joven y alocada» (which translated from Spanish means \"young and reckless\"), which describes his sexual adventures, and hundreds of internet users commented this. Today's Internet users this may sound funny, because in the film shows a good prevails there trolling. This blog - frame film. Each new post that the main character calls immodestly gospel - is a new chapter movie. And, despite the corruption of some offscreen monologues spoken by it, some of them are still visible logic, some of them can claim to be a reflection of reality. Retell them, would be to deprive you of most interest (itself) to watch a movie and make your own conclusions. I'm up to the final credits thought Daniel - is the fruit of the author's imagination, exaggerated reflection of modern sexuality. But, as we voice-over narrates the last monologue (which I initially took to be a hoax director), the film - biography. At the main character is the prototype, some Camila Gutierrez. This is her life presented to us in the most vivid colors movies qualifications \"to 18 no-no.\" Report viewer with irony about it in the last seconds, in my opinion, the strongest reception illustration of all that has been used during the film. First, someone came into our heads the idea that the director has decided to withdraw the biography of the Chilean experience with German schoolgirl porn actress, who wrote about it in secret around the world. Second, sexual promiscuity Daniela against reigning around Puritanism create a strong contrast (which I wrote below), which does not seem natural, and that's why I did not come up with the idea of \u200b\u200bbiographical films. In the film, though, and in the background, raises a question of contemporary bisexuality. Throwing the heroine between a girl, a colleague from the channel, and a true believer kid, too, with the channel, it reflects the current trend, which is most visible in modern girls (not just my opinion, and the vast number of data Sex Research). What I do not like is the fact that trivialize scripture. And if you do not like me, an atheist, it is not difficult to imagine the perception of the believer. Guess vulgarization of religion prototype Daniela worked very active, since it plays such an important place in the whole structure of the film. What is the main idea of \u200b\u200bthe film?! Is not it that a man with such a way of life and he has no future, in the end, just left alone?! From the main character everyone turned and character of her aunt, who also led not the best way of life to it again highlighted the whole family had cancer. This element is designed to show films this (my opinion). Perhaps, the film focuses on a mature audience, and as a parent would shout \"Be vigilant, and in Puritan families grow here such copies.\" I think that all at once. Fill job Rivas only by a single sense - narrow thinking. \"Wild Pussy\" - a movie on time. Looked, analyzed, understood, concluding forgotten. No more, no less. If you do not so much concern that an erection in response to explicit scenes mute all conversations, monologues, and Puritan, as you draw in the film evangelists, and be able to regard the content of the film is adequate, it is worth to see. If we abstract from what is happening on the screen and think only about the inherent ideas - the sight appears very intense and meaningful work."
