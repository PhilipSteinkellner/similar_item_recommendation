         "This film by David de Vos provides an interesting mix and look into both current science theories and Christian beliefs. A scientist's wife dies during childbirth, and the son is given up for adoption only to reappear later in the scientist's life. There are discussions and ramblings of the elder scientist as to the \"string theory\" to explain the universe, which he attempts to use in order to find his deceased wife, and in turn, God. There are many turns of faith, both Christian and scientific, along with some other sidetracking issues (putting the scientist in a hospital, losing the family home, an affair, etc), that add to the plot. Overall this is a decent production, leaning perhaps a bit much on the Christian aspect (depending on your views). This might have had a more interesting ending as a true Sci-Fi flick, but is a satisfying film overall. Definitely something that the whole family could watch.",
         "The story had great promise, but I'm not even sure how this movie made its way to the shelves of a national movie rental chain, to be honest. It seems more like a movie that would have been dropped off in your mailbox anonymously for a Christianity movement. I'm Christian and I love science. Both of which seem underrepresented in this film. I could nitpick the visual quality of the DVD, but the acting was much worse; something along the lines of a bad after-school special. The science aspect was the main reason I watched this movie, and on some level, they were right on track. Most of the theories cited are incongruous, which is true, but are all we can prove of physics and how the universe works. Hence, searching for that missing link, particle, or force. For that alone, I added 3 stars. If you're looking for a sappy flick, find another. If you're looking for a science based flick, find another. If you're looking for a really bad version of both; you win.",
         "This is a very emotional story about a father and son searching for God and connecting with each other along the way. The father is a scientist trying to prove the existence of God and heaven through physics and mathematics. There's a lot of talk about things beyond what we can see. (i.e. String Theory, Multiple Dimensions, etc.) When the father comes down with a brain disorder, the son must help him see what his equations and mathematics cannot show. The film does a great job of building characters that you care about, and showing the importance of family and faith. I really loved how it showed that reason can be a stepping stone for faith. That the two work together, not against each other. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie, as did my family.",
         "When I rent this movie, I had just finished reading the great book \"The god Formula\" that will be released in September in USA with the name \"The Einstein Enigma\", by Jose Rodrigues dos Santos. The book explains the principles of Einstein and his search for the theory of everything. I Thought I would find some interesting explanations an research about that but find nothing in this movie. If you have time, read the book. This author writes thrillers like no one else can do nowadays. You learn in each book he writes. The movie is misleading because the story is more about a son finding his real father than telling about the theory of everything.",
         "This film is \"A Beautiful Mind\" mets \"Good Will Hunting\"! It seems like it may have been a low budget film, but isn't that how Matt Damon and Ben Affleck got their start? And then they won Oscars for it. I truly enjoyed this movie which touched me in a deep way. The characters and dialogue were believable and the story inspiring. I loved seeing the relationships between the husband, Doug, and his wife, Abby, grow and deepen. I also enjoyed seeing the transforming love of a father for his son. Even though there are Christian themes, I think anyone (Christian or non-Christian) would be able to relate to these complex characters, their struggles, and the profoundly human story at the heart of it. I highly recommend it. It also is a family-friendly movie. I would be able to sit next to children in the theater or in my home and feel good about the fact that they're watching it with me. Now, how often can you say that about a movie that's not Disney or rated G? Check it out!"
