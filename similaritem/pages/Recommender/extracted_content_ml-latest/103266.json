         "In the first two Mr. Moto films, Moto was a complex and rather amoral man. If someone tried to kill him, often Moto killed that person instead. Additionally, you weren't always sure who Moto worked for or his motivations. I liked this, as it made his character a bit mysterious and quite a bit unlike the studio's other Asian crime fighter, Charlie Chan. However, with MR. MOTO'S GAMBLE the transition to a Charlie Chan clone has occurred. Why? Well the answer is that this film originally WAS a Charlie Chan film and shortly into shooting it was obvious that Warner Oland (Chan) was not emotionally fit enough to finish the film. So, instead of scrapping the film, they just altered it slightly to make it a Moto film. So was this a successful move by the studio? Well, in some ways definitely not. The comic relief for the film was provided by Max 'Slapsie Maxie' Rosenbloom--playing a guy even more annoying and unrealistic than Mantan Moreland would play in the later Charlie Chan films. Frankly, I hated Rosenbloom in the film because he detracted from the mystery with his antics. Additionally, it seemed very strange for the Japanese detective to be teamed with Charlie's #1 Son, Lee Chan (Keye Luke). In fact, you will probably notice that Moto treats Lee pretty much the way Charlie did and it just feels odd. And, since Moto was essentially playing Chan, he had much less to do in this film than in previous ones. Like Chan, he was NOT the focal point of the film and aside from a couple judo flips, you'd barely notice him in the film. In essence, Mr. Moto was dead. Despite this obviously being a Chan film (and second-rate due to the dominant presence of Rosenbloom), the film is still pretty good--provided you don't mind that it's not a Moto movie. The mystery itself isn't bad (though the squirt gun angle was pretty dumb) and the film worked pretty well. While the mechanical gun at the end was overly complex, how Moto used this was pretty neat. Overall, I give it a 6. It's interesting and fun but suffers a severe case of too much Rosenbloom and multiple personality disorder! By the way, there are some famous faces buried within the film. Ward Bond (famous for his many appearances in support of John Wayne) plays the Champion, George E. Stone ('Runt' from the Boston Blackie films) and a young Lon Chaney, Jr. is in a bit role. For more on how this film came to be, watch the DVD extra included along with MR. MOTO'S GAMBLE. MR. MOTO MEETS MR. CHAN is indispensable for die-hard fans like myself to understand the very troubled process through which this film was made.",
         "Warner Oland made a reputation playing orientals which is what got him the role of Erle Derr Biggers Honolulu detective in the first place. Not bad for a Swedish American actor. Unfortunately, he lost the role in a very unexpected way. He died. Now, before you go and try to figure out who done it, don't bother. These things happen and not always through foul play. Now, Peter Lorre had made his name playing a child murderer in a little German film called \"M\" and that eventually brought him to the U.S. and this Hungarian Jew was suddenly thrust into the role intended for character actor J. Edward Bromberg (who coincidentally played a raja in a Moto film.) Amazingly, Loree, being the terrific actor he was became very believable as a Japanese detective well practiced in the art of jiu jitsu and karate. Now I have said all that to say that Lorre's Moto was thrust into this film when Olaand died and the Chan script was completed. With a little rewrite, it became the picture I am reviewing here, and it is a doozy. It even has the wonderful character actor John Hamilton (later to be famous as Perry White of the Daily Planet on the \"Superman\" TV series) as one of his many mayor/D.A./warden/person in authority role/ With the able comic relief of Keye Luke's number one son and over-sized, cauliflower pug 'Slapsy' Maxie Rosenbloom, and a dandy mystery. Now, I won't give you a spoiler here, but I will tell you that if you have watched enough whodunits as I have, you will see the same mystery kickers replayed dozens of times, or at least a couple. This particular murder puzzle I saw no less than three times counting this one. Once in a syndicated \"The New Adventures of Charlie Chan\" series starring J. Carroll Naish (another character actor who played all sorts of ethnics other than his own ethnic background) another TV show called \"Burke's Law,\" and still another TV show featuring detective \"Ellery Queen\" played by the always talented late, great Jim Hutton. And it all happens in a boxing ring. Just watch the film and have fun with it. After all, we're not talking Shakespeare here. Just good, fun bloodless murder and fun characters you'll enjoy for company. I give it a 7 out of ten stars for that.",
         "Due to the illness of Chan star Warner Oland, this film's script had to be turned into a Mr. Moto movie. I feel this is the weakest entry in the Fox Moto series with Peter Lorre. The film is set in the New York boxing world. I've never been a fan of boxing--so the atmosphere did nothing for me. Lorre is his usual great self. That can't be taken away. And the film has the bonus of Keye Luke reprising his role as Charlie's Number One Son, Lee Chan, for the last time at 20th Century Fox. (He would play the Lee role twice more in the last two Monogram Chans.) But even with Lorre and Luke, this one is a bit weak. It might have been better if filmed with Mr. Oland as an actual Charlie Chan film. Still--it is worth seeing.",
         "Although originally intended as a Chan film maybe not surprisingly it's easy to switch to Moto Mode and enjoy what we've got. Not being a boxing fan is much harder to overcome! A boxer is murdered mid-fight, under the eyes of the multitude and especially Moto's pair of roving eyes, the job is on to find whodunit and how. Peter Lorre was excellent as usual, even hampered with comedy duo no.2 Chan son Lee and kleptomaniac Knockout Wellington. Favourite bit : where someone shouts \"Whoever heard of a crooked cop?\" and everyone laughs uproariously - in disbelief! The best thing about this Moto though is the never ending stream of then current Fox background actors appearing, from Doug Fowley, chunky Cliff Clark, George E. Stone ï¿½ even Lon Chaney Jr down to Paul Fix, Ward Bond, Fred Kelsey ï¿½ why, everyone at the studio was here except Warner Oland! A nice series entry [3/8], all well worth watching if you're a fan of the genre like me.",
         "Those familiar with the background of this movie know that it started out as \"Charlie Chan at Ringside\", and was hastily re-cast when Warner Oland died. Keye Luke maintained his role as Number #1 Son Lee Chan, and Harold Huber appeared as head of the homicide department, similar to the roles he played in a pair of Chan films just prior to \"Mr. Moto's Gamble\". They included a New York City police inspector (Charlie Chan on Broadway), and a French police officer (Charlie Chan at Monte Carlo). In this outing he plays it just a bit straighter, though his character gets a little erratic as the film progresses. What was interesting to me was how the film makers managed to get in a reference to Charlie Chan, as son Lee extends his regards to Mr. Moto from his 'pop', and Moto graciously praises the masterful work of the senior detective. All the while I was trying to catch a hint of recognition in Keye Luke's facial manner for a reaction to Oland's passing, but that did not materialize. Also interesting, and maybe more so, was the way this film maintained the continuity of the early Twentieth Century Fox series of Charlie Chan films. The movie completed by Warner Oland and Keye Luke just prior to this one was \"Charlie Chan at Monte Carlo\", and in that story, Lee Chan had a painting on exhibition in Paris. In 'Gamble', Lee is an aspiring detective taking one of Mr. Moto's classes, however officially he's enrolled as a university art student. I always found those subtle and clever inserts into the pictures to heighten my enjoyment of the films. As for the story itself, Mr. Moto becomes involved in the 'poison glove' killing at the request of Lieutenant Riggs (Huber), and is only too happy to oblige. He solves the crime in a more linear fashion than Charlie Chan would have, with enough clues along the way to help the viewer hone in on the killer - \"To reveal a snake one must overturn a rock\". Along the way, 'Slapsie' Maxie Rosenbloom provides some comic relief as a scatterbrained kleptomaniac, and it was cool to see Ward Bond as boxing champ Biff Moran. There was one element though that just didn't make sense. When it was agreed to lift boxer Steele's (Dick Baldwin) suspension so he could fight for the world title, THAT VERY SAME NIGHT!!!, newspaper headlines around the country carried the story! Just how fast could news possibly travel back in the 1930's? Hey, when was the last time you could get ringside seats to a main event for $4.40? Obviously 1938, but you'd pay more for a hot dog at the matches today. \"Mr. Moto's Gamble\" was the third installment in the Moto series at Fox, and once again, Peter Lorre blends his insightful analysis and martial arts skill into an effective effort. You might feel at times he's putting up with the clunkiness of Lee Chan and detective Riggs, which is what Charlie Chan would have had to do, but in the end you have a satisfying story that paces solid detective work in a sports setting.",
         "I'd consider this one of the better of Peter Lorre's eight Mr. Moto films, with a good story of ringside gambling and crooks. The mysterious Japanese investigator must unravel what happened when a boxer was killed during a match. This one's got a well rounded cast too, beginning with Keye Luke making an appearance as none other than Charlie Chan's son, who is enrolled in a class which Mr. Moto is teaching. Also featuring Lon Chaney Jr. as a thug, and John Hamilton (Perry White on TV's SUPERMAN), too. Former real-life boxer-turned-actor Maxie Roosenbloom is the dimwitted comic relief. While watching and enjoying this entry I had the feeling that this was not in the same mold as previous Moto films I've seen. It was after the movie ended that I learned why via an informative bonus feature on the DVD -- MR. MOTO'S GAMBLE was originally scripted to be another Warner Oland Charlie Chan film for Fox, but Oland was having problems at the time, so the script was rebooted as a Mr. Moto film, with Peter Lorre practically doing Warner Oland. *** out of ****",
         "Favorite movie-quote - \"Who ever heard of a crooked cop?\" To be perfectly honest, Peter Lorre is one of those actors who has always given me the creeps, big-time. To me, Lorre has the sort of \"limited\" screen persona that's clearly best suited for roles where the character is either seriously unhinged and/or operating from the wrong side of the law. In his Mr. Moto role, Lorre was neither unhinged nor of a criminal mind. On the contrary, Mr. Moto was an exceptionally brilliant professor of criminology whose deductions and quick-mindedness were positively uncanny. In fact, Mr. Moto's cool, collected and matter-of-fact demeanour was, at times, really too much to be believed (but, after all, this was just a movie), especially since it was Lorre who played the part. Had the story-line of this lighthearted, 1938, Whodunnit not been about the world of professional boxing (and the criminal element that gets involved when big bucks are at stake), then I doubt that it would have held my interest as much as it inevitably did. When it comes to the likes of pugs and palookas & chumps and champs, I really enjoy early-Hollywood boxing pictures where double-crosses, treachery and taking a dive are the name of the game. Mind you, with that said, I think this film would've faired a helluva lot better had another actor, other than Lorre, been cast in the Mr. Moto role. Anyways - I sure did like real-life professional boxer, Max Rosenbloom, in the part of the pickpocket, \"Knockout\" Wellington. And at a 72-minute running time, this strictly formulaic, little Murder/Mystery certainly did move along at a nice, brisk clip.",
         "Mr. Moto (Peter Lorre) investigates a murder during a boxing match, with unwanted help from Charlie's Chan's \"Number One Son\" Lee (Keye Luke). Most people probably know this, but originally this was intended to be a Charlie Chan film. But when troubled Chan star Warner Oland walked off the set, they reworked the story and turned it into a Moto movie. This explains the appearance of Lee Chan. It also explains why Mr. Moto is less edgy than in his first two films. Here he resemble a more traditional detective like Charlie Chan. While I love Charlie Chan, Peter Lorre is kind of wasted in this type of role. He's better suited to roles with a little menace to them. Keye Luke is fine but the chemistry and rapport he had with Warner Oland is missing. Also appearing are Harold Huber, Douglas Fowley, and beautiful Lynn Bari -- each no stranger to the Charlie Chan series. In addition, there's Ward Bond, George E. Stone, and Maxie Rosenbloom. Lon Chaney, Jr. has a small part. Given the troubled backstory behind the movie, I'm surprised it turns out as well as it does. But a good cast goes a long way with these old detective movies.",
         "Asian detectives, as far as 20th Century Fox was concerned, are interchangeable, so producers had no trouble turning this Charlie Chan film into a Mr. Moto one. Apparently there was some sort of problem between Fox and the current Chan, Warner Oland, so they did a switch. I know some people state the film was switched because Warner Oland died, but he didn't die until five months after this film was released. Anyway, Mr. Moto is teaching a class in the science of investigation and who should one of his students be but Lee Chan (Keye Luke). And it's quite a cast: Lynn Bari, Slapsie Maxie Rosenbloom, John Hamilton (Perry White from the TV Superman), Ward Bond, and Lon Chaney Jr. Moto becomes involved in the death of a prize fighter after he's knocked out in the ring, but it turns out the man was murdered with poison on the opponent's glove. Peter Lorre is just terrific, and while this isn't the greatest Mr. Moto film ever made, he's wonderful. Unfortunately, after Pearl Harbor, Mr. M kind of disappeared.",
         "Big problems here. As others have pointed out, this film started out as a Charlie Chan film, but he proved unavailable, so the studio rewrote it as a Mr. Moto caper; it even has Chan's \"No. 1 Son\" in a supporting role. Watching the picture, it's very easy to imagine Charlie Chan doing and saying everything that Mr. Moto says. This film lacks the martial arts and international intrigue of the better Mr. Moto titles, thus it is not a Mr. Moto film. If you are looking for a real Mr. Moto film, get a different movie. This one is a Charlie Chan movie, starring Mr. Moto. Most unfortunate. Charlie Chan is Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto is Mr. Moto; this film blurs the distinctions and should be shunned by all lovers of either detective."

         "Bad blood exists between Bill Steele and Frankie Stanton, the leading contenders for the heavyweight title, and a grudge match is scheduled. Steele's knockout victory is tainted by his opponent's untimely death, ostensibly from a concussion caused by hitting the canvas. A post-mortem reveals that poison was somehow introduced into a cut above Stanton's eye although it is unclear how and why. Gambling might seem to be the motive as several of the principle suspects, gamblers Clipper McCoy and Nick Crowder, Stanton's shady manager Jerry Connors, and fight promoter Philip Benton, all seemed to have made wagers on the fight. Benton's spoiled daughter and female reporter Penny Kendall are vying for the affections of Steele, who is now slated to fight for the championship against pugnacious Biff Moran. Lt. Riggs of New York Homicide and Moto, who were spectators at the fight, go on the trail of the murderer following the autopsy results. Moto's prime suspect is a shadowy character named John Howard, who collected on huge bets in four different Midwestrern cities after the Stanton fight. Discovering his real identity will be a key to Moto's TKO of the killer.",
