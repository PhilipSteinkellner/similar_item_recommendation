         "The cast of these brilliant actors was \"let loose\" during the filming and delivered a shining, wild and immensely funny theatrical comedy, full of buffoonery and harlequin-style acrobatics. Actors themselves were confessing that the filming itself was a comedy and was enjoyed more like a party then a work. This fun can be felt through the whole film.",
         "For this 1975 Soviet TV adaptation of a farcical play that was first performed in 1892, director Viktor Titov seems to have held the style, basic premise, and setting to a higher level of importance than the exact details of Brandon Thomas' \"Charley's Aunt.\" And that appears to have been a good move -- the film is hilarious. As we're in England around the turn of the century, the whole thing becomes a kind of tribute to the entertainment and style of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. And the opening sequence that nearly places its comic star Aleksandr Kalyagin in scenes with Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Max Linder, Harold Lloyd, &c sets the tone perfectly for what is to come -- a wild, almost absurdist ride in the style of the great silent movies of the 1920s and 20s. I've read that the cast and crew were allowed to improvise sequences and work in a party-like atmosphere during filing; that doesn't surprise me as it really seems to come through in the finished product. The performers are uniformly hilarious as well, especially Kalyagin as a supremely unladylike female impersonator and Oleg Shklovksy, who maintains an ever-funner level of complete, infuriated seriousness throughout. But for some reason the one who cracked me up the most was Valentin Gaft as the butler Brasset, who projects an inhumanly high level of deadpan not-giving-a-damn. In short, simply hilarious from good slapstick and frenetic surrealism.",
         "This is one of the best comedies filmed in the USSR. I don't know if it was translated into English, and if it was - I am not sure that translation can relate the whole sense and humor of the comedy... But without any doubt, even if the translation is not very good, you should definitely watch it, it's so funny and brilliant. A lot of lines from this movie are being often cited by Russians - even now, even by those who were not born when \"Hello, I'm your aunt!\" was being filmed. The movie is popular even now. I am a little bit envious you will watch it for the first time.",
         "Due to its script it`s the only Soviet comedy that can be truly appreciated by movie-lovers all over the world. An absolutely fantastic film! The acting by Kalyagin is the best example of cross-dressing comedy in the history of cinema."
