         "BLOOMINGTON Is generally worth avoiding. Jackie is a former child star trying to fit into college. Almost immediately she meets Professor Catherine Stark (McAtee), a sexy psychology professor with a reputation for bedding female undergrads. After a few stolen glances and a single conversation the two crawl between the sheets. I will admit their first kiss was as HOT as any kiss i've ever seen on screen!!! I just did not know where it came from? After the requisite sex scenes and laughing and cooking together and reveling in all the fun they are having, they (you guessed it) fall in love. Watching lesbian movies is like having your girlfriend cook you dinner. No matter what it tastes like you are going to love it because you know how much care and effort she put into it. There is the definite possibility that the green bean casserole she just whipped up is going to be pretty awful. The thing is, every once in a while it isn't half bad. This is how I feel about lesbian movies. I watch them the whole time hoping I don't have to cover my eyes for another embarrassing round of boring plot lines, terrible acting and an endless loop of the one Ani Difranco song the producers could get the rights to. Bloomington starts promisingly but too much of the film is hard to swallow, from the casual way it treats an ethically-questionable sexual relationship between student and teacher to its somewhat anti-climactic ending. It's not the worst lesbian film I've ever seen. but I struggled trying to figure out why this sexy, smoldering, intelligent professor would go after, I'm sorry, a kid.",
         "I was fortunate to be given a DVD screener of this from a friend. At first i thought i was not going to like it one bit as i am more into action movies, but watched it from start to finish and found it to be quite good acting and also quite a good story. I imagined there was going to be something sinister due to the fact that it is a story about a sexual, or lesbian relationship between -teacher and student and was expecting to see a teacher stalking a young student but that does not happen and Jackie (the student) accepts the first kiss in an isolated area of the school grounds quite willingly.From then on the movie evolves mainly focused on the romance that develops between the two of them. Catherine,(the professor) reminded me somewhat of Sharron Stone when she acted in the movie-Basic instinct.I found this to be light hearted and romantic and the only drama was when Jackie decides to return Home and the relationship is threatened.There is no erotica or nude scenes as some would expect with our modern day films. probably not one you would race to the box office over but i found it quite a relaxing watch.",
         "This is a ho-hum movie, born out of a ho-hum script. Much has been said from the other reviewers who draw attention to the lack of realism in the characters, particularly their shifting from emotions so quickly and seemingly without justification to the lack of any chemistry between the leads, the lack of any erotic scenes, and the implausibility in the script. I'm saying I agree. What I object to is not the fact that they are lesbians, or that there is an age difference, but that the entire relationship between teacher and student barely causes a ripple. Sure we've seen those movies before and this isn't the focus of the film, but to not address it in some form is ridiculous. The first time they kiss is in the school grounds in broad daylight? No teacher would do that, no matter what she may have over her superior. There are many other examples of unrealistic situations. The mother character has not been fleshed out properly and jumps from one emotional extreme to the next, literally, in the next sentence. Her daughter Jackie clearly has mother issues, yet this is not explored either, especially in her relationship with Catherine (who at one point cuts up some food for Jackie during dinner like a child). What would possess Catherine to do this? Again, not explained. The couple breaking up is strange, particularly Catherine's attitude. I understand the immediate anger, but her sustained nastiness just doesn't sit right. Finally, I object to society's general hypocrisy when it comes to these types of films. I'm estimating that Jackie is about 17, and the teacher around her mid 30's. If the teacher were male and the student female, he would be deemed a pervert if not a pedophile. Yet here, it's all smooth sailing. You cannot make a film about a teacher having a relationship with a underage student and not address the moral dilemma's involved. To skirt around them insults the viewer. The leads do a competent job, particularly Allison McAtee as Catherine, but she and the LGBT community deserved a better script than this.",
         "I watched Bloomington the other night, and to my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed it! First off, the most refreshing aspect of the film had to be the fact that the lesbian relationship wasn't a huge focus and it wasn't portrayed as being scandalous. Instead, it was just about the relationship between two people in love. I was also extremely pleased with both Sarah Stouffer and Allison McAtee. This is the first film I've seen them in and the two had perfect chemistry and were able to hold their own. This is Stouffer's first film and I think she will be very successful in the future. Moreover, I think the intimate scenes were very tasteful and the scene-transitions were uniquely well done. Now for the spoiler: I really wanted this to be a happy ending . . . in the sense that they stay together. I understand that the relationship helped them both grow as individuals, but my god, I really wanted them to work it out. If anything, I was very happy that they had one last 'encounter' and they ended things on a happy note. My advise, take the time to watch it, it 82 minutes well spent.",
         "Though well intentioned and unobjectionable, Bloomington is undone by a fatal lack of believable conflict. For the most part, this film is as emotionally placid as an inland sea with flashes of hurt feelings and argument jammed in out of nowhere. I didn't sit through the movie just waiting for it to be over. My thoughts were more like \"Okay, where is this thing going?\" Followed after a long while by \"Waitï¿½that's where it was going?\" There are also several stray threads scattered through the story, making it appear as though these filmmakers were never able to take all the ideas in their heads and fully transfer them to the screen. Such an amateurish quality to the storytelling prevents it from fully engaging the viewer, but the very appealing presence of Allison McAtee and an overall feeling of earnest goodwill also keeps it from ever being annoying. Jackie (Sarah Stouffer) is a former child star who's gone away to college. She almost immediately hooks up with the scariest professor on campus, Catherine Stark (Allison McAtee). Though she makes an imperious first impression, Stark turns out to be a solicitous lover and an almost motherly companion to Jackie and they blow through flirting to full blown relationship as quickly as The Flash dons the costume he keeps compressed in his ring. Then Jackie gets an offer to be the lead in a movie version of her old series, which results in Stark turning into a rather large bitch. Jackie doesn't return the favor, but does get all bitchy with her seemingly inoffensive mother. Then Jackie and Stark make up but realize they can't be together. Yeah, that's how it ends. I don't know if writer/director Fernanda Cordoso was unconsciously working out any mother issues with this script, but the way Jackie's relationships with Stark and with her mother flip from sweetness and light to nasty and dark neither fit nor are justified by what's going on in the film. She could merely have realized that her greeting card of a screenplay needed some bite. If that's the case, it comes off like it was all tossed in during a last minute rewrite. Bloomington also has an awful lot of makeout scenes without managing to have one legitimate sex scene. There are a couple of times where it's indicated that someone is doing something below the waist which the viewer can't see, but that's about it. It's odd because the lack of conflict in the story would fit if this were a classy attempt at erotica. The lack of any bare flesh or sensual writhing therefore only draws attention to the paucity of plot. Though Sarah Stouffer is technically playing the main character, Alison McAtee owns this motion picture. Her performance is intelligent, tender and very sexy. Unfortunately, that does make it all the more noticeable when Stark gets pounded down with the Almighty Plot Hammer in the last half of the movie. I can't imagine anyone comes away from Bloomington caring more about Jackie than they do about Stark. And the young woman/older woman lesbian dynamic here is distinctly different from what you'd get with a young woman/older man relationship, giving you something to focus on when the narrative flags. This is a generic coming of age romance. There's been umpteen heterosexual versions of this, so I guess there should be room for a homosexual rendition. Like the straight stuff, though, after you've seen one of these you never really need to watch another.",
         "This movie was very well acted it could of been great if not for the plot and poor ending. There were so many opportunities and different story lines luckily the actresses in the film were not only good looking but good actors. I enjoyed the film a lot but felt too many unanswered questions at it's conclusion. Catherines character was acted so brilliantly and the young Jackie was quite good also. It's been a while since a well acted lesbian interest piece has been released. There could be a comparison made to loving Annabelle but only on the surface both stories are unique in there own way. I hope these actresses come to light again in more films just like this one.",
         "Overall, I enjoyed the movie! Nice story line and it was well put together. Catherine stole the show, but Jackie was also a good character. I really wanted a happier ending and for Catherine to find love; however, with the age difference and career difference it was a predicable ending... Unfortunately the story line of teacher and student just doesn't work out when love comes into play! Hoping there may be a Bloomington 2 just to keep the story going!! I would definitely like to see the relationship continue even though they are at a distance. Maybe Catherine head out to the West Coast even. Loved the movie and I think I will try to catch anything that Allison McAtee is in! She really made the movie worth while.",
         "The movie didn't make sense almost right from the start. The relationship that started almost as soon as Catherine and Jackie met was hot, sure, but I didn't believe it. It's like you meet the characters and then BAM they're together. There was no build up at all and throughout the whole movie, it doesn't really get any better. When they have little arguments, it arises from nothing. They always contradict their actions with their words and vice versa. The characters were beautiful, and I thought they could have made a really good lesbian movie. But unfortunately, I was wrong. I won't be watching this movie again or recommending it to anyone.",
         "the storyline is simple enough; a former child star,jackie who was on a hit sci-fi TV series grows up and decides to leave the show business and pursue an education at a local college where she starts mixing with her peers and getting to live life away from TV sets and other fellow actors. she clearly wants to live a regular life and start doing things on her own terms but gains un-wanted interest, admiration or jealousy of being famous by her her peers. while at a department mixer, she meets and is instantly attracted to psychology professor catherine stark who has a reputation of seducing her students. so it's not much of a surprise when these two start a secret affair. by all accounts, catherine is attentive, giving and caring towards her much younger lover. the two lead actresses had great chemistry and enough sexual tension between them for a believable relationship. while controversial student and teacher relationship have been portrayed on screen before ie. loving annabelle and madchen in uniform, this one is legitimate as both are consenting adults and this does not take place in a boarding/high school. jackie is an adult who has made up her mind to further her education and start living in the real world. i had read reviews where people were disappointed with how the storyline ended since both characters did not end up together. while attending school, jackie is offered an opportunity to reprise her role in the hit TV show that made her famous to the big screen. she is hesitant and un-sure if she is ready to make that step back into the show business as it would clearly change the course of her life and relationship with catherine which at that point is flourishing. i felt the ending to the film was left on a positive note and was realistic. since jackie hasn't identified her sexuality she isn't ready to go public with her relationship with catherine as it could possibly jeopardize and end her future career. this part is brought up in the film during one of the climatic scenes. i really liked the film and thought it was well-paced, directed and excellently acted.",
         "Anyone else see character resemblance between Allison McAtee's 'Catherine Stark' and Sharon Stone's 'Catherine Trammell' in the 1992 sex thriller 'Basic Instinct?' Certainly the two actresses share a physical likeness, but if you ask me, Fernanda Cardoso conjured her Catherine from one of those gauzy sex dreams where you wake up feeling frisky but you can't quite put your finger on why. There were a number of elements in the story which once touched on, were left inadequately developed--like a dream. The aggressive teacher/ingÃ©nue student dynamic was evident and others have mentioned a 'creepy factor' regarding the perceived age difference, when really it's only 10 or 12 years. As Catherine begins to fall for Jackie, she becomes more nurturing, less dominating, more vulnerable, thus the bathing scene/food-cutting/jealousy arc. Professor Stark is clearly used to being the pursuer and chooses her students because of the power she wields over them. As time goes on, you see Catherine's emotional limits begin to crumble as Jackie begins to step back into the Hollywood world where she has the power. The actresses had good chemistry and their scenes together are the strongest but left too much to the viewer's own interpretation. With deeper development of the scenes between them, the emotional intention would have been more clear. The typical 'dyke drama' as revealed in a number scenes, e.g., both of them sleeping with men, Catherine's denial of it being a relationship, their mutual unwillingness to be a public couple, is all rather standard lesbian relationship fare. One true thing is definitely played out--in these May-December romances, the tables invariably are turned and the older partner is the one who gets hurt."
