         "As the all-time biggest fan of Tia and Tamera's 90s show Sister Sister, I've been watching some of their other films together, and this one ranks among their worst. Double Wedding proves to be utterly predictable, which is not necessarily a problem in itself if the cast is likable and the story is pleasant and you actually want it to end the way it looks it's going to. However, Tia and Tamera Mowry have lost all their charm here, meaning that they lost what made Sister Sister work so well for them. There is almost no genuine humor in the movie, and none of the cast is likable. It's so obvious how it's going to turn out that it simply isn't any fun at all. Watch some of the twins' older movies or go back to Sister Sister and enjoy yourself rather than wasting your time with this. * out of ****",
         "a lot of clichés. predictable story. piece from sisters Mowry's show. and two young actors - O.T.Fagbenle and Chad Connell as spices. the theme is not bad but its use is far to be convincing. and that transforms the film in a well-known story about identical twins and the happy end. a film about love more than romance, it has the sin to be only an ordinary comedy, with nothing specific, chaotic in many moments, without the precision for details and with few mistakes who are not the best choice. a film like many, too many others. almost nice with little patience and humor spirit from the viewer. but far to be good or bad or memorable. short - play yard for the sisters Mowry."
