         "Its been a while since I watch a comedy movie from Korea, because I more prefer to their thriller, you know how their thriller right? I feel so excited when I watch this because of its pretty interesting storyline that's no one can ever imagine, I think so. So, what a relief! It doesn't even disappointing me at all, from the start till the end it play with our emotion and make us follow the momentum. Its so good, I love it! Although its ending is quite predictable and can be even better if they reverse it, maybe they just don't want to disappoint their audiences. I still love it! Its been so long since they make a good comedy movie, lately all their comedy product is worst. If you want the real deal! This is it! Sorry for my bad English!",
         "Before seeing a foreign language movie I almost always check the movie rating. If it was any other movie then I would not watch the movie after seeing the rating in IMDb,but when I saw that there is no review available for this movie then it becomes pretty much obvious to watch the movie. Now , the movie itself. It surely is an average movie not a must watch movie. Movie has a interesting story line although the comedy, emotion and serious parts of the movie not quite blend in perfectly. There are some dialogues that will definitely touch your heart. I hate to say all about the movie , because it will ruin it for you if you decide to watch it, Because there is not much to tell. Although the movie could have been much more entertaining,at least it will not bore you to death ;)",
         "I am a huge fan of Korean movies.However comedy(be it any sub genre) is not something you would want to get in too deep coming out from their neck of the woods. Koreans comedies are predominantly cheesy, clichéd,kiddish, frivolous and so on and so forth. This movie for a change is a tad bit different and is not too bad.It starts of brilliantly.It has some really witty humor but you gotta keep your eyes moving. Reading the subtitles becomes strenuous and requires effort after a while which hampers understanding. The dialogues are spoken so fast,sometimes it is hard to keep track of what is going on... the lesser said about this movie the better. A couple, A Casanova, Love!!!!Need i say more 6/10.Watch it if you have to kill time."
