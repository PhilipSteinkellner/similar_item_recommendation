      "synopsis": "A backstage pass, front row seat and intimate look at the fun, glamorous, heartbreaking, inspiring, crazy, magical, passionate, and honest mad diary of Katy Perry. More of a music documentary than a concert video, Katy Perry: Part of Me chronicles Perry's year-long California Dreams World Tour in 2011 with an abundance of personal interviews, film of Perry interacting with her fans, and concert footage from California and around the globe. Absolutely bursting with energy, Perry's a fascinating singer, songwriter, and performer who's faced a fair amount of adversity in her career, and whose upbringing was very different than that of most pop stars. This film plays at times almost like a video diary. Perry philosophizes about everything from growing up in a strictly Pentecostal Christian family to her fairy-tale outlook on life, costuming choices, how her own experiences and emotions influence her lyrics and music, her drive to remain true to herself, and the difficulty of sustaining a long-distance marriage with actor Russell Brand. There's also plenty of footage with Perry's costumers, makeup artists, various assistants, and friends, including actress Shannon Woodward. But some of the most interesting interviews are those with her sister Angela Hudson, who travels with show, and her mother and father regarding their commitment to accepting and supporting Perry and her career despite potential conflicts with their religious views. One discussion that's oddly omitted is any hint of why Perry changed her name. While the personal and backstage footage is heartfelt and quite intriguing, the film seemed somewhat lacking in actual concert footage, though viewers are treated to at least parts of \"Firework,\" \"California Gurls,\" \"Part of Me,\" \"Last Friday Night,\" and \"Peacock.\"",

         "If you go into this movie as a fan of Katy Perry, you'll love it. If you don't like her at all, you won't like the movie. Plain and simple. As a fan of Katy Perry, I juggled with the idea of actually paying money to see this in the theater because I wouldn't say I'm a hardcore fan. But I decided I would go to experience the 3D effects. The 3D did not disappoint. It added a dimension to some of the concert scenes making the atmosphere fun and bubbly. The concert scenes were mixed in with behind the scenes looks at what goes into being Katy Perry. Now if you are not a huge fan of her, you probably won't want to see the movie. It does give a really personal and at times, tragic, look into super stardom. And at the end of the movie you might find yourself liking Katy more. Overall, it really is a film for fans. Nothing more, nothing less.",
         "There are some very miserable spiteful reviews on here. They usually contain such revelations as 'I don't like Katy Perry's music and hated this movie'. Er... what are you doing watching a film about Katy Perry if you don't like Katy Perry's music. I know, you came to be bored and to dislike it and you succeeded. The film contains a very revealing and surprising story about a genuinely gifted songwriter breaking out of her strict religious upbringing and rising to the very highest peak that anybody could possibly wish for. She did it through shear determination and spirit. She did not get it handed to her. She was in fact jerked around by all the record companies and almost sunk until, in one memorable quote, one of the young female execs stole her music from the company and 'snuck out' with it, so that she would be free to find success at another label which had people of some imagination and vision instead of the lame egotistical dicks that she was tied to at that time. Her message is absolutely positive, absolutely empowering and liberating for young girls, and the concert footage shows just how transcendent that message becomes for them at the live shows. She is not sleazy or nasty or stupid. If I had a daughter I would strongly approve of her being a 'Katy cat'. I enjoyed every minute of this documentary. Those who hated it are most likely sad old men or jealous bitches. I reckon.",
         "If you don't like Katy Perry then don't go and see this film. If you've never heard of her, then here is a quick heads up about her and about this (self-produced) movie. After kicking away from a very religious upbringing (while retaining her faith), and paying some serious dues, Perry hit it big with the self-aware and mildly salacious single I Kissed A Girl and the excellent album it came from, One Of The Boys. More hits followed as Perry worked her little Minnie Mouse strawberry flavoured socks off touring the album across the world in a series of relatively small gigs. The second album (discounting an Unplugged fill-in), Teenage Dream, enjoyed massive success and spawned 5 (and counting) major hit singles. Perry toured this album with a major stadium worldwide tour throughout 2011 featuring a two hour show laden with dancers, costumes, effects and so on. 3D footage of tour performance forms the backbone of this film as it tells Perry's backstory and also provides backstage footage of the tour and also the disintegration of her relatively brief marriage to bad boy comedian Russell Brand. Despite being a 60 year old Englishman with two grown kids - hardly part of the Perry demographic, and certainly not one of her \"KatyCats\" - I have a lot of time for Miss Perry. If nothing else, she is a grafter, and I respect that highly. She is also a strong individualist with a huge sense of fun as regards style and presentation. Her songs are melodic and often lyrically witty and saucy (though with a regrettable leaning towards crassness in places on the more recent album). Her vocal style, while limited to essentially a full-throated pop blare or else falsetto, suits her material. The concert footage - all of it interrupted by cutaways and voiceovers - made me wish that a full 3D concert movie was available. I enjoyed it, but was enormously frustrated at not being able to experience a single number all the way through. The non-concert footage is interesting (and one must bear in mind that the edit was almost certainly under Perry's complete control). I was already aware of most of the personal history, but it was interesting to meet family and friends and to understand that she has a strong support structure in place. The scale of the more recent tour was impressive, and it was good to see her enthusiastic interaction with her fans, especially the young ones: not all acts are as available, even if only in rationed doses. Also interesting and moving were the sequences shot around the marriage breakdown. Kudos to Perry for including them (I contrast this with Paul McCartney's concert DVD immediately preceding his marriage breakup, where Heather Mills has been edited out completely, while she is all over the previous one). These sequences don't take sides, they simply present a glimpse of the impact on Perry towards the end of a major tour, and her professionalism in the face of difficult personal circumstances. I suspect that the best stage performances feature a considered performance persona - a \"stage face\", if you like - fuelled by talent and part of the personality of the real person behind the mask. Sometimes the two meet, and the audience sees the real person through the stage mask: that is magic, and it happens here. A film which started out having me go \"Oh dear\" at the gushing tributes from young fans left me with increased respect for Perry, and the feeling that maybe she's not a bad role model for impressionable young girls.",
         "IF you're a fan of US singer Katy Perry, you'll love this autobiographical concert movie of her songs and life. If you don't know anything about her, you'll still enjoy the movie as it follows the structure of these kind of movies: it has many concert performances and interviews with her family, friends and fans about what a great singer and person she is. The movie follows her on a year-long tour last year to promote her album, which produced five No. 1 hits, the first for a female artiste. The movie would have been a normal one but for the way it milks her divorce from British comedian Russell Brand for all it's worth. Brand filed for divorce in December 2011 after 14 months of marriage. It shows what led to the divorce (him wanting to have a baby; she not being interested in becoming a mum now) and then her finally accepting the divorce, complete with a breakdown, just before the start of her concert in Sao Paolo, Brazil. She even contemplates cancelling the concert. This will certainly brings tears to many, as it did to me. I enjoyed her concert shows as they were vibrant, energetic and colourful. \"Thank you for accepting my weirdness,\" she tells the camera and her fans. Her niceness permeates the movie, and you can see why her mostly white fans adore her, dress like her, mime her lyrics and say how much she inspires them and gives them hope. ** www.jeffleemovies.com (FB and Twitter)",
         "Yeah, I actually took the time to watch this. It's exactly what you would expect. It's simply another touring concert movie to cash in on the success of a modern icon, but at least we do get to see why people look up to Katy Perry in such a way. Is it her music? Okay, but lots of artists have good music. Is it her fashion? I don't think that's it either. I think people look up to Perry because her personality is just so likable, and she's faced relatable issues and real life problems, all of that leading to where she is now. Maybe the movie makes her a little too likable, but you can see exactly why she's considered such a role model, and any fan of her music (guilty) will enjoy hearing the live performances of her songs. *** / *****",
         "There have been tons of concert movies that have come out, but unless you're a fan they really have a limited audience. With the latest Katy Perry: Part of Me they do something a bit different than just deliver another concert film, but instead an inside look at the creation and execution of Perry's tour, but also a documentary aspect telling about her career and personal victories and heartaches throughout. What's good about this film is that you don't have to be a fan of her music to find it interesting. On one side you get the Behind the Music vibe of her career wrapped in a big bow of making of the concert, sprinkled with numerous performances of her on stage. While all this is entertaining in itself, what really takes this film outside of the norm is the closer look at her personal life and emotions that she deals with while struggling to deal with life, marriage, and an unbelievable tour schedule. Here they never shy away from showing her raw moments of breaking down from pushing herself just as much as the glamour and fun of her seemingly magical world she has created around her. It's refreshing to see a star of her caliber that feels like a down to earth girl who made it big time and now just happens to be one of the biggest stars in the world. Of course there will be those that think some of it is just playing to the camera and who knows, but really who cares. The entire vibe she has created seems to bring more happiness to the world and her fans and seeing the amount of work and actual creative control she has it really impressive for someone still so young. Like her music or not, this film is so much more than that. This is a behind the scenes look at the side of music you don't see very often. Every star has their ways of doing things, but here seeing what Perry, and obviously many others like her go through both personally and physically to deliver what the fans clamor for should give you a new respect for both her and the performers in general. What's really crazy is that you can't help but enjoy this movie due to the simple fact that it exhumes joy on every level. It's like you fell off a cloud into a real life candy land and will bring a smile to your face. http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey",
         "Alright so I seen this in the cinemas last year with my brother and my mom. Of course we ended up watching this unannounced because the film that we were suppose to watch was on too late and we couldn't stay to watch it (BTW the film we were suppose to see was ICE AGE 4) but instead I said to my mom how about Katy Perry's concert movie. She agreed and we went in to see it. Surprisingly I actually found myself liking it. Heck I even bought it on DVD after that and I only seen it once(BTW its not a movie you'd watch over and over again,only now and again as its a documentary). So what is it about,well the movie is a music documentary like I mentioned before about Katy Perry's life and what she does on a day to day basis touring around the world with her band and also learning her past mistakes when she married Russell Brand(whom she broke up with and you can actually see her breaking down in tears because of it. Also we get to see her 90 something year old grandmother,her parents,AND her brother and sister.Before the movie even starts we get to see some of Katy Perry's biggest fans and all her fun costumes that she wears. Katy Perry herself seemed to be a really nice sweet down to earth young woman who knows how to please people,even my mom said that she was a really plain down to earth chick and my 5 year old brother(who was 4 at the time)also liked it(and hey it was his first PG movie so he might fancy her who knows right). So onto my final verdict. If your a Katy Perry fan and you grew up listening to her music and just like her in general than go and see it,if you are looking for a movie based film where someone is acting like Katy Perry then avoid and also if you hate real life films than avoid it. Overall I'm giving this a 7.",
         "I have perhaps an unusual way of picking movies to watch on DVD, I get whatever my public library buys. This Katy Perry movie is one of them. I sort of put off watching it, until the day before it was due, because I didn't really expect to like it. What a surprise! I really like this documentary movie. It mostly focuses on the year-long world tour to publicize her music and her most recent album. But it also has a lot of 'behind-the-scene' stuff, and includes some family history and the early religious singing she did as a teen. Before I saw this movie my main source of information on her came from her highly publicized quick romance with British actor Russell Brand. The fact that they were on the verge of splitting up, which actually began near the end of the film, adds to the realism of the whole situation. I came away liking Katy Perry a lot, even though she somewhat of a task-mistress, in control of her tour, she also comes across as a gentle and kind person, who sees good in life and in other people. Perhaps it is because she is such a romantic, that she gave her heart so easily. Some of the most touching scenes are her interacting with young fans, some of them with very serious illnesses. Also, a bonus for me was Shannon Woodward, an actress I admire from her role as 'Sabrina' in the TV series 'Raising Hope.' I learned she has been 'best friends' with Katy Perry for a long time, and they are seen together here in some of the video. Also a key participant in the tour and the film is Katy's older sister, and it is easy to see that they are sisters. All-in-all a fine movie, to me much better than its IMDb rating would indicate. I am now a Katy Perry fan, of the person, not necessarily the music.",
         "That documentary is not what I expected. It was trying to make us feel sorry for the 'difficulties' that Katy has experienced in her life and then it talks about the success. I have to say that I AM a fan of Katy, I do like what she does, but, with this, she made me think differently of her. I hated the first part, when the critics were judging on Katy comparing it with other artists, such as Rihanna and Lady Gaga, and, above all, they were trying to state that Katy is better than them, by revealing some hateful points, which are not true at all. I thought it would be more of the 'behind the scenes' stuff and emotions, or even some sort of previously unknown things, but I was wrong, they were speaking of Katy in such a way that seemed totally flat. They were mentioning things that we already know, general things. By the way, the introduction was so long. Over all I would say that this documentary, a desperate way of winning more money, is not worth seeing, don't spend your money in that way. You better skip it! Believe me, it'll do you wrong!",
         "\"Thank you all for believing in my weirdness,\" a perky, heavily dolled-up Perry states to her rambunctious audience in her self-titled documentary, Katy Perry: Part of Me, arguably the best concert film I've seen since Michael Jackson's This Is It. When I say \"concert film,\" be advised I am using it in its loosest form. Perry is shown as a compassionate, self-aware, completely genuine enigma throughout the picture and the compilation of concert clips have some of the most impressive theatricalities I've seen in recent times. To put it simply, the set designs as a whole look as if Willy Wonka was the hired contractor. Perry exploded into the mainstream scene in 2008 when her song \"I Kissed a Girl\" burst onto peoples' radios, playing the infectious pop instrumentals which were equipped with \"good girl gone bad\" style lyrics. It was a fun little jam that you wanted to hear again instantly after it was done. Prior to the breakthrough of her single, Perry was attempting to get recognition with her gospel songs and her acoustic guitar. Despite being raised with extreme Christian theology by her parents, she realized that it most likely wasn't going to get her broad recognition in the music industry. She needed to do something catchy, fun, and slightly provocative. Her \"debut album\" (second to only a gospel rock one released seven years prior), One of the Boys, was released the same year and welcomed over one million sales, making Perry, officially, one of the most successful new artists in 2008. But she wasn't done. She had a plethora of quirkiness to show her new fans. Then came Teenage Dream, another record breaking album boasting five number one hits, including \"California Gurls\", \"Teenage Dream\", \"Firework\", \"E.T.\", \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\", and \"Part of Me\" - a record previously held by only Michael Jackson. For a while, it was impossible to turn on a radio for more then ten minutes and not hear one of these songs. Part of Me centers itself around Perry's stage shows, but isn't hesitant to dig into her personal life to get a deeper look at the perky woman herself. We see her acting unusually graceful to her assistants, costume designers, managers, etc (I was reminded of the way Conan O'Brien treated his management team in Conan O'Brien Can't Stop and how disrespectful he was most of the time), and there are times we see her without any makeup on - a complete rarity in many documentaries showcasing an idolized talent. Seeing Perry interact with her fans is a charming, often uplifting event that brings a smile to not only the fan's faces but also ours. We see Perry in touch with her fanbase because, as we're told from the start, \"she knows what it's like to be that girl in the audience.\" Even the gooey, often cheesy scenes where we see crazed fans do an amateur rendition of one of her songs we can't help but crack a loose smile. We think of the woman's ingenuity and spirit which clearly rubs off on her extensive line of fans. But unfortunately, tragedy brews, and we are not robbed of scenes of Perry crying, lying around, or simply, broken-hearted. We see her deeply affected by her divorce with Russell Brand. We can see love still reigns in her eyes, but the relationship is sadly, a toxic area for the both of them. They are scarcely seen together in the documentary, and because of conflicting schedules, which the film tactfully makes note of, we can assume this is a contributing reason to the breakup. This is where most concert documentaries would ham up the sad music, show a star in distress, only to have them brush away the tears and continue on within the next few minutes. We saw it in Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, but Katy Perry: Part of Me dares to humanize an artist victim to a heavy schedule and a majority of problems the people and the media tend to scrutinize or simplify beyond comprehension. My number one complaint with movies of this kind is that, most of the time, they serve little to no purpose. Bieber's documentary and Kenny Chesney: Summer in 3D provided some nice music and pleasant visuals, but the whole thing felt like a vehicle, incomplete and victim to unusual timing. If they are filmed nicely, offer insights, properly depict the artist at hand, and try to branch out to others and not conform to the ones firmly gridlocked in the fanbase, I will throw the bone. The bone has been thrown to Katy Perry: Part of Me. Starring: Katy Perry. Directed by: Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz."
