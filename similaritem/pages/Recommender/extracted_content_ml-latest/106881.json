         "There are ways for women to overcome their physical inferiority to men. The heroine of this film, played by January Jones, somehow learns it, and carries out her plans with a vengeance. The film later becomes an absurd but fun ride like \"Red Eye\" with its female lead replaced by another pretty blond, and set in the spectacular backdrop of the wild, wild New Mexico. Jones is clearly not gunning for major awards here, and striking deep emotions is apparently not a requirement for her part. She needs to look sassy and resolute in her cute costume, and she sufficiently delivers within that realm. Ed Harris is fantastic as a lunatic sheriff. The performances by the rest of the supporting cast are also sound, especially by Jason Isaacs. Country music heartthrob Jason Aldean is naturally menacing as the bad guy's right hand man. He has a reasonable shot at a moonlighting career in movies of this genre outside his day job as a singer. \"Sweetwater\" will surely rub old school Western fans the wrong way, but if you are open-minded about crossing formats, you just might find this popcorn Western a perfect pastime.",
         "\"The Lord does not believe in actions without consequences.\" The New Mexico territory in the late 1800's is full of danger. When Sarah, a young wife (Jones) encounters the local preacher (Isaacs) and a sheriff (Harris) who isn't totally sane. When she refuses the preacher's advances her life is forever changed. Now with the help of the sheriff she sets out for revenge, and you know what they say about a woman scorned. I am a huge Ed Harris fan and I like westerns but lately the genre has been in a huge nose dive so I wasn't sure what to expect from this. This is easily one of the better ones that have come out lately but it is still a little slow moving. 90% of the reason this is good is the cast. Harris is good in everything, Isaacs is the most disturbing preacher since Michael Parks played one in Red State. The gem of the movie though is January Jones. For once she isn't just the eye candy of the movie, she actually has a needed part and the fact that it is her that loses it and goes on a killing spree makes it that much more interesting. If you are a western fan this is one to watch. Don't expect something like Open Range though, this is more like Appaloosa or 3:10 To Yuma or for you real movie fiends out there, if you liked Seraphim Falls you will like this. Overall, started off slow but really picked up and by the end you are glad you watched it. One of the better westerns in the last few years. I give it a B.",
         "In 1880s New Mexico, self-declared prophet Josiah (Jason Isaacs) is building a church on \"God's land.\" Unfortunately, \"God's land\" is also inhabited by a farming couple, Miguel (Eduardo Noriega) and Sarah (January Jones), whose attempts to grow crops keep being stymied by Josiah's free-roaming flock of sheep. At the same time, two brothers who happen to be related to the Governor have gone missing, and it seems to lawman Sheriff Jackson (Ed Harris) that they must have disappeared right in the middle of Josiah's spread. The meeting and interactions between these characters will bring out their respective histories, misdemeanors and other crimes, and it's anyone's guess who might live to tell the tale.... Although I don't generally like Westerns, I was very impressed at FantAsia 2011 by \"Blackthorn,\" in which Sam Shepard plays an aging Butch Cassidy (and Eduardo Noriega has a feature role, as in \"Sweetwater\"); I thought for sure Shepard would get lots of acting awards once the film played in wide release, but I don't think it ever got a wide release. Fearful of missing another great Western by assuming it would be in regular theatres any day, I made sure to catch \"Sweetwater\" this year and I'm glad I did! Ed Harris is amazing as the very eccentric, borderline crazy sheriff and Jason Isaacs is incredibly chilling as the definitely way-over-the-border psychotic preacher. But January Jones was just electric here; sure she looks gorgeous and makes most of the male characters drool, but she's thoroughly independent and absolutely fearless when she decides to take matters into her own hands. The landscape is breath-taking (and will make you thirsty just looking at it) and the story-telling is marvelous. I hope this has a better fate than \"Blackthorn,\" because it deserves to be seen even by those, like me, who don't tend to like Westerns.",
         "Just finished watching Sweetwater at the Sundance. Great audience reception! I think we were ready for a renewal of the western, an action packed morality play in an otherwise overly-intellectual festival. January Jones plays Sara, the prostitute turned good housewife. After his husband is killed by maniac prophet Josiah (Jason Isaacs, in role tailor made for his cold features) she goes on a cleaning spree a-la-Dirty Harry. And does she clean up shop! All the bad guys get what they had coming, and in the wild west the only penalty for misbehaving is lead. She does a very credible job as an avenging angel with a cute face and a purple umbrella. A highly entertaining film, with few good guys but a satisfying morality tale. Ed Harris is a treat as an anachronic elder flower child of the 1970's. I wished to see Sara and Sheriff Jackson ride into the sunset, and meet again in a later film. Overall a highly recommended movie.",
         "As far as contemporary western goes, this one is very good. The obvious influence of There will be Blood and Terrence Malick can be annoying, especially in the opening sequences. But then the film find is own identity in a very dark, even macabre, humor and a very nihilistic view of human nature. It give some real piece of anthology, as when the pastor wake up to find the sheriff sitting at his kitchen table with two dead bodies he just digged out; or when Sarah shot a voyeuristic shop owner up the ass. The plot, as the title points out, is one of revenge, but it is not that important. Obviously, the director is more interested in characters and actors then storytelling. All the actors are fantastic, and are allowed to give creative, over the top performances. The result is both fun and unsettling to watch, even if it is sometime frustrating.",
         "First, this has been released under the title \"Sweet Vengeance\"....classic western genera..if you liked Open Range, (Kostner, Duval, et al) you'll like this. January Jones plays the \"lifeless\" whore trying to make a life on the hard scrabble of New Mexico. There is not much left that is going to get an emotional rise out of her, except her lover, there she is alive. She has probably seen it all and now has found someone to love and try and make a life with. Ed Harris, lawman, tracking down two lost brothers is almost a perfect 10, the rest of the supporting cast is excellent. It is well worth the watch.",
         "Ed Harris is having a great time and the viewer shares that enjoyment in this fantastic western. For those who long for a return of \"Deadwood\" this film should ease your withdrawals for a short time. The cast is uniformly excellent, the cinematography is wonderful and the writing is great. The only shortcoming, for those who like their westerns with a dose of spaghetti, is the soundtrack music. Bloody, violent and lots of fun. Ed Harris deserves much praise. The bleakness of the landscape is quite realistic. You can almost taste the dust and dirt in the air. Much of the secondary cast is also made up of very talented actors. A must watch for fans of true westerns.",
         "Spoiler contained in review. Enjoyed movie. The performances were excellent. A checklist for a proper revenge movie. And the last part of the movie, when you're thinking \"no, don't turn your back\", she finalizes the movie with a \"that's what I would do!\" moment. Could watch it again now. I too was at Sundance, but have a different take on the audience than that of mikefine-1, they enjoyed it. The audience in general was filled with motivated movie goers, and they cheered and agreed with the extermination of the mindless followers of evil, the pervert, the corrupt lawman, and the greedy banker. Not going to win an academy award, worth the time to watch.",
         "This western is good because it has simple details of everyday menial experiences brought into magnified observation like the Coen Brothers and Quentin Tarentino incorporate into their films that people personally identify with. Very good writing and directing. The character behavior is realistic for the period with a unique cast of established actors that have a track record of rolls in unusual movies similar to No Country for Old Men. January Jones, Ed Harris, and Mr. Root, the judge, from Justified, add the quirky features you will find worth your time. This is a no-nonsense simple story of detective work with refreshing deviance from stupid Hollywood fare.",
         "Sophomore helmer Logan Miller's frontier tale of vengeance \"Sweetwater\" is a solid but savage horse opera that doesn't bite off more than its low-budget can chew. Basically, this Arc Entertainment oater concerns revenge that a young wife exacts when she discovers that a malevolent minister has slain her husband in cold blood. January Jones plays Sarah Ramírez, and she is an exceptional marksman, far better than her spouse. During one scene when they are shooting at targets, Sarah out-shoots him. Before she married her husband Miguel (Eduardo Noriega of \"The Last Stand\"), she was a painted lady like her mother, Madame Bovary (Amy Madigan of \"Streets of Fire\"), who raised her to ply the same trade. Although neither Logan Miller nor his twin brother scenarist Noah Miller explain how Sarah wound up wedding Miguel, Sarah and her husband borrow money from a lowdown local banker, Hugh (Stephen Root of \"Red State\"), to buy land and build themselves a house. Nearby resides a hypocritical Morman, the Prophet Josiah (Jason Isaacs of \"Green Zone\"), who has two wives, a daughter, and several ranch hands who have followed him from Utah. The Prophet raises sheep. The symbolism is rather obvious but nevertheless apt. One day, the Prophet catches two trespassers on his land who have killed one of his flock and cooked it. Levi (Logan Miller) and Jacob (Noah Miller) are brothers. Levi's wife is related to the Territorial Governor so when they disappear without a trace, the chief executive dispatches Sheriff Jackson (Ed Harris of \"Appaloosa\") to find them. Mind you, Harris doesn't play this western lawman with the usual stoic quality with which lawmen are usually depicted. Instead, Jackson is extremely eccentric, if not a little touched in the head. He conducts his investigation and learns that the man who killed Noah shot him with a homemade bullet that contained zinc. The crazy Jackson brings the corpses to Josiah's house and thoroughly enrages him. What Jackson eventually learns is that Josiah murdered not only Levi and Noah, but also that he killed Miquel. After he killed Miquel, Josiah raped Sarah. Life has been rather tough on Sarah. After Miquel disappears, she loses her baby before she could deliver it. Sarah sets out to punish Miquel's killer. Single-handedly, she tracks down all Josiah's men as well as his confederates and guns them down. He gives the man who runs the general merchandise store a lead suppository after she catches him in the act of masturbating while peering through a hole in the wall of his customer's dressing room. Earlier, the storekeeper admired Sarah's form until she poked him in the eye with an umbrella. When Sarah rides out for revenge, she has dressed herself up as a prostitute again. Inspite of its low budget, \"Sweetwater\" is a handsome looking western with substantial production values. The characters are memorable and vivid, particularly Harris' looney sheriff and Isaacs' crazy prophet. \"Avengers\" lenser Brad Shield has photographed this entertaining but offbeat distaff western so you can feel the dust, sweat, and violence. Logan doesn't let any grass grow under his feet. Clocking in at 95 minutes, \"Sweetwater\" qualifies as an above-average sagebrusher. If you love to watch women toting guns and shooting at men, \"Sweetwater\" is ideal fare for you."
