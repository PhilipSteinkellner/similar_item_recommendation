      "synopsis": "In Egypt, Yousef Bey ( John Carradine) journeys to a remote temple in answer to a summons from Andoheb, High Priest of Arkham ( George Zucco). Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis ( Lon Chaney Jr.). 3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning ( Dick Foran), leader of the expedition. The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman ( Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research. After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey ( Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori ( Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind. Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt. Yousef Bey then pledges his devotion: \"I swear by the mighty power of Amon-Ra, whose anger can shatter the world and by the dread horror of Set, that I shall never forsake my trust as a Priest of Arkham. Nor shall I rest until the Princess Ananka and Kharis are safe once more in the Hills of Arkham.\" Andoheb explains that each night during the cycle of the full moon, Yousef Bey is to brew the fluid from 9 tana leaves and that wherever Kharis is, the Mummy will sense this and find the leaves. The moon is full in Mapleton as Professor Norman studies the hieroglyphics on the case of tana leaves. He has deciphered the message about brewing 9 tana leaves during the full moon and decides to do just that. The battered, ragged form of Kharis now appears, his right arm is useless and held in a sling, his right eye burned and sealed shut. He senses the leaves brewing and begins instinctively heading toward them. On the way, he passes the home of Amina and his presence arouses her from a fitful sleep. She wanders outside in a trance-like state. She does not see Kharis, who is now some distance ahead, but somehow follows the same course. Kharis soon arrives at the home of Professor Norman and enters his study. Norman looks up and is shocked to see the Mummy shambling toward him with one arm extending, reaching for the Professor's throat. Soundlessly and brutally, Kharis strangles Norman and then drinks the fluid of the tana leaves. Amina now approaches and Kharis senses her presence and heads back outside. From a concealed location, Amina sees Kharis, which snaps her out of her trance but also causes her to immediately faint. She falls to the ground with a strange birthmark now apparent on her wrist. The next morning, Tom Hervey learns that Professor Norman was murdered and that Amina was found at the scene and detained. He immediately heads for the Professor's home. At the home, Sherriff Elwood ( Harry Shannon) and the Coroner ( Emmett Vogan) investigate the scene of the crime. They discover a strange mold around the Professor's throat; a sign they both know to mean that the Mummy stalks Mapleton again. The Sherrif questions Amina, who has developed a white streak in her hair overnight. Amina is dazed and confused, but Elwood continues to grill her until Hervey arrives. Tom unsuccessfully tries to provide an alibi for Amina and the Sherrif maintains his suspicions in her involvement. Elwood finally dismisses the pair but gives Amina the obligatory warning not to leave the area. Tom takes her home to comfort her but is himself disturbed by the changes in her appearance. Panic begins to grip the town as newspaper reports of the killing highlight the involvement of the Egyptian woman and the speculation that the Mummy has returned. Townspeople are warned to stay indoors at night and all able-bodied men are asked to help patrol the streets after dark. Weeks later Yousef Bey, who has arrived in Mapleton, calls on Amon-Ra to aid him in his quest and begins to brew the sacred fluid of the tana leaves to summon Kharis. Kharis, indeed, senses the leaves and heads toward them. Tom and Amina are out for a drive that same night. Amina is finally beginning to return to normal, laughing and no longer hearing voices or suffering from fevers and chills. Unseen, Kharis passes near them, causing Amina's mood to suddenly change and for her to feel an unnatural cold. Despite Tom professing his love for her, Amina cannot shake the strange feeling and asks to be taken home. Kharis continues on his quest for the tana leaves, passing through the Evans farm. The family dog is startled by his presence and begins to bark incessantly. Mr. Evans ( Eddy Waller), armed with a shot gun, comes out of the house to investigate and is surprised by Kharis. Evans fires his weapon at the Mummy to no avail. Kharis swiftly murders the man and busts through the wall of the barn, undeterred from his quest. The Sherrif soon arrives on the scene and, recognizing the evidence of Kharis, plans to organize a search party. Kharis, meanwhile, finds Yousef Bey and consumes the life-giving tana leaves. Yousef thanks his god for his success thus far and re-pledges his devotion to their mission. The next day, at the Scripps Museum, Yousef Bey lags behind a tour group viewing the Mummy of Ananka. He asks Amon-Ra for forgiveness for allowing these heretics to view the sacred remains of the Princess. After closing time, Yousef emerges from a hiding place as Kharis breaks into the museum. The two are excited with anticipation as their mission appears near an end. Yousef encourages Kharis by telling him the Tombs of Arkham are waiting to claim their own. Kharis attempts to touch the mummified body, but it disintegrates under the wrapping as his hand approaches. At that same moment, Amina, miles away in her home, awakens screaming. Yousef Bey realizes that Ananka's soul has been re-incarnated into another form. Kharis is enraged and begins destroying the exhibit, attracting the museum security guard ( Oscar O'Shea). The guard enters, not seeing Kharis, and draws his gun on the High Priest. The Mummy exits the shadows and moves toward the horrified man. He fires several shot at point blank range, but the Mummy is not even slowed. Kharis crushes his throat as Yousef Bey looks on with glee. Yousef Bey realizes that the two must still fulfill their mission and find the new vessel holding Ananka's soul and return it to Egypt. Tom Hervey visits Sherrif Elwood, seeking permission to take Amina away to New York to restore her health. Elwood says he is not trying to implicate Amina in the murders, but denies Hervey's request. At the Scripps Museum, the body of the guard is found and the tell-tale marks of mold identify the killer as Kharis. Police Inspector Walgreen ( Barton MacLane) and Dr. Ayad ( Lester Sharpe) from the museum are bewildered as to how Ananka's body has disappeared without disturbing the wrappings. Dr. Ayad translates the markings on the tomb for the Inspector: \"Herein rests the body of Ananka, third daughter of Amenophis. In the Hills of Arkham shall Ananka lie in the tomb appointed for her and in none other, because freed from its resting place, her soul may find reincarnation in another form, again to seek out its salvation on earth.\" The Inspector is skeptical but asks the Doctor to accompany him to Mapleton to investigate further. Upon arriving, they seek out the assistance of Sherrif Elwood and the group convenes at the home of the late Professor Norman. Dr. Ayad translates most of the markings on the cask of tana leaves and Inspector Walgreen decides to use the leaves to attract and capture Kharis. Since bullets are useless against the Mummy, the plan is to build a pit to confine the creature until a way to deal with him can be found. Amina is still unable to shake the haunted feelings that torture her. Tom, disregarding the Sherrif's warnings, asks Amina to elope with him to New York. Amina tries to discourage him but Tom is insistent. She agrees and the two make plans to leave early the next morning. Tom leaves Amina in the care of her guardian, Mrs. Blake ( Dorothy Vaughan) and Tom's faithful dog, Peanuts. Yousef Bey calls upon Amon Ra to lead him to the new home of Ananka's soul. Just then, a window blows open and Yousef sees the moon, which resembles the scene on the ceremonial amulet he wears as a Priest of Arkham. Knowing that this is a sign from the gods, he sends Kharis in that direction to find Ananka. Using the widowed Mrs. Norman's ( Claire Whitney) recollections as a guide, Inspector Walgreen now begins to bait his trap by burning nine tana leaves. Kharis immediately senses this, and heads toward the Norman home--a course that takes him directly past Amina's home. Amina is awakened by his approach and hypnotically wanders into the yard. Kharis sees her and recognizes her as the carrier of Ananka's soul. Amina faints as Kharis picks her up and takes her away. The abduction is witnessed by Mrs. Blake, who phones Tom to alert him. Tom immediately sets out in pursuit. Mrs. Blake, then heads to the Norman house and tells her story to Inspector Walgreen, Sherrif Elwood and a large group of volunteers. A frantic chase now ensues. Kharis and Amina are headed for the old mill where Yousef Bey waits. Tom, led by Peanuts, is hot on their trail, while further back is the mob. Kharis arrives at the mill and presents Amina to Yousef Bey. Bey recognizes the birthmark on her wrist as the symbol of the Priests of Arkham. Amina awakens and the Priest informs her that she is, indeed, the reincarnation of Ananka. Amina denies this but Yousef Bey warns her: \"For those who defy the will of the ancient gods, a cruel and violent death shall be their fate, never shall they find rest unto eternity.\" Yousef Bey now begins to admire Amina's beauty and feels the pangs of temptation to keep her alive as his bride. His devotion begins to falter as they are thousands of miles from the Tombs of Arkham and Ananka is thousands of years from her sin. He calls upon Isis to protect him in his hour of temptation, but his prayers go unanswered. He decides to use the tana leaves to keep Amina young and beautiful forever. The two will drink the fluid and become immortal and never return to Egypt. This enrages Kharis and before Yousef Bey can give her the fluid, the Mummy knocks the cup away. He exacts his vengeance on the Priest with a killing blow, delivered with enough force to fling Yousef's lifeless body through the window and onto the ground below. Tom Hervey now arrives and witnesses the death of the Priest. He rushes up the stairs to the mill but is met by Kharis. A struggle ensues and Tom is quickly overwhelmed. Kharis returns to retrieve Amina, whose hair is now completely white. The mob now approaches and they revive Tom, as Kharis attempts to escape with Amina. Once again led by Peanuts, the mob pursues the Mummy and his Princess into the neary swamps. In Kharis's arms, Amina/Ananka is now aging rapidly. They are chased deeper and deeper into the swamps and now begin to sink into the bog. Tom's last anguished sight of Amina is that of a 3,000 year old Egyptian Princess. Kharis and Ananka disappear under the water, united in death.",

         "\"The Mummy's Ghost\" is haunting and unforgettable thanks to the appearance of probably the most ravishing starlet to ever grace the screen: Ramsey Ames. She portrays the doomed Princess Ananka/Amina Monsouri heroine with a brooding, tremulous quality and when she sinks into the quicksand at the end with the mummy, you're shocked by watching her age into a 1000 mummy's bride. John Carradine is in great form as the high priest of arkham. Robert Lowery is unusually surly as the boyfriend. Reginald LeBorg directed this l944 classic. He originally wanted Acquanetta as the heroine but this sultry starlet fell and injured her shoulder on the first day of shooting. Ames was criminally ill-used by Universal but looked great in a short bob for the Republic serial, \"G-Men Never Forget\" in l947. Before she died two years ago from throat cancer, she remembered that Lon Chaney, who played the mummy, created many problems but she wouldn't specify. Other reports have it that Chaney was usually drunk by 12 noon. Ames was terrified he would stumble with her on the long, steep boardwalk to the remote shed and also into the swamp.wonderful atmosphere, classic musical scoring (originally from \"Son of Frankenstein). Vera West does brilliant job in designing Ames beautiful white silk gowns.",
         "Despite the increasingly familiar nature of these Mummy sequels, this one still has enough to make it brisk and enjoyable. A significant boost is added in casting John Carradine as the newest high priest, who keeps Kharis fed and back on the march - this time with a new angle in trying to reunite the mummy with his princess Ananka, now reincarnated into the form of a sexy modern woman (Ramsay Ames). For some reason, Lon Chaney thankfully invests some character into Kharis this time, allowing him to become angered, frustrated, and even saddened during the course of the movie. The biggest drawback for this chapter is that Robert Lowery and Ramsay Ames are pretty lousy as the two leading lovers. Universal stock music is used to great effect in many sequences, and there is an offbeat ending that may be the best one of the series. *** out of ****",
         "This horror yarn gives new meaning to term \" 'til death do us part.\" This was a real quickie movie and it shows. However, it's one redeeming value is the mummy finally wins the girl, albeit, it may leave one with that sinking feeling.",
         "MORD39 RATING: **1/2 (of ****) This third film in the \"Kharis\" series is one of the better efforts, thanks to a new storyline centering on the reincarnation of the mummy's lover into the body of a modern-day woman. John Carradine is on hand as the high priest who revives Kharis (Lon Chaney for a second time) and supplies him with tana fluid to keep him stalking. This chapter also features Chaney's best performance as Kharis, and you can definitely see his looks of sadness, frustration, and anger in key scenes. Ramsay Ames and Robert Lowery are weak as the leads, and they bring the evaluation of the movie down a notch. An easy 60 minutes of classic fun from Universal.",
         "This mummy film is one of a series of four produced by Universal Pictures in the 1940s--well after their original film starring Boris Karloff. While none of these films opened up a lot of new ground, they were good escapist fun--for kids and adults willing to suspend reality and have a good time. I personally LOVE these old Universal horror films--even the lesser ones like this film. This one's plot isn't so special (except once again the mummy somehow makes it to America), but it stands out due to the acting of George Zucco and John Carradine--two wonderful veteran horror actors who played up the campiness of the film and made it far more entertaining. The film looks a lot less impressive than the newest mummy films from Hollywood, but they still managed to be fun. Plus, the newer films, in my opinion, lack fun because they are so special effects-driven. See this film and have a good old fashioned time.",
         "(Spoilers!) Yet another Egyptian high priest, John Carradine, is sent to America to utilize the still-living mummy Kharis, Lon Chaney, to bring the mummy of the princess Ananka back to Egypt. I consider this film an improvement over the first two sequels of 'The Mummy.' Why? God knows it isn't the plot, which is the third recycling of the theme of the priest falling in instant lust for one of his intended victims. I have two reasons for enjoying this film more than the first two sequels; the first is the performers, and the second is surprise. John Carradine gives a terrific performance as high priest. Every scene he appears in is worth watching. Additionally, Lon Chaney desperately tries to breathe a little life into his character, particularly at the end when he obviously objects to Carradine's plan for the young lady. However, it is the ending of the film that ultimately gives it some true distinction. The heroes fail to save the woman in jeopardy! She perishes along with the Mummy. That's a true rarity for an American film of the time.",
         "This movie will scare the pants off of children. I grew up in the 50's. Our house was on a semi-rural road overshadowed on one side by a thick forest. At the foot of the tall hill upon which stood our house there was a swamp. The nearest neighbor was a quarter mile away. To an adult eye, the evening view on a moonlit night was, I am sure, romantic. To a child, however, the scene was an empty vessel ready to be filled with imaginary images of fearsome things. One weekend night, my parents left me in charge of my two younger brothers. I put them to bed and sat down to see what could possibly be on TV. An hour or so later, I lay in bed, in the moonlight, in a pool of sweat, thinking about tana leaves and the possibility, however remote, that a pot of them might have been mistakenly left simmering on the stove. In my imagination, I knew he was out there coming for me. It didn't matter if he was miles away or just down the road. He knew who I was; he had taken a special interest in me. Up the moonlit road, step by step, limping along, relentless, unstoppable. Somehow I made it through the night but that mummy stayed with me for years and inspired many a nightmare. My point here is that horror films are designed to scare you. We pay money to get scared. This one will do the trick if you're 10 years old and you're all alone (or almost alone -- when you're surrounded by mummies, you really do need an adult). Nine stars.",
         "Without being too nostalgic, my earliest memories of Universal Horror include the images of lovely Ramsay Ames rising out of her bed to follow the eerie shadow of Kharis out to her front yard, being carried off by the mummy and aging into a 3000 year old mummy herself, and sinking into a bog with her kidnapper as her boyfriend Robert Lowery and townspeople look on in shock. A vivid memory, and one in particular, because the lovely heroine did not reunite with her mortal leading man in the end, but rather joined the undead and opened the way for an interesting sequel later that year in 1944. Ramsay was 'discovered' by fellow Universal contractee Allan Jones at a Miami Beach nightclub and brought to Universal by same in early 1943. Ramsay, at that time, was the leader of an all-girl rumba orchestra, and did not fancy herself a leading lady, but took the opportunity at a movie contract in stride. Her first screen appearance was in the Olsen and Johnson comedy \"Crazy House,\" where she played herself, shaking her maracas and singing \"The Tropicana\" as Tony and Sally DeMarco danced away. Her next appearance was in the first Inner Sanctum chiller \"Calling Dr. Death\", where, frankly, she was rather poorly directed by Reggie LeBorg, and while she shows signs of real nastiness as the adulterous wife of Lon Chaney, what appears to be outtakes of her laughing at Chaney in a key scene brings her whole performance down somewhat in that feature. In true Hollywood style, horror queen Acquanetta was being filmed for a scene in the newest Universal chiller, 'Mummy's Ghost', and as she 'fainted' for a scene, struck her head on a stone in the pathway she was being photographed in. Acquanetta, being seriously hurt (a concussion), Universal replaced her with Ramsay, and the rest is horror film history. Ramsay looked gorgeous in her satin nightgown, wandering the streets of Mapleton, Mass., and, being carried away in the climax. After a great role in the Universal 'B' 'Hat Check Honey' where she played bitchy movie queen Mona Mallory, Ramsay left Universal for Warners, but only scored bit parts in 'Mildred Pierce', and 'Green Dolphin Street.' A serial followed, and the Monogram quickie, 'Beauty and the Bandit,' but Ramsay was never featured again in a true golden age Hollywood Classic. A friend once described to me that Ramsay was the 'Girl that every mother wanted her son to marry.' Absolutely gorgeous, and with a touch of spice and mystery she is one of the true Hollywood beauties of the 1940's that created the image of the Hollywood Starlet.",
         "This is a definitely better movie than the previous Unviversal movie entry \"The Mummy's Tomb\", from 2 years earlier. The story and characters are better again this time. Although this doesn't mean that the actual story is really that much special but at least they definitely put some effort in it. It's of course a quite silly story and it gets sort of tiresome how they keep bringing back the mummy back to life time after the time, no matter how often they have killed him off already in the previous movies. Same goes for the Andoheb role played by George Zucco. But oh well, at least the story keeps the movie enjoyable to watch. There aren't really any slow or dull moments ever in this movie. The movie features both John Carradine and Lon Chaney Jr. again in the role of the mummy. They were both like THE Universal horror movies stars at the time. It's not that they roles are that interesting within this movie but nevertheless their presence is enough to uplifts the movie and makes it all the more enjoyable to watch for the genre fans of the Universal '40's movies. Unlike the previous Universal mummy-entries, this movie does not feature an happy end, in which our hero kills the mummy and gets back the back. This was quite surprising and also a reason why this movie is better than just the average and typical Universal '40's horror attempt. The movie has some good typical Unverisal '40's horror moments. Of course it's nothing too scary, at least not by today's standards but it's very classy and good looking all, with the use of shadows and some handy camera-work. A perfectly watchable mummy-entry. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",
         "\"The Mummy's Ghost\" is a sequel to \"The Mummy's Tomb\" (1942). In that film Kharis the Mummy (Lon Chaney) perished in a house fire. Also the old high priest (George Zucco) dies of old age while handing over his powers to a new high priest. In this film we find out that not only did Kharis survive the fire unscathed but the old high priest turns up alive and shaking. This entry has the High Priest Yousef Bey (John Carradine) being assigned the task of going to America to retrieve the mummies of Kharis and his queen Ananka. Hero Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery) is courting a beautiful Egyptian by the name of Amina Mansouri (Ramsay Ames). Meanwhile Yousef Bey sets about arranging to take the two mummies back to Egypt. To this end he unleashes Kharis upon the community to murder anyone who stands in their way. At the same time Amina starts to experience blackouts as she is being gradually taken over by the spirit of Ananka (the \"ghost\" of the title) to become the re-incarnation of Queen Ananka. This suddenly becomes a point of issue between Kharis and Yousef Bey until...... Becoming a \"B\" movie second feature series, the films did nonetheless benefit from Universal's expertise in making this kind of film. Although it features a \"B\" list cast and runs a scant 61 minutes, it is still an entertaining way to spend an hour. Lon Chaney would continue in the role of the Mummy in \"The Mummy's Curse\" (1944) the final film in the series."
