         "Sugar Hill is an intense movie that exposes the harsh reality of drug addiction and drug dealing. Roemello(Snipes) and Raynathan(Wright) are two brothers who are drug dealers in Harlem. Snipes and Wright gave great performances. Sugar Hill has a lot of drama and suspense and it is very realistic. The film has al ot of great monologue, And the message is very clear: \"Don't Do Drugs\".",
         "I have always loved this film and will always love this film till my dying days. It reminds me of a time when Black cinema broke the mold with the stories that were told and how those stories were told. Sugar Hill is a well written and well acted tale film noir drama that never got the respect it truly deserves. Roemello(Wesley Snipes) wants to break free from a world of crime but is constantly dragged back in. He cant live a normal life or have a girlfriend in it because something bad is always happening around him. His brother Raynathan(Michael Wright) is very high-strung and causes some of Roemello's problems plus he has to deal with his drug-addicted father A.R.(Clarence Williams III). Wesley Snipes best performance is Roemello Skuggs. This movie proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that Wesley can act as well as play a serious role. Michael Wright is good as Raynathan even though he can get buckwild at times. Clarence Williams III is excellent as their drug-afflicted father A.R. He was always a great actor that never got enough credit for great roles such as this one, Hoodlum and Deep Cover. Theresa Randle is is pretty good as Roemello's girlfriend Melissa. She is innocent in the sense that she is not numb to death and violence and actually feels pain upon seeing something like for instance a dead body. Melissa is gorgeous as well as likable. There are also some strong performances by Abe Vigoda and Ernie Hudson. I love the setting of the movie as well as the cinematography. Director Leon Ichaso has an eye for scenery and you can see that as you watch this movie. Its a shame that the movie didn't do well and the director never did another movie again. I would have liked to see another movie from him. In short Sugar Hill is an underrated masterpiece. No self-respecting fan of Black Cinema should be without a copy of Sugar Hill. PS: don't allow these trend-following cookie-cutter review writing craven sheep that run amok on IMDb dictate to you what is a good film. As far as they're concerned any film that doesn't make the Top 250 is not worth viewing. The opinions of spineless puppets are absolutely worthless.",
         "I really felt this story starring Wesley Snipes and Michael Wright. It really shows the struggle of two brothers up to their present point in time, of how they were exposed to the drug game at such an early age from the death of their strung out mother to the crippling of their father thanks to the mafia. It was such a real story that sent out a strong message that got through to me - it's kind of a good guy/bad guy hood flick with a strong crime element and brutal murder scenes. Wesley Snipes is great as the hustler w/ a conscience but it was Michael Wright who delivers as the trigger-happy older brother who will murder just about anything that tries to invade his... Sugar Hill is a movie that packs a wicked punch...great movie - in urban cinema this is easily a classic",
         "Sugar Hill was one of the most thought provking films about drugs released in the early nineties. Wesley Snipes is brilliant in the lead role of Romello a drug dealer who wants to go straight when he finds love. Micheal Wright the scene stealer is even better as his brother Ray the more violent of the two. But the standout performance belongs to Clarenece Williams III as the drug addicted father. I give *** out of ****.",
         "A superior Godfather part 3, this story touched me, just like the godfather trilogy it doesn't glorify the life unlike goodfellas makes it interesting, it isn't about masterminding a criminal plot, it looks at the people affected by it negatively, such as the brothers dad who was really a symbol of what the brothers had turned many people into, the little bits that tell us romello is disturbed by this is beautiful, reminds me of requiem for a dream, Romellos character is also one of the most interesting of the genre, a man who is still obviously a hardened gangsta yet still has a distinct human side as witnessed by his killing of one of his best friends murderers, where he states sincerely \"im not like m brother\" before delivering a fatal gunshot. As for the ending where Michael Wrights character enters the room with gus and the dealer, so troubled and proceeds to waste em both, in my opinion is one of the best scenes i have ever seen. i have only ever this movie once, yet it still strikes me as the best movie out of the 350 or so I've seen including many in the top 250 and i always name it as my favourite, please makers give it a region 2 release so i can once again live this film.",
         "As titles for this film go, I prefer Sugar Hill to Harlem. The title Harlem speaks to where the characters are. The title Sugar Hill refers to an ideal that has been lost and may never be regained. Harlem would be a simplistic title for a simplistic movie, while Sugar Hill is an appropriate title for a movie that frequently aims high and sometimes succeeds. So you'll forgive me if if I refer to it as Sugar Hill in this review (plus, I'm not really sure where it was actually released as \"Harlem\"). Sugar Hill opens with a series of pictures of urban life in the Sugar Hill part of Harlem. Since the photos are all black and white and since the people look happy and middle class, we know that these pictures are of the way things used to be. We then meet our two \"heroes,\" Raynathan and Romoello Skuggs, as children who stand by and watch as their mother ODs on heroin and dies before their eyes. Even though she was a junkie, their mom wished for great things for her sons, but as we move into the present, Roemello's voiceover tells the hard truth: \"The boy you loved as become the man you feared.\" Roemello (Wesley Snipes) and Raynathan (Michael Wright) control the drug trade in a part of the borough. They live a ghetto fabulous lifestyle with fancy rayon suits and fine cars. They get nice tables at classy restaurants. But things are about to change. The local mafioso Gus (Abe Vigoda) is letting a new dealer (Ernie Hudson) move in on their turf. Roemello wants out, having seen what drugs did to his father (Clarence Williams III), once a promising musician, now a struggling drug addict. But Raynathan -- the less intelligent, but more emotional of the brothers -- wants to start a turf war. The film has a \"B\" story involving a romance between Roemello and a beautiful woman (Theresa Randle) who loves Roemello, but is affair to be around him. Sugar Hill plays a bit like New Jack City (both movies were written by Barry Michael Cooper). At its best, it feels like a smarter and more mature film than Mario Van Peebles's classic modern blaxploitation film. There's a complexity to Sugar Hill that New Jack City lacked once it regressed into a cops-vs-gangsters story. There's no law in Sugar Hill, no Judd Nelson to mess things up with moralizing. In Sugar Hill we've only got bad and worse. Snipes's Roemello rules over the city like a God, holding the fate of thousands in his hand. Director Leon Ichaso goes a little too far to make this point. Snipes is constantly shot on rooftops and verandas, anywhere he can look out on his kingdom and loom over it. As a visual metaphor, it's effective, but it sometimes places a little too broadly, which is at odds with Snipes's wonderful, internalized performance. Snipes is physically intimidating, but as an actor he has sufficient brains to carry the film. His Roemello is the ego to the id of New Jack City's Nino Brown. Actually, the film is full of amazing performances accentuated by the script's willingness to stop the action to allow the characters to tell stories. As the burnout father, Clarence Williams III (that would be \"Linc\" from the original Mod Squad) is just amazing and the story he tells Raynathan as he's about to shoot up is a devastating show-stopper. Vigoda also gives a performance tempered by age, and also has a super monologue, where he remembers the way Harlem used to be. Michael Wright's Raynathan grows on you. At first the acting seems too manic, but when you realize that it's a cover for how deeply he depends on his brother, it gains depth and Wright carries the film's final twenty minutes. Randle is fine in her romantic moments, but becomes shrieky when the role calls for high-pitched emotion. Sugar Hill goes on for too long. It runs over two hours and there's no excuse for that. The plot involving Ernie Hudson's ex-boxer (Hudson is also excellent playing against type here) has confusing moments and there are several peripheral mob characters whose roles are never fully explained. Theresa Randle also has a very strange and random encounter with a basketball star (Vondie Curtis-Hall) which seems to have been in the script for symbolic reasons that just don't pay off properly. On the whole, Sugar Hill works for me because of the consistent aura of sadness which fills the film. This movie isn't anywhere near as fun as New Jack City. It's not flashy, it's somber. But it worked well enough for me to give is a 7/10 recommendation.",
         "Clarance Williams III, Gave one of the best performances by a black character actor I have ever seem, he portrays an elderly junkie in this fast pace and exciting movie. Sugar Hill is a picture that every african american should see, it has all the qualities that make a motion picture excellent, see it, and you will never forget this movie. Wesley Snipes also gave a great part as the head of the herion empire in Harlem, he and his brother started from nothing, and move to become feared by the white society and the mob, what kept them going is there love for each other, it is something that we should always remember between two people, I know that I will never forget the chemistry they had in this movie.",
         "\"Sugar Hill\" tells the story of two Harlem drug-dealing brothers, Romello & Ray Nathan Skuggs, who struggle to stay on top of their chosen profession as well as their relationship with drug-addicted father Arthur Romello Skuggs(Clarence Williams III). Romello realizes that his life has gone in the wrong direction & that he wants out, to honor his deceased mother's wishes for him. Ray Nathan(Michael Wright), heir apparent to the drug ring, wants to get rid of the competition & rule Harlem with his younger brother. Romello(Wesley Snipes), fed up & idealistic, wants out of the drug business & is looking to start over with new girlfriend Melissa(Theresa Randle). Scared of becoming a target, Melissa wants nothing to do with Romello who convinces her to leave with him. Romello tries to bring together a bitter Ray Nathan & strung-out druggie Arthur to no avail. Romello forgave his father for the past & desires Ray Nathan to reconcile before its too late. Ray Nathan is still angry with his father for the death of junkie mother Ella Skuggs. Romello finally convinces Melissa to be with him & leave to begin a new life together. Romello wants only to take Ray Nathan, Arthur, Melissa & himself back to the South to start over & away from the drug & street life. The problem: Gus(Abe Vigoda), an old Italian drug lord & Lolly(Ernie Hudson), new drug dealer & ex boxing champ, want the brothers out of the way as well as their territories in the drug trade. Gus has a history with Arthur Romello & makes Romello aware of it. Gus told Romello that his father killed his brother Sal many years ago. Lolly kills fellow dealer & best friend Ricky Goggles(Steve Harris) as a warning to Romello & Ray Nathan. Ray Nathan in turn murders one of Gus's men. Lolly calls in a hit on Romello but kills a local wannabe gangster Kymie Daniels(Donald Faison). Romello tells Gus he is out of the game & prepares to leave with Melissa. Ray Nathan kills Arthur by giving him a overdosed shot of heroin. Ray next goes to Gus & Lolly to concede but instead kills them in the restaurant. Ray Nathan then runs into Romello & tells him he killed their father. The two argue with Ray Nathan accidentally shooting Romello with Melissa watching in horror. The film ends with Romello sitting in a wheelchair with Melissa & son living in the South, starting life anew. A good film with a very tragic ending. Unbelievable scene where Arthur(Williams III)overdoses while Ray Nathan watches in horror & shame. The realism of Arthur's overdose is unforgettable & wreaks of solid acting talent. This film does little to glorify drug dealers & rightfully so. No Nino Browns to despise this time!! Check it out.",
         "This is an excellent movie with a tremendous performance by Wesley Snipes. He is a much better actor than he gets credit for, with terrific range. A story of a street drug dealer trying to break free of the life he has led. Unfortunately, circumstances and people conspire to threaten his dreams. A very interesting, thoughtful movie, with a great performance by Snipes and Clarence Williams.",
         "Sex, money, and drugs. Broken families, and broken dreams. You'll recognize the lead character Romello as played by Wesley Snipes right away, but Michael Wright (of +The 5 Heartbeats+ and the TV series 'V: The Final Battle') turns in a strong and compelling performance of his own as Rome's brother Ray Nathan. The action builds slowly, until the kettlepot boils over at the end, so this is not a movie for those lacking patience. It's worth the wait to see Wright and Snipes struggle through their harsh reality, and to see Snipes try in vain to resurrect a family life with his father in the film that didn't exist and never would. Powerful and compelling, you'll want to see this movie more than once."
