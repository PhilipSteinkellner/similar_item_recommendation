However, I liked his performance and this film is worth watching because of his presence. The two female leads were just okay, especially Salma Hayek looked much better over Jessica Alba which seems her career is almost over. This is a story of a Cambridge professor who moved to the States after fallen in love with an American student. But just after a few years later he comes crashing down with trouble in the marriage, but he decides to fight for his son at any cost.\r\n\r\nThe story was good, but should have been improvised a little. And the theme might make uncomfortable for some because of a man falling in love with both the sister. Yet very matured and a fine flavour for people with the open mind. There were some fun, especially comparing the booze culture and students' behavious between the two countries. This is a three year old film, but got released different market at different time and I saw it now that I think it was much better than I anticipated after knowing the respond it's got.\r\n\r\n6/10",

         "I read reviews and expected disaster. In fact it's quite different from what one may expect. It is not a typical romantic comedy, there is a lot of satire on the American way of living, while the whole film should not be taken too seriously. It is a fun, beautiful places, good acting. Just some life reality, although shown from a little bit funny perspective. Just enjoy it, because you can. I am a real fan of Brosnan and think he delivers as usual. Handsome despite his age, keeps just a proper distance to himself and the guy he plays. All leading actors are just fine and convincing. Watch it and you will enjoy it. May by this is not an extremely ambitious and complicated movie, but don't we need some fun from time to time? In addition, the backdrop landscape is just so nice to watch. So why not give it a go.",
         "Review: I quite enjoyed this cleverly written Rom-Com, because it had different elements that kept it interesting throughout. It is a bit predictable but the acting was realistic and the adult humour was quite amusing in parts. Its about a highly respected professor, Richard Haig (Pierce Brosnan), who teaches 18th century romantic poetry in a way that the students of today can appreciate. His father Gordon (Macolm McDowell) was also a professor at highly respected Trinity College in Cambridge, so he seeks the same accomplishments that his father achieved before he retired. He's also picked up his father's womanising ways, by falling for one of his students, Kate (Jessica Alba), who shocks him with the news that she is pregnant. She decides to move back to Malibu so she can raise there child, Jake (Duncan Joiner) and her sister Olivia (Salma Hayek) decides to move to New York to pursue her career in writing romantic books. As Richard wants to be close to his son, he also moves to Malibu and he takes a job in a school, teaching students who don't really care for his specialised subject. He then finds out that his wife is having an affair with a younger man, who she has fallen in love with, so he moves into the annex of the house to be close to his son and to keep his green card. After a while, Olivia also moves into the house because she has caught her boyfriend with another woman and while Kate and her new boyfriend Brian (Ben McKenzie) are away, she grows closer to Richard and after a passionate night together, they soon realise that there feelings for each other are more than what was expected. After having to leave America because his green card had run out, Richard spends time with his dying father, whose last wish is for his son to get back with Olivia. This film definitely has its emotional moments, with a witty script which was well put together by the director. Macolm McDowell's foul mouth character, made me laugh and the relationship between Brosnan and his son was touching. After watching Pierce Brosnan kick butt in the earlier Bond movies, I'm still struggling to take his comedic roles that seriously but you can't fault his performances which are always top class. Some of the situations that he gets himself in, were a bit silly but the overall concept of the film was watchable and enjoyable in parts. Watchable! Round-Up: Pierce Brosnan, 62 and still looking dashing, hasn't reached the heights that he reached when he was playing Bond but he is still highly respected in Hollywood, even though his movies haven't made that much money of late. Films like the Love Punch with Emma Thompson, Love is All We Need, Survivor and A Long Way Down, haven't really blown up at the box office and some of them went straight to DVD but thats not to say that they were bad movies. I personally would like to see him play another \"Bond\" type role because of his cool persona, which really worked in the 007 franchise. Anyway, this movie was directed by Tom Vaughan, 46, who also brought you What Happens in Vegas with Ashton Kutcher and Extraordinary Measures with Harrison Ford but most of his experience has been TV. He was lucky to get Salma Hayek and Jessica Alba together for this project but they both have been out of the spotlight of late. Hayek hasn't had a major role in a movie since the terrible Grown Ups 2 in 2013 and I wasn't that impressed with Everly. She still looks great at 49 and she usually puts in great performances, along with Alba, 34, who recently starred in the Entourage movie. Anyway, this movie is a decent watch with some good performances but if your not into your Rom-Com's, then this movie isn't for you. I recommend this movie to people who are into their comedy/romance movies starring Pierce Brosnan, Salma Hayek, Jessica Alba and Malcolm McDowell. 5/10",
         "I believe Pierce Brosnan is perfect for the role he had in this film: a university English teacher that is both lecherous and intellectual, romantic and a total ass, a good father and a terrible partner, yet lovable and accessible nonetheless. Such a character has a fantastic potential to create a wonderful story. However, the story was sub par, the other characters cardboard and so many opportunities were missed out again and again. If I were to rate this film on the characters, I would have to give an 8 or even 9 to Brosnan's, but something close to 3 for Jessica Alba's. Salma Hayek's wasn't a lot better either and Malcolm McDowell, as the father, was 0-dimensional! I understand old actors get fewer jobs, but have you seen any of this guy's films? Can't you see how much better he could have been if given some good material? Bottom line: it's an American Britspoitation film, based entirely on Pierce Brosnan's charm, with a little bit of McDowell sprinkled in the cast to get old people like me interested. So much story potential and so many talented actors completely wasted by Hollywood accountants.",
         "Now this movie does have its moments of being relatively cheesy, but it wasn't that bad. I found myself becoming more into the movie as it progressed, never mind the beauty of both female leads. I'm not typically a fan of watching movies more than once, but this one definitely goes on my re-watchable list. A fairly predictable ending but didn't bother my interest in wanting to keep finding out what happens. Give it a chance, you just might be glad you did.",
         "Richard Haig (Pierce Brosnan) is a well-respected English professor in the United Kingdom, with fiery lectures that were directly inspired from his father and a serious, nonconformist attitude to life and literature. Richard is also a womanizer, indulging in relationships with many of his beautiful undergraduate students that admire him for his aged beauty and intellect. He currently finds himself infatuated with Kate (Jessica Alba), a twenty-five-year-old American woman, who he winds up marrying and having a kid with, much to his surprise initially, but to his delight eventually. Despite this relationship, Richard has always found Kate's sister Olivia (Salma Hayek) incredibly gorgeous as well, and finally gets his chance to win her over when Kate asks for a divorce upon meeting someone from her work that loves and cares about her more than he does. Richard already has ninety-nine problems and this isn't one of them. Excusing the fact he had to move across the country in order for his marriage to Kate to work without complication, Richard is also an illegal immigrant and needs to gain citizenship if he hopes to stay in the country. With a divorce in the works and a recent DUI on his record, Richard is anything but a sure bet to gain citizenship to the United States. It's only some sick karmic revenge that during all of this, Richard realizes the torment of womanizing and trying to maintain the upkeep on numerous relationships since he can't commit to one woman. Some Kind of Beautiful is the kind of film I'd ostensibly loathe; admittedly, just the plot made me cringe as I thought of nothing more than an unlikable brute not realizing the ill of his ways. Even as someone who finds commitment and real relationships to be one of the most beautiful things in the world, Some Kind of Beautiful resonated with me as a piece of delightful Kabuki Theater, for lack of a better term, though I'm sure members of Kabuki Theater would look at this film and roll their eyes. This is a zany, screwball comedy at its core, the kind that has gone by the wayside in favor of more romantic, if incredulous, displays of romance and over-the-top comedy, despite lacking half the comedic talent and screen writing craziness. Keep in mind, Some Kind of Beautiful focuses on a contemptible character and his decisions throughout the film raise red-flags on a consistent basis. On top of that, many situations find themselves not only flirting but dancing with improbability. I'm not afraid to admit that. The problem is that Some Kind of Beautiful, with its trailers, its poster/DVD cover, and its overall sunniness paint it as your average romantic-comedy, brimful of hope and optimism. This is anything but a cheery, feel-good romantic-comedy. Think of the Paul Rudd and Amy Poehler-headlined They Came Together from a few years back, which was a self-referential jab at the onslaught of ridiculous romantic-comedies. Some Kind of Beautiful basically takes the disposition and approach to the genre tropes of a romantic-comedy, and proceeds to spit in its face with its cynical grip on the story and the focus on a despicable character. A large part of the film's success is attributable to Brosnan, who does a smooth job at playing both unlikable, but undeniably suave. One could analyze the character he plays in a very psychological manner, even making claims that his lack of respect for women and constant desire for \"something newer or better\" is a result of his father's four marriages, his drinking, or his possible sex addiction. The problem with that assertion is director Tom Vaughan and screenwriter Matthew Newman don't seem to embellish those instances and simply propose them in passing. The real issue is Brosnan's Richard character, who does many unconscionable things throughout the course of this film. The one thing he seems to consistently do right is treat his son with care and respect, for what that's worth. He never blows him off, never breaks a promise, and always knows how to calm him down in the face of danger or trouble. Furthermore, this film, for as unlikable as its characters can be and for as ugly as its situations can be, has a spirited supporting cast of both Alba and Hayek, particularly Hayek, who help command the screen and work well on their own, even if their chemistry with Brosnan directly doesn't always hold weight. There's never a real spark with either of these women with Brosnan, but perhaps that's only fitting for the premise and idea of this film. When you embark on the life of disconnect and lack of commit that Richard has, a spark is not what you'll get - an endless cycle of heartbreak and disappoint seems to be more fitting. Some Kind of Beautiful also manages to be pretty uproariously funny more often than it isn't, and that's largely because everyone here is great at performing the classic roles screwball comedy requires in order to be success. The performers are capable of physical comedy routines that are frantic and scatterbrained without being too ridiculous, and the situations here, while many are incredulous, have a way of coming off as at least believable for the world of the film. For many films, that's about as much as you can ask, and while this may not be the cleanest and happiest comedy you'll see this year, it is a lot funnier and more positive than its subject matter often allows. Starring: Pierce Brosnan, Jessica Alba, and Salma Hayek. Directed by: Tom Vaughan.",
         "Started out in a rather predictable way and somewhere in the middle kinda grabs you. Certainly a movie for the more romantically inclined...but even the most cynical will be touched. Just be a movie lover and let it play out... the actors are interesting to watch. The backdrop of California and England are shown with excellent cinematography and the music soundtrack works. It is a movie that the critics will never like but a genuine mover lover will be entertained. Pierce Brosnan, Selma Hayek and Jessica Alba had good chemistry and were enjoyable to watch on screen. Duncan Joiner as Jake was delightful to watch and was very convincing the young son in love with both of his parents..",
         "For starters, I have to say I love all these actors. But this is a terrible mess. So bad that it should be taught in film schools as an example of what not to do. Every few minutes the actors begin to save it, and then either the direction or the script lets them down. At various points in the \"action\" the comedy completely rests on sight gags that may have been fresh in the silent era. Brosnan, one of my favorite actors - (if you haven't seen Matador, watch it now) tries very hard to sustain his role as the romantic spindle around which Salma Hayek and Jessica Alba revolve, but the plot is so interrupted, the motivations so compromised and the reality of the situation so ignored, that even he fails. The only thing funny is your own disbelief at how utterly crappy this film is. Worth watching for research in the same sense that the NTSB likes picking through wreckage.",
         "The whole plot has to be scripted from an insane person with a cynicism for a twisted, hellish so-called romantic movie. As another reviewer said it's all a mess. There's little chemistry between the characters, little development and most importantly no logic to what the hell is happening. This could have been written by a six year old and it may even be better! If you want a quick summary of the movie it's about people cheating on each other and with their sisters. While it tries to make this obscure plot work it falls flat leaving the viewer with a really, really bad taste. I am surprise the kid is not in an insane asylum or that he didn't become Jason and start killing every one of the cheating adults. Add to that horror the movie wants to put them all together. The cheating mother, the cheating father, the cheating sister, the cheater boyfriend and the innocent kid all in one roof. Imagine this; your wife cheats on you, brings the bf home to sleep and live in the same house as you and at the same time you are sleeping with young girls while trying to hide everything from the kid. Yea, it's that psychotic. Skip the movie and save your sanity for those that already endured the pain.",
         "This film is about a British university professor who falls on love with an American student. She becomes pregnant, they all move to USA to start a new life, by unfortunately things go wrong and they separate soon afterwards. \"How to Make Love Like an Englishman\" has a comedic title, but it is not comedic at all. The three main characters are not only unsympathetic, but actually obnoxious. No one remains faithful to their partners, everyone is foul mouthed. People act irresponsibly at just about every occasion, such as ruining the alcoholic anonymous meeting, or playing with the sister when the green card appointment is in a few days. If Richard really wants to stay in USA, he should at least act a bit more responsibly. Many things in the film don't make sense either, such as Kate staying at the house next door to let her sister take care of the son. Avoid this film. It's not funny at all, actually it's infuriating to watch.",
         "\"You can leave me, but I am not leaving that boy.\" Richard (Brosnan) is a college professor who teaches the classics and has a young and beautiful wife. When he finds out she is leaving him his life is shattered. He throws everything into his son and trying to get a new job. Things get complicated when he starts to notice Olivia (Hayek) in a different way and a problem with his Visa comes up. Now Richard must try to get a job, stay in the country, and find love with someone he never expected to. Judging by the synopsis you may think this sounds like a cookie cutter movie, and your right. The movie is pretty predictable and not original but it is funny and very watchable. Pierce Brosnan is a great choice for this and he really saves the movie from being something overly generic. There really isn't a whole lot to say about this since there has been a million movies with this same idea but even so this is still a good movie and defiantly worth a watch. I did like it but I am also a big Pierce Brosnan fan. Overall, nothing original but entertaining and funny. Worth seeing at least once. I give this a B.",
         "Hayek, Alba and Brosnan work it out. I didn't have any idea what I was expecting with this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised and pleased. It had some good humor, which is the COM part and it had some intimacy, which is the ROM part. That sums it up for ROMCOM. It is an enjoyable, light-heart-ed movie. It is also a great date flick. Of course, I adore my Latinas! The little boy was excellent in his role as well. The acting was great, especially the father's eye's when he looked at his son (Brosnan) with great intent. I've never seen such a piercing set of eyes with intensity. I rated this a bit higher to see if we can get it to a Solid 6 Stars. I don't care for enjoyable movies being below 6 Stars. If you like ROMCOM's, you will enjoy it as well.",
         "I loved this because it showed me that we've been sleeping on Pierce Brosnan out side of James Bond. What makes this Englishman think that he can woo women successfully? James Bond. Remington Steele. That's what. Ahhhh! But I saw as a Terroirst/Asssasin in \"Survivor\" with Ms. Jovinch ( I hope that's right). Anyway, after that I realized that I've been sleeping on Pierce. This movie is interesting beyond compare. It consists of Pierce, Selma Hayek, Ben McKenzie ( from Gotham), Malcolm McDowell. The story line is along the lines of very Rom-Com but it's fun and juicy. I love Selma's role with Jessuca Alba backing her up. This movie will make you laugh and clap your hands as root for the bad guy/good guy/ lover boy which changes characters. You must see this just to Deke's wife from \"The King of Queens\". Must see.",
         "Someone needs to warn folks to avoid this piece of rubbish. I wasted $7.99 renting this on Xfinity - thinking I was going to be entertained with a feel good, romantic comedy. This is not what I experienced. It is more about the failure of the elderly lead male character to grow up. An online magazine did a good review where the reviewer stated the movie should be titled, \"Some Kind of Chauvinist Bull....\" I only wish I had been smart enough to read it before subjecting myself to this offensive piece of rubbish. I adore all of the actors and cannot understand for the life of me how something this BAD could be produced when so many talented people are cast. What a MAJOR disappointment! AWFUL & SLIMY!",

Richard does the right thing and goes with his young bride to LA, which is \"a lot like Cambridge with palm trees and chicks with tans.\" Meanwhile he has met Kate's half sister (Salma Hayek) and we pretty much know the plot after their first encounter and subtitle \"Every good love story has three sides.\" This is a romantic comedy that has no heart. I didn't establish feelings for the characters. Richard and Kate are initially developed to the point of us feeling \"meh\" about them. While it has a happy ending, it didn't grab me. It was not a Puffs moment. It is a film you will soon forget as Salma Hayek's butt/side breast gets posted to Mr. Skin. Ho-Hum. Guide: F-bomb. Sex. Brief rear nudity. Jessica Alba bra/panties.",
         "The story of this film is kind of predictable for a romantic comedy: lecherous, but gifted poetry professor is gradually reformed through his love for a quirkily unusual woman. In this case, the professor, Richard Haig (played by Pierce Brosnan), also has a cantankerous old father (Macolm McDowell) and a son Jake (Duncan Joiner). He is also, not that surprisingly, torn between two sisters - Kate (Jessica Alba), the boy's mother and her very much more Spanish sounding sister Olivia (Salma Hayek). The first 25 minutes of the film is set in the UK and we are treated to every cinematic cliché in the book. There is even a scene in which our Prof rides a motorbike passed various London landmarks rushing to get to his appointment. The characters and plot are introduced and nothing gels at all; everything is over the top as we move from one cliché to the next. Kate decides to move back to the US but there are still more clichés to present, like rabbits from a hat. The prof's fawningly attentive Cambridge students are exchanged for a new caricatured American set whose whole attention remains permanently with their laptops and mobiles. During the build-up to an agonisingly predictable scene of the Prof getting drunk at a formal reception you might feel you cannot possibly stand it any more... But have courage: the half time whistle is about to blow. And then, quite suddenly, the whole thing turns around. To be precise, for me (watching on Netflix) this was 38 minutes in to the 1 hour, 35 minute movie. There are still clichés to be sure, but suddenly the actors seem to have a feel for their characters. They seem to be having fun. The situation, although it is fairly contrived, feels more real and we start to care about what happens to our Prof and his son and whether the Prof will manage to get the right sister in the end - or not. So... At the start, only give the film half your attention: cook dinner, hoover, do the ironing, whatever. Then settle to watch it properly after half an hour and it should seem quite good.",
         "It was a decent romance-comedy, but Pierce Brosnan was too old to play this role. However, I liked his performance and this film is worth watching because of his presence. The two female leads were just okay, especially Salma Hayek looked much better over Jessica Alba which seems her career is almost over. This is a story of a Cambridge professor who moved to the States after fallen in love with an American student. But just after a few years later he comes crashing down with trouble in the marriage, but he decides to fight for his son at any cost. The story was good, but should have been improvised a little. And the theme might make uncomfortable for some because of a man falling in love with both the sister. Yet very matured and a fine flavour for people with the open mind. There were some fun, especially comparing the booze culture and students' behavious between the two countries. This is a three year old film, but got released different market at different time and I saw it now that I think it was much better than I anticipated after knowing the respond it's got. 6/10",
         "Everything about this movie is cliché: the story, the dialogs, and even the ending. The cast is made of great actors, but not even they were enough to save this film from a catastrophic failure. Most of the characters add absolutely nothing to the plot. The direction, however, was the worst part of the movie. Some continuity errors were quite amateurish, like the scene {MILD SPOILER FOLLOWS} where Olivia (Hayek) is driving Richard's (Brosnan) Mustang: they leave their house with the child's seat quite visible in the backseat. Throughout all of their drive in LA, the seat is not in the car (as in completely removed), but when they arrive at their destination, Jake's school, the seat is again visible. This mistake is so amateurish, so basic, that from that moment on my hopes for a good movies went down the drain. Do yourself a favor and watch something else. Like the police say in crime scenes: \"move along, nothing to see here\"!",
         "This comedy is quite fun to watch with a middle aged professor and his two lovely love interests who are considerably younger. There are some astute observations about differences between the US and the UK. The contrast between English students and American students is funny. Liked the twist where the one facing deportation is a white guy and the Hispanics are legal. The commentary about excessive drinking in the British culture is right on. The villa is quite idyllic. Pierce Brosnan is well preserved so things don't look icky. He didn't let himself go like some other actors his age. Still looks better than Daniel Craig. Salma Hayek is lovely and should be on screen more. Jessica Alba is pretty and makes her annoying character appealing. Supporting cast Ben McKenzie is not quite right. Malcolm McDowell is a bit young to be Pierce's father. It's worth one watch.",
         "This romantic comedy had lots of promise and failed on so many fronts. The producers were clearly banking on people wanting to see the sexy stars (Pierce Brosnan, Salma Hayek, and Jessica Alba) to sell this movie. It sure would have helped if they had a decent script to go with it. The dialog is silly and trite, the plot lines are very flawed, and the directing is poor. The scriptwriter and director were clearly following the textbook rom-com formula. A good example of the flawed plot and characters is the drama caused Kate finding out that by Richard slept with Olivia. Kate got married and Richard married her and move to America with her to raise their child. SHe rewards this by cheating on him and telling him she has found another. He moves into the pool house and has to watch her with her boyfriend for 2 years. The entire time she treats him poorly and wants him to move on. Then the half sister Olivia visits and Richard developed feelings for her and they sleep together. When Kate finds out she flips out, tells her sister to leave, refuses to go to Richards immigration interview knowing that it would cause him to get deported, separating Richard from their son who clearly loves him, and then refuses all communication with her sister. This is the woman that cheated on her husband and rubbed it in for 2 year. You would have thought she would have been miffed but not to this level of extreme behavior. But the silly plot required this artificial drama to give the main character (Richard) an obstacle to overcome that in doing so would bring everyone back together. Very trite. At least we get to see Jessica in her underwear and Salma's naked butt a few times.",
         "Lessons in Love is a rom com that does not always hit its marks. It is not too romantic, uproariously funny or makes biting comments about academia. I just thought Michael Douglas did this better in Wonder Boys. Richard (Pierce Brosnan) is a literature professor married to the much younger Kate (Jessica Alba) and they have a son together and he has moved to the USA. However Kate is having an affair and Richard hits on her older sister Olivia (Salma Hayek) who herself is in an estranged marriage as she found her husband cheating on her. Richard has had a hell raising life just like his father also a college professor. Now being pursued by the immigration authorities for overstaying his visa, arrested for drunk driving he is trying to spend as much time with his young son and find a spark in his teaching and a permanent job. There are a few good gags but it feels predictable. Malcolm McDowall's northern accent is at odds with Brosnan's Irish brogue. Oscar winner Marlee Matlin is wasted in a small role but Brosnan seems to be enjoying himself in playing the old charming rogue.",
         "A convoluted story appositely made to show on the screen some very good actors, the Ocean, Cambridge (UK), College classrooms, beautiful houses, beautiful cars, beautiful people\u0085 I know (we all know) how hard it could be to write an original comedy these days, so I won't complain. But this really was (in my opinion) one of the laziest script a man can conceive to justify the mixing of the above mentioned elements together. I'd like you to know in advance what is expecting you: nothing boring, nothing unpleasant, nothing unexpected, nothing you could possibly believe (or love).",
         "Pierce go back to Ireland and dig ditches. You sir are a terrible (using the term very loosely here) actor. This film is blatantly pretentious and sophomoric in its delivery of \"comedic\" situations. The scene set ups for the punchlines are telegraphed so therefore the lines fall flat scene after scene. There are no surprise laughs in \"Some Kind of Beautiful\" only tried and not so true repeats of gags boringly reproduced in other Hollywood flops. The two \"girls\" playing opposite Pierce are totally forgettable and if its even remotely possible have done sever damage to there acting careers by being in this rabid dog of a movie. The boy playing Pierce's son was the only refreshingly good bit in this entire movie.This movie is definitely not a value for your time or your money. I rated it a 2, or 1 above the worst rating because of the boy's performance.",
         "One reviewer commented that 'the only thing funny is your own disbelief about how utterly crappy this film was\" I also was surprised at my denial because of the smiles between Pierce Brosnan and Selma. You can't put a smile under a microscope and that is why this Some Kind Of Beautiful satire on life is worth watching. The professor reminded me of professors I had while in graduate school : with a special emphasis in depth psychology and the German romantics. A year after the affairs with the younger students, the Professors of depth psychology were let go. I ended up writing my thesis on the clinical application of fairy tales. However after seeing this film would re name it \"Eros Without Boundaries\" Why is it artists and professors think they can make love to the whole world: younger sisters and students ? Artists who think they can make love to the whole world seem \"pretentious\" said one reviewer. Or maybe they are like Father Chronos (time) who keep swallowing younger and younger women until they swallow a stone and die. Am not sure what the reviewer meant by pretentious, but the homes and outfits were lavish. That is except for Selma who lost her high heel and the old mustang. This was also true of the graduate school I attended: a Spanish villa monastic retreat with amazing views and its own organic vegetable garden which was prepared by cooks for the weekend retreat. Was it the beauty of the place that hosted incestuous relationships between much older professors and girls old enough to be their daughter? Jack Nicholsonn was born of his sister due to blurred boundaries of his alcoholic father. Incestuous relationships do make for what another reviewer called \"plot so interrupted, motivations so compromised and reality so ignored that even the main character played by Pierce failed\" However, Isn't that the purpose of filmmaking: to reflect back the satire and collective unconscious of our times? Didn't Clinton have a relationship with a woman old enough to be his daughter? I interpreted this collective unconscious to be : narcissistic self absorption, madness, the lure of love, death romanticism and the drunkards craving for unconsciousness: not being accountable for actions. Looking forward to seeing 007 get some better scripts.",
         "Richard Haig (Pierce Brosnan) is a womanizing professor of the romantics following his legendary professor father Gordon (Malcolm McDowell)'s footsteps. His students adore him especially the female ones. His latest fling is his student Kate (Jessica Alba). He flirts with Olivia (Salma Hayek) who turns out to be Kate's older sister. Olivia disapproves of him. Kate reveals her pregnancy and he follows her to LA. His new family life is problematic. Kate is cheating with Brian (Ben McKenzie) and his students are bored. There is no joy and nothing romantic. It's not funny. There is nobody to like. It's simply sad and unappealing. The only hope is some chemistry between Brosnan and Hayek. It isn't there. There's nothing here."
