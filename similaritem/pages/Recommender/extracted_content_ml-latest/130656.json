         "The fact that Henri Charriere wrote this script and acted in the film is the only reason it hasn't slipped into oblivion long ago. For anyone who has read his autobiographies, \"Papillon\" and \"Banco\", seeing Henri Charriere in the flesh is the main reason to seek this movie out. The very fact that he went from escaping Devil's Island and then reinventing his life through some death-defying adventures, all the way up to a film-actor, is a feat to be admired. But this film is really shaky in almost every way. The story was written probably from his own experiences, dealing with diamond thieves in the South American jungles. It's really pretty standard fare, storywise, dealing basically with the theme of honor amongst thieves. Papillon/Charriere is one of several burglars who stage a daring theft from the steaming jungles, only to experience betrayal from one of their own. They pursue their betrayers and are themselves pursued. But the film maintains an unexpectedly slow pace for this type of movie, despite being basically a \"chase story\". You almost get the feeling that all of the actors are waiting nervously for Charriere to do something throughout the film, but he spends a lot of time sitting and thinking and smoking before answering questions, in a heavily-accented English. Charriere seems to have gotten a bit too comfortable by the time he made this film, looking a bit too portly to be taken seriously as a swashbuckling, fist-fighting burglar. The film also contains the typical countercultural themes of the time involving fear of aging, which was perhaps a bit of a marketing ploy to the audiences of the time. It seems a bit out of place in the overall story. Read Henri Charriere's two autobiographies first, then perhaps watch the Steve McQueen film-version of the first book, which was released only a few months before Charriere died . Only then will you maybe acquire the curiosity to see the man behind the amazing books. Otherwise you may fall asleep before the film is over.",
         "The fact that Henri Charriere, whose life was dramatized in \"Papillon\" with Steve McQueen in 1973, wrote the script for this caper film and also has a supporting role in it may make some people willing to check it out, mostly out of curiosity. But don't be fooled; it's an (initially) muddled, padded and unexpectedly unslick picture. Not even Claudia Cardinale in a low-cut dress can make it worth watching. (*1/2)",
         "Mildly enjoyable international caper, very typical of its period and mainly notable � if at all � for its eccentric setting (a South American diamond mining-town), casting (Henri Charriere of \"Papillon\" fame as the gang boss, Stanley Baker's graduating from criminal in ROBBERY [1967] to inspector and Claudia Cardinale as a beautiful but duplicitous chanteuse nicknamed \"Popsy Pop\") and plot situations (the film is as much about the diamond theft and subsequent chase as the settling of a score � of the romantic type � involving the three principals); equally to the fore, especially during the narrative's first half, is the vivid local color. Another Jean Herman film which often plays on late-night Italian TV but I've yet to catch is the gangster thriller FAREWELL, FRIEND (1968) which basically hinges on the potentially dynamic star combo of Alain Delon and Charles Bronson."
