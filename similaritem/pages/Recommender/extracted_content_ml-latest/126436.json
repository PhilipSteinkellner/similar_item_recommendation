         "I saw Kosmicheskii Reis with the 2006 DVD edition with English subtitles, entitled \"The Space Voyage\". This Russian edition had a new soundtrack to this silent film, which suited it very well. The special effects alone on this film will astound anyone who has seen American SF serials from the same period, such as Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. This 1930s speculation amazes with its accuracy of prediction. Everything from the look of the rocket ships, to the weightlessness scene, weighted boots for moon walks, etc. Even most Hollywood depictions of space travel from the 1950s were not this well produced. Kosmicheskii Reis is a must-have for any serious SF collection, if you can find it! Hopefully we will see a nice box set of early Soviet SF cinema some day. This gem deserves the kind of restoration treatment that Fritz Lang's Metropolis has received.",
         "Saturday, July 28, 7 & 8:30 p. m., Northwest Film Forum Taken from the printed page and splashed across the big screen, science fiction flourished in early cinema. Beginning with Georges Méliès' Le Voyage dans la lune (A Trip to the Moon 1902) and Gaston Velle's Voyage autour d'une étoile (A Voyage Around a Star 1906), moviegoers indulged in vicarious space flight for the price of a theater ticket. The People's Revolution became an inter-planetary struggle in Aelita: Queen of Mars (1924), and Metropolis (1927) envisioned a beautiful, terrifying utopian nightmare. A major link in the development of science fiction, Kosmicheskiy reys: Fantasticheskaya novella (Cosmic Voyage: Fantasy novella 1936) was produced as a silent film to enable the widest possible distribution within the Soviet Union. Director Vasili Zhuravlov wrote his first scenario involving exploration of the moon in 1924. In 1932 the Komsomol (Communist Union of Youth) requested the creation of youth oriented film as a primary goal of the industry. Zhuravlov re-visited his earlier idea, this time, with generous state support and the technical assistance of imminent scientific scholar Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. The resulting Mosfilm production utilized an extensive team of art directors, writers, technicians and actors to create an impressive blend of incredibly intricate miniature sets, and visually exhilarating, fast paced action in a propagandist but surprisingly unexpected story. Much of the scientific authenticity and accuracy of technological predictions were due to seventy-eight-year-old Tsiolkovsky's insistence on several points of theoretical realism used in the film. The Aleksandr Filimonov screenplay was based on Tsiolkovsky's novel Outside the Earth. Sadly, he died four months before the film's release. The story begins with a thorough examination of the massive Palace of the Soviets (an actual planned structure that was never built) and the Institute of Space Flight, surrounded by Moscow, circa 1946. Professor Pavel Ivanovich Sedikh (Sergei Komarov), who bears a strong resemblance to Tsiolkovsky, arrives and is greeted by Professor Karin (Vasili Kovrigin), the stuffy bureaucrat and administrator of the Institute. Sedikh is instructed not to interfere with the impending launch. The old man meets an admiring boy, Andryusha Orlov (Vassili Gaponenki) who conspires to help Sedikh pilot the flight with beautiful young Professor Marina (Ksenia Moskalenko, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Bridgette Helm), in place of the assigned cosmonauts. Just as the plan has succeeded the boy jumps through the closing door, becoming a last second stow-away. This symbolic casting would seem to represent the old guard, the image of Soviet vitality, and the future. So much for the modern woman of the proletariat, when Marina is seen on her hands and knees, scrubbing the floor of the spacecraft! Generous offerings of floral bouquets for the slightest cause and the nervous obsession over a pair of winter boots by the old professor's wife are cultural conventions a non-Russian audience might easily overlook. Cosmic Voyage enjoyed great popularity among all ages in January 1936. The British production of H. G. Wells' Things to Come, released one month later, used remarkably similar special effects, but as with Aelita, it pales in comparison to Zhuravlov's film. When party officials interpreted animated scenes of the cosmonauts hopping from place to place on the lunar surface as frivolous and contrary to the spirit of \"socialist realism,\" the film was abruptly pulled from circulation, the responsible animator's name was stricken from the credits, and Cosmic Voyage was virtually forgotten until a revival screening in 1984.",
         "The print of this incredibly rare Soviet space exploration film I saw came without translated title cards. Since I can't speak Russian, I'm judging this on a purely visual level. The basics of the storyline seem simple enough and the acting seems good enough (I've seen Fritz Lang's \"Woman in the Moon\", which seems to be a source of inspiration), but still, since I couldn't pick up on many of the characters and how developed or not they are, I could be wrong with any assessment in this department. Interestingly enough, since I wasn't weighed down by the storyline, the propaganda aspects seem all the more apparent. It makes me wonder if Sergei Eisenstein's films would be less subtle if I couldn't understand the story dynamics. The themes of workers cooperating in union to advance their cause seems to be the main theme of the story (when building up the rocket, no one ever seems to be in command of the final project). The main point of interest for me outside of the propaganda were the visuals. While primitive by today's standards, the special effects of weightlessness in space, the incorporation of animation, and especially several mind-blowing tracking shots were all incredibly advanced for their time. They often remind one of Georges Melies, the fantasy master of silent cinema. Even if you don't speak a lick of Russian, this may be compelling for its technical aspects. (7/10)",
         "Since Herr Georges Méliès visited the moon at the beginning of the last century, there have been many attempts to do likewise by other directors who were fascinated by the incredible space travel and bizarre landscapes and creatures that Herr Méliès showed in his masterpiece. However, this was not an easy task at all, as illustrated by the story of Herr Vasili Zhuravlyov who, because of political censorship, endured much frustration and many delays in sending a communist manned spaceship to the moon. He finally was able to make his dream come true in the late year of 1936 under the now extinct Stalinist U.S.S. R. Such a complicated space travel project is depicted powerfully in \"Komicheskiy Reys: Fantasticheskaya Novella\" ( \"Cosmic Journey\" ), a very interesting and inventive sci-fi film with special effects that are very different from those today but are still skillfully done. Herr Zhuravlyov does not let the propaganda background sink his artistic intentions, certainly a task-given the times-that may have been more difficult than actually sending someone to the moon. Obviously the political background can't be ignored in the film, so there are many communist references in it, the most significant being that the spacecraft that finally lands on the moon is called \"Josef Stalin\" and of course there is the film's message about the power and accomplishment of technical research in the U.S.S.R. but this is acceptable in terms of the story. The art direction and space imagery of the film is certainly astounding, including beautiful and imaginative décors and models, suggesting these supposedly futuristic times of the, Ahem� mid 40's of the last century. Especially remarkable is the travelling effect wherein the two U.S.R.R. spacecrafts are shown in detail in the hangar and of course the moon décors, showing a mysterious and deserted planet reminiscent of l Herr Méliès . The cosmonauts will have an extra and dangerous mission trying to send a radio message to the Earth ( well� it is more correct to say U.S.R.R. ) in order to let them known that finally the spacecraft has landed. There is also a big problem with the oxygen tank but there is a light side too as we see the cosmonauts walking on the moon (via animation), a sequence that gives the film an air of charming fantasy. \"Komicheskiy Reys�\" is a very imaginative oeuvre, a remarkable picture full of fantasy and imaginative technical resources, an excellent example of the space race between cinematographers. And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must moon around as usual. Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com"
