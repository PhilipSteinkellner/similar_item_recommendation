The short follows a group of righteous friends out to punish unsuspecting citizens who play into their hands. A good understanding of camera and symmetry is evident, which would be reaffirmed convincingly in Bang Bang. Tonacci comes from the world of Cinema Marginal, that attempted to walk opposite to Cinema Novo, and create something norm-breaking, logic-defying."],
