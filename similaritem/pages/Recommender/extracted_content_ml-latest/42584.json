      "synopsis": "Gianni, Antonio and Nicola were resistant during the war, sharing everything like brothers. After the war, they returned to their lives. Antonio as a nurse in a Roman hospital where he fell madly in love with a girl named Luciana. He also milits for the Popular Front. Gianni entered as an assistant a law firm who's head, La Rosa, is running as a deputy candidate for the Socialist Party. Nicola returned to teachnig in a small town high school, married a woman named Gabriella and had a child, Tommasino. He is an intellectual idealist, active member of the communist party, as well as a passionate film buff. The story begins three years after the war, as Antonio is lunching with Luciana in a restaurant when Gianni happens to pass by. Antonio is thrilled and he starts talking about the days they resistant life. Luciana and Gianni don't really listen to him, as they fall in love in silence with each others. Antonio sees nothing. A following night, Gianni and Luciana visit Antonio to his hospital to speak the truth about their affair. Antonio takes the news very calmly even though Luciana is everything to him. Gianni says he is sorry but cannot contain his feelings for her. Luciana tells Antonio she loves him, but says that with Gianni, \"it's different\". Sad about the two friends splitting over her, she insists that they remain friends. They don't answer but seem to agree. Luciana and Gianni leave until Antonio suddenly runs after them and kicks Gianni. He says he is not surprised by his friend betrayal, \"as you've exploited us for years already\", refering to Gianni's political incline. Around the same period, Nicola is loosing his teaching job after a violent argument with his superior about the movie Lattri di Biciclette (Vittorio de Sica, 1948). Her wife is despesparate, and asks him to apologize to get back his job, which he won't. He leaves wife and kid, gets to Roma with a case of books to find Antonio. Gianni and Luciana live happily and start to have family projects. Gianni is up the ladder, working for the firm as an lawyer. He is asked to defend in court a real estate constructor who found two of his employees dead on a site for not respecting security measures. Gianni refuses the case and the client tells him the office refusal is due to the own problems of the firm's head, La Rosa, now deputy who is accused of many political and financial misconducts. They are talking on the subject when Elide, the client's youngest daughter enters and falls in love instantly of Gianni. She leaves, and the client tries to bribe Gianni so he takes the case. Gianni doesn't accept nor refuses. Nicola tries to work in Rome as a film critic and attempts to start a magazine, \"Cine Culture\" but he fails everywhere. Years later, Antonio and Nicola are having lunch at their usual restaurant when Luciana enters. Antonio is not at ease. Nicola understands it is THE Luciana his friend was in love with but he insists into being introduced, which Antonio reluctantly does. They start talking and Luciana asks about Gianni, who she hasn't seen in a long time. The news fires Antonio's hopes. Later at night, the three of them are drunk and Nicola is playing a reconstitution on the stairs of Piazza di Espagna of the famous Stairs Scene from the Potemkine movie (Eisenstein, 1925), obviously trying to make Luciana laugh. Antonio is sitting alone, down the stairs, deep in his thoughts, smoking. He can't stand Nicola's game and argues with Luciana. She says she can do whatever she pleases, including becoming an actress. Antonio leaves, pissed, while Luciana hides in a photomaton and Nicola follows Antonio, trying to calm him down. He fails and returns to Luciana who has left the photomaton, leaving pictures of her where we see she has been crying warm tears. Years later, Gianni receives a letter from Nicola saying that Luciana has tried to commit suicide. He wonders why he, who has been away, receives such a letter, and why Nicola is sending it. He nevertheless goes to Luciana's. Luciana has tried a career on stage but has failed. She lives in a hotel room with other artists. Antonio is already there, nursing her. When Nicola comes back in, she asks him if he told Antonio about \"them\". Nicola slaps her. She tells that their two night story is over and apologizes to Antonio who starts a fight with Nicola, saying he took advantage of her. When Luciana is feeling better, they all leave the hotel, Luciana takes a bus and the two men go their separate ways in silence. Gianni is watching the scene from behind a news stand but cannot find the courage to confront his old friends. Years later, Gianni has married Elide, his client's daughter, he is now a rich and powerful lawyer with two children, Fabrizio and Donatella. They are partying for his client's 69th birthday. Elide tells Gianni how happy she is to be married with him and about that other life, she would have had, if he had married another woman. This flashes back Gianni to Luciana, his forgotten love. Gianni and Elide are having a family diner when they see Nicola on TV in a quizz show about Italian cinema. Antonio also happens to see the show from his ward. Nicola answers all the questions right and wins a considerable amount of money and the right to come back the following week on the show. He immediately calls his wife, with who he is reconciled. She advises that he takes the money without risking it at the next show. He claims his target is not the money but that his book \"Cinema as a school\" be published, which an editor promised to do if he won the grand prize of the show. Comes the next show. Nicola plays double or nothing, risking to loose all he has won. He is asked a question about Vittorio de Sica which he answers but his answer is deemed wrong by the jury. He complains but is expelled from the show, loosing the money. Antonio is still working in the hospital. A night, he is in an ambulance blocked by the shooting of the famous scene of the Trevi Fountain from La Dolce Vita (Frederico Fellini, 1960). He sees the movie's main actor and playboy, Marcello Mastroiani talking to an actress: Luciana. The ex lovers sit for a talk. Antonio is worry to see she has developed an alcoholic habit. As in love as the first day, he invites her for diner the next evening when her impressario comes in and says she is busy that evening. Antonio starts a fight. She asks not to see him again. A decade later, Gianni is a cold blooded businessman. He quarrels with his step father over a real estate project. They come to blows and the father sees he is too old and weak to stop Gianni. He gives him power to decide over the business. Antonio is living with a girl named Valeria. The couple is strolling in a public garden when they meet Luciana. She asks about Gianni, but he has no news from him. A kid come to talk to them, it is Luciana's son, Luigi. Antonio and Luciana start to see more each others, she works as a usher and lives alone with her kid. Gianni has a wonderful house in the contryside, where he can avoid his wife as much as he wants until one day, desesprate to talk to him, she catches him as he goes to work. She confesses that in her despair, she has met another man. He believes she makes the whole story up to upset him. Tired of the game, willing to prove her love, she takes her car, starts the engine and rush to her death. Nicola and a friend are at a festival where Vittorio De Sica is being interviewed. He tells the anecdote proving that Nicola was right in his answer to the show. This saddens Nicola. His friend tell him to go talk to De Sica, the model of all his life, but Nicola refuses, saying he has no more to say to him. He wanted to change the world, but the world has changed him. Antonio is driving into Rome when he sees Gianni. He goes to him, they awkwardly talk, realizing they haven't seen each others in some 25 years. Gianni pretends to be broke. They agree on meeting with Nicola, who is now a stringer for a newspaper. Gianni knows he won't go to the meeting but when he returns to his palace, he realizes it is all empty, his wife is dead, his children are gone, remains only his step father who won't die. Gianni realizes he is doomed and he decides to go to the meeting with his old friends. The three meet in the usual restaurant and talk joyfully about the past. Gianni breaks the good mood when he says they are a generation of bastards who did nothing to fulfill the hopes they had for a better world when the war ended. They blame each others policital views and fight again, drunk in the streets. When they stop, Nicola breaks into tears for what seems to be an acceptation of his failure. Instead, he reveals that his son is getting married, and that he actually cries for joy. They all take a car and go to Antonio's wife, who is Luciana. When Nicola and Gianni see her, they realize they both still have feelings for her. Gianni is left talking alone with Luciana and tells her that he kept being in love with her through all the years. She says she didn't think of him one bit. Gianni leaves while Nicola realizes he has the driving license of Gianni in his pocket. Morning, Nicola, Antonio and Luciana go to Gianni's house to see that he lied when he said he was broke. They leave the license at the door and leave, arguing with each others for nothing, like they did all their lives.",

         "I saw this film as a 20 year old when it just came out in the 70ies and I was fascinated by its vision, humor and tragedy. Now I saw it again, more than 25 years later. Living so to speak at the other end of the plot (the story begins when the four protagonists are around 20 and it ends in their late 40ies) it does not look worn out a bit. The way life constructs and destroys friendship has not been mirrored more intensely in any other film I've ever seen.",
         "Director Ettore Scola weaves a sensitive comedy-drama about the friendship of three men and the one woman each has loved. The men meet each other near the end of the Nazi occupation of Italy. As the next thirty years pass they remain friends although their lives take very different paths and become tinged with sadness and regret. The woman who pops in and out of their lives is Luciana (Stefania Sandrelli), an aspiring actress whose career peaks when she is cast as an extra in a Fellini movie. The three perennial friends are played by Vittorio Gassman, Nino Manfredi and Stefano Satta Flores. Veteran actor Aldo Fabrizi (the priest in OPEN CITY) does a remarkable turn as a powerful industrialist who is as grotesquely unlikeable as he is grotesquely corpulent. Film buffs will enjoy the way Scola has cleverly included footage of DeSica's THE BICYCLE THIEF along with scenes of De Sica explicating that famous movie of his. They will also enjoy a funny re-creation of the filming of the Trevi fountain scene from LA DOLCE VITA, complete with Marcello Mastroianni and Federico Fellini. This is a very beautiful film about how individuals and society change over the years while friendship, \"amicizia\", remains an enduring value.",
         "A great movie by a great director in a unique creative state of grace. Some of the scenes are pure poetry: the sudden change from b/w to colour picture (underlined by a moving music score), the dramatic conclusion of a night out in Piazza di Spagna, the overall feeling of nostalgia permeating the entire movie. Yes, this is a movie that will age like good wine. You can grow old with this movie, watch out not be caught too much into its spires of nostalgia. Just glance at Vittorio Gassman last, defeated, cynical look in his face, here the actor and the man are one and the same. The rest of the cast are just as effective and well sorted, nothing is out of place, the synergy between Manfredi, Satta-Flores, Sandrelli, and the great Aldo Fabrizi will keep you enthralled. Simply cinematographic art at its best.",
         "This is a beautiful film about friendship and nostalgia, but above all about loving cinema. To me, this film defines \"cinephilia\". Cinema and the protagonists' lives are cleverly interwoven. The fleeting images of film, capturing a moment and then disappearing, only to linger in the memory, can be seen as a metaphor for the past that can not be recaptured, a past when we were young and happy and confident and the world was ours. When the credits roll, I feel this strange mixture of happiness and sadness. Oh, how I wish...",
         "Sorry for being much too lenient but in these perverse times where everybody is talking of global warming, please excuse me when I say that I just have wonderful praises for this great film. It is great on every front. What is the yardstick by which a great film can be measured ? A great film can be recognized by its inherent ability to make viewers shed some emotional tears and weep inconsolably. This is what this great masterpiece by Ettore Scola did to me. We all loved each other is such a pleasant film that it can be compared to a sweet lullaby. The ease with which the various dramatic events happen is a joy to behold. I am not really sure about this fact but I think that may be French master Claude Sautet must have been influenced by this film when he decided to make a similar masterpiece called \"Vincent, François, Paul et les autres\".Which one is the better film ? Watch both of them and find out for yourself.",
         "I saw this movie many years ago on television. The imagery and the relationship amongst the characters was so interesting and involving I couldn't blink. This story evolves around the friendship of three men and a woman they each have loved. Life will teach us and destroy us, but our friendship will always endure. The three Italian men became friends during WWII. Although they remained friends they each took different career interests which led them to grow apart only to have their reunions spawn occasionally over the years. The woman friend is somewhat loose and not regarded favorably as a quality person, but rather as a slut. The theme here is time. Time determines how life will have formed their personalities, goals and dreams. Unfortunately all there dreams fall short and facing each other afterward is anticlimactic and depressing. By the end we are left with a feeling of sadness, cynicism, but a true account of how friendship and familial relationships come and fade. Life will be most cruel to the ones who are eager and sincere and the others will float through easily and unaffectedly. This is a cinematic masterpiece. It's a shame no one has revived it yet.",
         "My only all-time favorite, ever since 1979 in Tuschinski. The theme is simple, strong and light, and does not evoke grand historical events but a mere musing on one's own growing up. The use of black/white and sepia flashbacks, changing into into present day colors at a sidewalk drawing, give extra depth to past and present with only a few stroke of the brush. Extra attention has been devoted to sounds and melody: the voices of the main characters reinforce the roles. The melody theme is played simply on one trumpet and echoes the simplicity of the theme. The memory of the move does not fade even after 25 years. I guess it was intended to do so. A very natural composition.",
         "\"We All Loved Each Other So Much\" (Italian, 1974): A film by Ettore Scola. We follow three men-friends through 30 years - weaving in and out of each others their lives, alone or in various combinations, with one particular woman. They met as \"brothers in war\" during the Italian Resistance of WWII. With eventual peace, each traveled their own paths, crossing and remeeting every so often. The b/w photography is beautiful, the scoring perhaps a little heavy-handed (but considering the time � 1974 � downright subtle), the period \"looks\" seems accurate enough, and the acting by all involved is good. I enjoyed some of the film's devices, such as all the actors freezing in position and the one \"in thought\" getting a spotlight, the occasional near-repeat of a scene/incident, the actors sometimes speaking directly to you, and other breaks with the \"reality\" of a film. No doubt Woody Allen saw this work before his making \"Annie Hall\". You might also think of this film as a more somber, sophisticated version of \"The Big Chill\" with fewer main characters and more internal assessment.",
         "When nostalgia meets subtle humor, nonchalance and Italian \"bigmouth\"-way of expressing ideas, there's where you can find \"C'eravamo tanto amati\". The emotion is always there, but the smile is never far away.Italian filmmakers (not all, but Scola is definitely one of them)have this lovely way to make sad things seem quite funny (apart of one or two very touching scenes), and funny things a bit melancholic. This film talks to your heart. It appeals to a wide range of emotions, each of them never alone but delicately mixed with others. This story about love, friendship, political involvement, and their evolution (dilution?) through the years could have easily lost itself in drama and self-pity, or in first-degree optimism, which are the two great traps which lots of directors fall in. But Scola is far, far above that. This film is life as it goes. Special mentions to the scenes between Vittorio Gassmann and Giovanna Ralli.",
         "When 3 former Partizan(Italian guerrilla against the Nazis forces in the Second War World)and friends tear apart when the great war was over,their destiny flow in different ways,while Antonio(Nino Manfredi)and Nicola (Steffano Satta)only survive with underpaid work,Gianni Perago(a huge Vittorio Gassman)an average lawyer gets success when he marries Helade,the dummied daughter of a Count and Commendatore(such as a Governator to the American people)called Romulo Catenacci one rich elder,and Gianni handles the business of his father-in-law,allowing him to get a comfortable way of life,Luciana(Stefania Sandrelli)was fired by Gianni after she left Antonio,and her career as actress gets a relative success,when Antonio met her again,she had made a new life with another guy,in the final scene Luciana,Antonio and Nicola discover the new brand life of Gianni,and they came away when it was obvious.Gianni deceive them because he turned a haughty and greedy guy,but without who is ashamed of who,Scola left us with that final doubt. Great movie indeed,maybe the lapses of time could be not so clear and the ending was not so worked out,but if it had happened this movie would be perfect!,to name extraordinary cameos as Marcelo Mastroianni plus the genial Federico Fellini and in the celluloid Vittorio De Sica and his masterpiece \"The Bicycle Thief\",another underrated movie in this link,Perhaps Are crappy films as \"Batman Begins\" or the overvalued \"Pulp Fiction\"(What a filthy scene of rap ism against that black guy!)superior than that jewel?I would ask for all the American people to watch more foreign movies with quality and without CGI,FX neither PC special effects banging your head. This movie can show about the value of the friendship,love,thankfulness but in this material world those stuffs matter less than any special effect of the \"Green Screen\",open your eyes to end up such mistake. \"We wanted to change the World,rather the world changed us\" an amazing phrase told by Nicola,it's to never forget. Watch more good movie,less junkie virtual reality!"
