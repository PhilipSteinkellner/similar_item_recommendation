         "This movie is so unique, it may be as difficult for some to understand as it is to figure out Pootie's language. I was captivated from the first scene right up to the end. Kudos to Lance Crouther for his truly inspired performance as the hero. His physical comedy while combatting his foes or even just interacting with everyone else was brilliant and quirky. You really find yourself focusing on him in every scene, just to see what he was going to do next. There is also the ensemble of actors that inhabit Pootie's world, all of whom did a great job. I often read critics making comparisons between the modern charactor actors and how they pale before those of the distant past - razzz - wrong! These people hammed it up with style and flair. \"I'm Dirty Dee, dammit!\" Sah da tay, my brothers.",
         "8/10 for a little movie I had never heard of before today that I now see has a shockingly low IMDb score? Have my few braincells finally left my heavy skull or does this movie deserve to be seen by more people? I opt for the latter. Pootie Tang is all about . . . . . Pootie Tang (played by Lance Crouther), a man who men want to be and women want to be with. He's a recording artist, an actor, an inspiration to children everywhere and a thorn in the side of evil corporate America. And he does all this with the aid of his powerful belt, bestowed upon him from his father's (Chris Rock, in one of a few roles he plays) deathbed. Of course, everyone likes to see the mighty fall and this is precisely what some nasty folk have in mind for Pootie Tang so the movie chronicles his early years, his amazing status in modern times and his fall from grace as evil businessmen try to gain and profit from his image. Lance Crouther is great in the leading role, all nonsensical talk and smooth charm, and the rest of the cast are all pretty uniformly hilarious. Yes, the bigger names like Chris Rock, Wanda Sykes and Jennifer Coolidge get more time to wring laughs but everyone involved plays their part to perfection, getting maximum comedy value from even the smallest of dumb gags. Writer/director Louis C.K. has crafted a little gem of a film that really deserves a far bigger audience and while it could be accused of being little more than a parody pastiche it becomes more than the sum of it's parts thanks to some spot-on humour, excellent performances and a marvellously wacky sensibility. Seek it out and you won't be disappointed. See this if you like: Undercover Brother, Fear Of A Black Hat, Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood.",
         "It's criminal, how underrated this movie is. It's inspired on so many levels, and the encyclopedic knowledge of action films, hip-hop videos, 70s blaxploitation and chop-socky movies is breathtaking. I always think of it in the same class as THE JERK and ZOOLANDER, with a healthy respect for flat-out absurdity and non-stop gags. The filming style is rough, and the actors generally have no polish (an undoubtedly deliberate choice), which makes the sudden flashes of precision so devastatingly funny. Wanda Sykes, in particular, is absolute gold as party girl Biggie Shorty, but the film's full of co-stars - Andy Richter, Dave Attell, Jennifer Coolidge, J.D. Williams, Missy Elliott, and Robert Vaughan - who get their turn on the silliness carousel. I can imagine someone who isn't a fan, or at least an observer, of the above things would hate this movie like poison, but for me, who has seen more Jay-Z videos than I ever wanted to see and who can't help laughing when I see a man use kung-fu to bounce bullets off his hair (a gag too complicated to explain, but seamless on screen), POOTIE TANG is fantastic. I'd recommend it more, but it's just too hard to describe!",
         "First time I saw a scene of it on cable here in Brazil I could understand a single word! Then I start to pay attention on them and also on the translation. It was doubled funny to me! The words in English are completely crazy and in Portuguese even craziest! I could barely see the rest of the movie because I could not stop laughing!! If you just want fun: go ahead!",
         "\"Pootie Tang\" is the ultimate guilty pleasure film. Sometimes I ask myself, \"why do I laugh at this?\". I don't know why, but it funny as hell. Chris Rock is a genius. I don't know how you come up with a story about a funny talking super hero. Throughout the whole movie, this guy is saying things that doesn't make any sense, but the characters surrounding him all understand. How do you come up something like that?!? And put it into a feature film!!! One liners like \"sa da tay\" and \"sine your pity on the runny kine\", are classics. \"Pootie Tang\" was conceived on the HBO hit The Chris Rock Show, in this spin off movie, Pootie is trying to take all the junk food, drugs and alcohol off the street that is being distributed by Dick Lecter (Robert Vaughn). The supporting cast includes The Chris Rock Show regulars including Wanda Sykes. \"Pootie Tang\" seems like a send up to 70's blaxpoitation films, but at the same time, I don't know what it is. \"Pootie Tang\" is a mixed bag of funk music, cheesy action and comedy. It all works for \"Pootie Tang\" making it the most unusual film ever made. Pootie Tang- rated PG-13 *** out of ****",
         "Just to let the world know---if ya ain't seen Pootie Tang in it's full glory it's time to get your business in order!!! This movie is absolutely one of the funniest, most hilarious, idiotic masterpieces that I have had the opportunity to view. If ya like the kind of stuff ya can laugh at for no reason at all (except that it's funny) then you need to rent it, invite over your friends who are non-believers and do the doggone thing!!! A lot of my own friends here in the great city of Detroit have doubts about my precious Pootie but I am so going to erase all of their fears of letting loose-cause that's exactly what you do when you are all in like me. Chris Rock absolutely needs to do a sequel and I think it should be called,\"POOTIE TANGING JR.\" Now how's that for devotion! Pootie--I love you and I always will!! Somebody please tell Chris Rock that we NEED some mo' Pootie Tang in our lives!!!",
         "For those of you that don't get it, leave it alone. This is about fantasy, fun and escapism. Its meant to take you away from reality and make you laugh and it does just that. The acting was not meant to win awards or come close. It is supposed to be fun. I love it! Don't hate cause you don't have it going on like Pootie Tang (LOL). All these men wish they could whip another man's butt with their belts and have all the women slobbering all over them without even having to speak! Biggie Shortie is doing it! I think it was very creative. Its easy to do something that everyone else is trying to do. This and Half-Baked are classics",
         "It's easy to pick out what people would object to in this movie. It really is little more than a sketch comedy bit extended to 80 minutes, it really only has one joke and it really is pure silliness. But I thought it was really funny. Some of it, like Pootie's defending himself with his braid, was even brilliantly silly. Having seen it three days ago, I have already forgotten virtually the entire movie, but I thoroughly enjoyed it at the time, and my girlfriend, who is less tolerant of pure silliness than I am, laughed throughout. It did run out of momentum a little as it went along, with a great first half hour followed by diminishing returns on that one joke, but there was enough fun through to keep us watching. 7/10",
         "I'm not saying that Pootie Tang will be for everyone, but for those interested, it is really a gas. Pootie Tang was originated on Chris Rock's HBO show with Crouther playing Tang as the new president elect Pootie Tang telling his campaign in lingo that almost no one could understand but it was still dead pan. Now, he has a movie. Lance Crouther plays the title character in a short yet entertaining movie about a hero with a belt that helps him against the forces of evil, plus his gift of saying things that have no meaning whatsoever (like ebonics mixed with down syndrome, but it's funny). Chris Rock (in 3 equally hilarious roles), Robert Vaughn and Wanda Sykes also star in this movie with it's only damaging flaw being that after a while it runs out of steam. Worth a look. B+",
         "I'm more into classic drama and the epic scene, but when I do get into a comedy it has to be absolutely senseless. I don't want to see any formulaic structure from the drama side of things crossing over - which a lot of Holly-comedies have - it has to take on its own form and the Chris Rock produced \"Tang\" does that. The cheese fact is a perfect 10 on the scale and the creative powers that be told this story with precision. I believe this will be a cult classic, not to mention it far out played \"Undercover Brother\" which was released on a healthier production and marketing budget that same year. Chris Rock should be proud of his producer role and Lance Crouther was the funniest black-man stereotype I've ever seen. Finally, I remember going to a Blockbuster a few years back with some friends to buy the DVD, it was such a cult hit that some kid had stole the disk and left the DVD jacket on the for sale shelf... That says something. True stupidity is an acquired taste which only few can actually understand. And I would bet a few Franks that comedic geniuses are serious people 90 percent of the time. But when they let loose, look out."
