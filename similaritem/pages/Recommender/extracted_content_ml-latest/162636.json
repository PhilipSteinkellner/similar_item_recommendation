         "Arisan! arrived when public had become jaded with Indonesian films. After a string of trashy horror and fluffy teen flicks, Arisan! came as an adult-oriented drama/comedy which bravely tackled issues never before seen in Indonesian cinema: the lives of upper-class people and gays and succeeded in both attempts. The film would have been ordinary if not for the well-written script which shows wit, intelligent, and honesty. This is a work from the heart. Considered as the best Indonesian film ever made and arguably so. Indonesian native speakers will agree that the dialogs are wonderful and sounds very real, unlike ALL Indonesian films which speaks like textbook. Not without flaws (the editing feels choppy at times) but the script manages to sidesteps all clichés.",
         "Arisan! is telling us about three people whose befriend since their in high school. Now, in their thirty something age, they are supposedly mature enough to gain their own personal life. They are good looking, success, rich and happy, or aren't they? Memey (Cut Mini) is a successful business woman and marrying a handsome and successful husband. Her friend Sakti (Tora Sudiro) is her co-worker and state as an eligible bachelor. Meanwhile Andien (Aida Nurmala) is a devoted housewife to her twice older husband and her children. Their life seems perfect, until when they join a social gathering call Arisan, their secret is unfolded and their friendship is at a risk. Arisan! is a satire about \"A\" class society and hypocritical that used to veil their life. The direction form Nia DiNata is a first class. The plot is build well and the progress of the characters development is stunning. Both comedy and drama are sufficient enough and the photography is subtle and contributing much for the whole film. The mood is constant on the track to make this a truly winner, both as an entertain package and social critique. The one thing nuisance me that Arisan! is running on a slow pace, but at least it doesn't make a big bother. If you just looking for a simple entertainer, you may think twice to watch Arisan!, but is very recommended to whose want to enjoy a good picture with quality and absolutely not a B-rate movie. 9/10",
         "ARISAN (The Gathering) is a fine little story about the ins and outs of Jakarta's wealthy class - sort of an Indonesian Beverly Hills 90210/Melrose Place sitcom. The characters include frustrated wives, jealous wives, career women, cheating husbands, man-hunter girls, and two gay men - one closeted and one open. The film explores the social dictates of society and the jumbled events that occur when family or friends try to match make. The cast is young and attractive and handles the material well. The problem with the film is the emphasis on clothes, fancy homes, cars, and all the trappings of the wealthy class. An 'arisan' is a gathering where friends come together, pitch in $100. each and pass the hostessing around to various locales where their main conversation is fairly shallow gossiping. But this film, though drowning in the over-the-top trappings, has many sensitive issues well discussed and played. For a film from Indonesia it is a terrific change from the usual horror flicks that originate from their studios and as such bodes well for a new movie industry that obviously has the ability to become important. It is funny, tender, very colorful and entertaining: some judicious editing could have pared this overly long movie into a fine little film. In Indonesian and English with subtitles. Grady Harp",
         "It's hard to find Indonesian film that could make me come back for second time to watch it. But it's different. Director Nia Dinata did great work.One subject that I enjoyed most were dialogues....different than many indonesian cinema, very daily style. Actually it's not new idea but it happened in a muslim country and focus on three best friends lives, but the center of this story are about being gay and Tora Sudiro played as good as he can. He deserve to get my TWO THUMBS UP and more,represented as some gay men did. As usual gay style show us sissy and freak and ridiculous people. we can't find easily gay men on cinema as good man as part of the society. But it did.Arisan is one of good movie I ve ever seen, please don't compare with brilliant Hollywood cinema,okay...",
         "The only worthy Indonesian movie to watch this year. The first Kalyana movie that actually works! Great! And to picture gay story in Indonesia is quite risky, but this movie dare to do that. Even though gay story is only one of the three stories brought by the three main characters, it's the strongest one. The other two problems about adultery and compulsory to breed children felt like accessories to it. The way they use 'arisan' as the most common Indonesian tradition among housewives is smart and reflects so many 'Indonesian' things. You can see many things in Indonesia in this movie which are told honestly. And they do it well, reminds me of how chocolate in 'Chocolate' brought the story. Well done!",
         "Exiting times in Indonesia! two Indonesian films defeate the 3rd movie in 'The Matrix' Trilogy. But the one that everyone's eyes are at is 'Arisan!'. 3 Close friends live a normal life, that is, at first look. After a while we see them strugle with unhappiness in different forms. Meimei hears from her Doctor that she won't be able to become pregnant and sees her husband run away. Andien's husband slept with someone else, and Sakti -who is gay- is afraid that his mother or best friend Meimei might find out that he is. Well, she finds out, but in a way he never imagined she would. This film is the first BIG HIT in Indonesia where it is all about 'coming out'. Sakti and Nino will learn that in modern Indonesia, being gay is as normal as in other countries (far from the reality, but common in some areas of Indonesia). Screaming girls in the cinema when Sakti and Nino first kiss. No sensor in Indosia, and that is surprising!! Over all, this film is not only good because it doesn't show any stereo type Indonesian gays (mostly transsexuals or overacting feminate gays), but two people like everone else. It is also a film technically quite good, although the editing could have been better. Two thumbs up for Arisan!",
         "The life of hedonism people in big city like Jakarta always fill with brand minded,Sex after lunch and dirty talk.When all the housewives,career women and young mommy are being together,everything is all about something \"adult material contents\".In ARisan!Nia Dinata discover all of it.The Honest,The truth and the reality.Things that never been thought before,nowadays just become \"the usual behavior\" of socialite high-class mothers and women.The great,exceptional and smart directing by NYU alumni Nia Dinata made this one as the best and most favourite comedy-drama ever.Even this movie got award for \"the best movie of 2004\" by FFI(Indonesian Film Festival).Cut Mini Theo showed her great talented as Memey,a confusing career smart woman.Tora Sudiro gave his stunning and incredible performance as Sakti,A gay city worker.And Aida Nurmala seems looks so unbelievable-excellent act ever played by newcomer as Andien,a desperate glamour housewife.However,Whenever and Whatever the days you'll be through it,spend your time for a while to watch this movie.Cause,It's the most important movie of all time.It's about city life,It's about socialite and it's about you...I give grade 10 of 10.Viva Arisan!",
         "Witty,fresh,very daily style... Represented some indonesian life style....in some spots....But two thumbs up for this first gay themed with kissing scene.Especially if we think about muslim majority people.Two thumbs up for Director Nia Dinata and Tora Sudiro who played as gay man, Good work you guys",
         "Other than the actors \"sometimes\" talks stuttered, & a \"not so good\" sound (especially when the actor \"Surya Saputra\" talking, cos he's lips looked barely moved, I really couldn't understand What he was saying, thank God, before I bought the VCD, I already saw it in the theater) It's refreshing to have a well made movie from Indonesia,& an added bonus cos it has a clever dialog that you don't see in other \"cliche\" Indonesian movie. It also break the Dogma that a good Indonesian movies, is the one with a traditional, classical artsy movie, with a longgggggggg dialog & scene. Don't get me wrong, I still like those kind of movies, but sometimes the Director is a bit selfish, to make movie that only good in visual & difficult dialog but not enjoyable for the audiences. Plizzzz, Indonesian film maker, make more movies like this.",
         "well, i read the review before i write this comment. as an indonesian, i perfectly understand every single little joke in this movie. and i think this movie is quite hilarious. i watch it over and over again. i love surya saputra since around 1995. and he is a good actor (and singer). and tora sudiro is a brand new star. i love him in it. and i'm waiting for his upcoming projects, if there is any. cut mini, i thought she only does comedy stuffs. but she proved that she could act well in a serious role. rachel maryam, thumbs up for that gal. for the storyline, picture, dialog and everything. conclusion, this is the best indonesian movie i've ever seen.",
         "Whoa! Being born and raised in Jakarta, Indonesia, I am really impressed with how the Indonesian cinema industry has progressed! Especially since this is the first gay-theme movie coming from the largest Muslim country in the world, and the first Indonesian film to use high-def color enhancement. Like most Indonesians, I can totally relate to all aspects that are presented in this movie in addition to the honest, great sense of humor. What I like about the director, Nia Dinata, is that not only she tries to show a true reflection of Jakarta's elites, but also the ongoing problems that still exist such as the wealth gap, high crime rates and prostitution, as well as drug abuse. Nonetheless, the movie is very colorful, tastefully done, and has a good story flow. Congrats Nia!",
         "a fresh & clever movie, finally some good screen adaptation on the wealthy indonesian pop culture life style, this movie is in some way light on the outside but heavy on the inside has an entertaining & intelligent shape all in one, a wake up call for the indonesian film and especially soap opera industry that the theme of entertainment for the people is rising to a higher level of standards. what amazed me is this film still taste & feel ( in a ethical philosophical way) indonesian not abducted like janji jony which doesn't taste indonesian, so the concept of arisan is indonesianized of American not the other way around, which in the day ahead creates its own special tone for the indonesian movies industry, that point i think deserves a respect bravo.., Ms nia dinata you have done an exiting breakthrough trough your innovative well crafted quality movie, that i hope will stimulate the birth of another high creativity & intellect movies in the near future, salute..... \"No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world\" john keating, death poet society",
         "Hello all--for what it's worth, I'm in a doctoral program on Indonesian politics and returned this semester after about a year's fieldwork, most of it in Jakarta. I'm a big movie fan generally, so I went out as often as I could, and bought tons of local VCDs while I was there. This one I saw in the theater, since it opened while I was there, and, thankfully, closed soon after. Who was the intended audience for this film? The spoiled wives and daughters of the Indonesian super-elite whose antics are weakly and ineffectively parodied? The vast majority of Indonesians who could never afford even a single dish, let alone a full meal, in the film's central restaurant location? Or gay Indonesian males, whose dilemma in the country's Muslim-dominated society is reduced to absurdly simplistic, how-to-respect-yourself preaching. If all this wasn't bad enough, the soundtrack was either recorded or mixed so ineptly that even native-speaking Indonesians couldn't hear many of the lines. In brief, if you're looking for a cutting-edge gay-themed film from a region of the world that seems among the least likely to produce such an animal, forget it. \"Westler\" from the early '80s, or \"My Beautiful Laundrette,\" from the same era, succeed far better in putting a happier face on dealing with homophobia, and do so by showing not telling through incessant, wordy scenes. Overall, an unfortunate waste of money in a country that still can't educate all of its children nor keep them healthy.",
         "Finally, a great new Indonesian film. I like it because the script is so smart, and funny also. We haven't seen such a good story after many years (like Nagabonar, Kejarlah Daku Kau Kutangkap, and several good film in the past). So, congratulation to Joko Anwar and Nia Dinata. Good Job! The problem is: I think we have to understand indonesian culture if we want to enjoy the whole film, don't we?",
         "This is the first Indonesian movie that I've seen. Bravo is highly presented for the production house that produces this film. As the first Indonesian movie that started to capture the other side of Indonesian Gay life. Though not actually can be map to the real Gay life; cause I cannot found such kind romantic Gay life in me. Funny, loud of laugh also appeared here. Bravo.",
         "Perhaps I was disappointed because this movie was described as an architect in Indonesia struggling with his homosexuality. There were way too many subplots and other characters. For example, he was so concerned his mother would find out, but you barely see his mother in this movie. Another thing which seemed illogical, they kiss on the cheek after the architect is gone for a week in London, but are passionate when Meimei is hiding behind a wall with a birthday cake. (how did she get in the apartment in the first place?) I did not want explicit nudity nor was I expecting that, but this was a terribly long movie about too many people for two guys to kiss twice and hug twice. I would have at least expected a full on shot of the main character with his shirt off. Overall, perhaps since I don't understand Indonesian culture, maybe there were some jokes I didn't understand - it was entertaining and original. I did like the originality part and the fact that all people were just portrayed as normal except possibly the Japanese photographer was a bit too swishy. This gets my recommendation if you like all things Gay oriented and want something to do for an afternoon, but as described, this movie was not satisfying."
