         "This movie won't win any awards or anything, but as far as \"Beach Party\" comedy films go it's really good, and yes there is actually a plot! It never takes itself too seriously whilst poking fun of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and even has a short joke about it being a movie and the fashions would be out of date by it's release! Someone who only watches epic movies that win major awards probably will not enjoy this, but if you were a teenager growing up in the late 1980's or early 1990's then you'll probably really like this! Interesting to note that this has been released on DVD from Platinum Disc Corporation but seems like it's really hard to find already! Luckily i snagged a copy real cheap. =)",
         "This film has only one goal and that is to make you wish you had gone to Spring Break in the late 80s/early 90s in Lauderdale. It succeeds admirably. Tim and Dave are two regular guys who find themselves mixed up in a search for a missing heiress. They must find the Delta Pi with the rose-shaped birth mark or lose the prize of 300 million dollars. But what about their new girlfriends? Which will they choose: Money or love? The film isn't Citizen Cane and doesn't try to be. It's full of \"hey we're in a movie\" jokes and nudity and a soundtrack by a cool band that some how ends up in almost every scene. I also love the fact that when the private eye (the sexy Blake Pickett)tells them who the missing girl's famous father is they recognize his name: Example \"She's the daughter of Steven Stratta\" \"The skate board kid?\" \"Yes\" Everyone in the movie knows that this dude is \"the skateboard kid\". Anyways, the film has a neat surfer rock soundtrack and tons of T&A and a lot of clubs that are now closed down.",
         "David and Tim are two best friends on their way to Fort Lauderdale when they meet two beautiful girls, make some very nasty enemies, and join a private detective service. They must find a Delta who is to inherit a fortune while at the same time keeping up appearances with their girlfriends and dodging the bad guys. A satisfying final product for a plot with too many limitations. A would-be teen pleaser without any sort of following and only a low budget appeal. Guys will enjoy some gratuitous female nudity and surfers will dig the music. Throw Golden Globes away because this one wasn't up for any awards.",
         "You're probably not likely to think of that after watching this classic, but it is entertaining. Two guys like to party, looking for sex stumble upon a great mystery. Of course, to solve the mystery they have to watch college girls undress and sleep with a few. I'll leave the super surprise ending for you to figure out. This movie is now for sale on Amazon, for those of you that have been searching. My life is now complete."
