         "Frank Henenlotter's 'Brain Damage' (1987) is easily the director's best film, esp. when considering the solid performances, technical proficiency and fascinating storyline. Aylmer, a rather large, penis-shaped parasite, gives unsuspecting Brian brain damage by getting him hooked on an hallucinogenic, blue fluid that Aylmer himself produces. Oh, the colors! But the thousand-year-old worm-like parasite demands something in return for the buzz - human brains! Aylmer and his actions seem to be a metaphor for drug use and addiction and convey very graphically how substances foreign to our bodies can alter our own thoughts and actions. Henenlotter adds context and meaning to the proceedings by creating a history for Aylmer. The parasite was sold and stolen over the centuries, until it finally ended up in the possession of Brian's neighbors. But the neighbors deprived Aylmer of his needs in order to keep him weak, and that's where the story begins. Henenlotter's films are never without heavy doses of sick humor, and the perverse highlight here is a sequence depicting a disco-whore getting her brains screwed out - literally - through her mouth. If that's not enough, the special effects in the restaurant scene, complete with spaghetti and brainballs, are particularly polished and satisfying. Ultimately, the director outplays his hand and is left with nowhere to go. Despite this weak ending, 'Brain Damage' is an odd, effective story and film, a major step up from the director's debut, 'Basket Case', but every bit as twisted. >",
         "This is one of my alltime favorites of the horror genre! A great movie to watch. What i like about this movie is the underlying drug related messages throughout. It's like watching requiem for a dream almost in that drug-related sense. I don't need to tell much about the plot, since i'm sure many have already explained it. I am a hardcore horror fan through and through, and i will just say that this movie rocks. It's got a great and interesting story, some awesome gore scenes and some hilarious comedy as well. It's not scary, but it is a gory, funny, bizarre, and original movie that isn't even close to being like anything else out there...you gotta see it to believe it. 10 out of 10 (based on a horror fan's review)",
         "Brain Damage is the greatest anti-drug horror/comedy. Well, probably the only one. This is Frank Henenlotter's crowning achievement. If you like his Basketcase trilogy, who cares? This is way better than those movies. This movie actually has a message: Don't trust little phallic-like aliens named Aylmer. Just kidding. The anti-drug theme is played heavily throughout the movie. If you're a genre buff or if your sense of humor is as perverted as mine, then do not miss this film. It should be a considered a classic low budget horror movie but it seems that it's rather unheard of. And that is a sad thing. Frank Henenlotter...where are you? Note for genre buffs: Look out for the man with the wicker basket on the subway. That's Kevin Van Hentenryck from the Basket Case films.",
         "you know, i just went to see House of Wax the other day, and ten years after scream came out why are the same boring plots with the same boring characters doing the same stupid mistakes our only option for horror these days. i suggest going back 20 years to the 70's and 80's if you want to find some great horror. horror then was low budget but imaginative. the movies had interesting story lines and were not shy about blood and gore. a good stepping stone for this sub-genre is one of my current favorites, Brain Damage. It starts off on a very surreal note, but mixes its strangeness with an accurate portrayal of a young man hopelessly addicted to the mother of all drugs. his dealer is perhaps the most unique little monster in all of horror, Aylmer (pronounced \"elmer\"). Aylmer is a purple cucumber shaped alien with a tiny smiling face and a soft warm voice. he finds a host, and injects his host with a blue liquid that comes out of one of Aylmer's fangs. this \"brain juice\" jacks up its host into a hullucionary state. while the host is in la-la land, Aylmer makes a victim of whoever the host comes in contact with, eating the victims brains. as vile as all that sounds, it is hard to see Aylmer as evil. he is just such a nice little guy. plus he is unique in his appearance, personality, and attacks, which all go a long way with me in a modern world of horror villains pushed off an assembly line. this movie is not winning an Oscar. it is strange and campy and violent. but if that is what you desire in a film, this hidden gem may become one of your favorites!",
         "From the director of BASKET CASE comes his second feature, and this one's his best. And we also get a Collector's Edition DVD from Synapse with a couple of extra goodies. There's a parasite loose in an apartment building named 'Elmer' who infects a guy named Brian (Rick Herbst) and addicts him to his blue 'juice'. In order to get more juice, Brian has to bring Elmer some more brains to eat. Elmer even smiles and sings in the bathroom sink. What a cute little turd. (laughs) He's so detestably obnoxious that I can't help but like the little b***ard. It's kinda neat that when Brian brings Elmer out, he attacks people by latching onto their foreheads and burrowing into his victims skulls and eating out their brains with what looks like a long straw. Most of the jerks Elmer does this to, deserve it anyway. This collector's edition DVD restores the long censored fellatio scene where Elmer pops out of Brian's pants and goes down the prostitute's mouth. And when Elmer's done eating, big hunks of gray matter come popping out of the hooker's mouth. It's a riot! And there's also the scene where Brian hallucinates during his withdrawal from Elmer's blue 'juice' and imagines pulling a string of tissue out his ear until his ear pops out and the side of his head gushes blood. Cool gore scene. The Synapse DVD uses an excellent wide-screen print with a great 80s synth soundtrack that includes the song, \"Corruption\" by The Swimming Pool Qs. Not at all like the crummy, muddy-looking censored VHS tape from a few years back. The only drawback is that there aren't many extras beyond a very interesting separate audio track commentary by director Henenlotter, and a movie trailer for the film. It's an all out classic in my book. Watch it! Get it! 8 out of 10",
         "In the overall mainstream horror business of the 80's, the few movies directed by Frank Henenlotter were an absolute relief and a breath of fresh air. His movies are weird tales that take place in dark and depressive surroundings. The budget he spends on his productions are kept very limited but that really gets compensated by a lot of creativity, inspiration and humor. Brain Damage actually has a lot in common with that other quickie of his, Basket Case. Except that this movie is a lot more light-headed and Frank inserts a lot more comedy aspects here. But not your ordinary kind of comedy. Twisted and perverse humor is a better term to describe it. SPOILERS AHEAD ***** Brain Damage handles about a young man, named Brian, who gets taken over by some sort of reptile creature. It feeds on brains and he uses Brian to find victims. In exchange for that, he provides Brian by visions and good feelings that are caused by a juicy liquid. The creature - Aylmer - takes complete control of Brian and makes him start a killing spree in his neighborhood. **** END SPOILERS. Brain Damage is a lot less atmospheric than Basket Case and that's all due to the portrayal of the creatures in both movies. Basket Case's Belial is a terrifying monster while Aylmer is a funny looking puppet. His eyes make him almost look cute and his voice is too stylish. But, don't let that spoil the fun because Brain Damage really is a must for low budget cult freaks and admirers of exceptional horror movies. Gorehounds will like it for the huge amount of blood that is shed and the bit more critical fan will appreciate it for its originality. Recommended.",
         "Brian (Rick Herbst) a young, handsome 22 year old is \"possessed\" by a talking, independent parasite (named Aylmer--NOT Elmer) which lives in his clothes and injects him with a mind-inducing drugs in exchange for brains! Brian tries to get rid of it, but realizes he's hooked on the drugs. What will he do? Very strange, very gory horror film with obvious drug overtones (although writer/director Frank Henelotter says Aylmer represents a penis). In terms of dialogue and characterization, this is amateur night (you know next to nothing about the characters), but the film does work. Herbst (now Herst) is very good-looking and pretty good as Brian. Also Gordon MacDonald as his brother/roommate is also very handsome and gives a very good, sympathetic performance. Also, each has scenes with their clothes off--not that I'm complaining! However, Jennifer Lowry as Brian's girlfriend is pretty lame. This was heavily cut for an R rating back in 1987--the complete version is available on DVD. It looks great, sounds great and some incredibly sick scenes are in it--all played for laughs. It's a great low-budget horror film. Worth catching.",
         "This is probably one of the best horror movies ive ever seen and on dvd its got a clear, crisp picture. Including theatrical trailer, commentary track, and soundtrack-only audio track. (it also includes a hidden trailer for Basket Case). Everything about it is just wonderful, a must buy! As for the movie its probably henenlotters best, truly tasteless with better effects than basket case and a more interesting story.",
         "I found the DVD of \"Brain Damage\" in a cheap-DVD-chest in a tech store and of course i've immediately bought it, at the time the only title in mind by Frank Henenlotter was \"Basket case\". Well, i must admit that was a great surprise, the story, the cheap props, the psychedelic lights, the '80 visual effects (the first \"lsd-trip\" of Brian with the room filled with water is great), everything works well in a funny and splatter context. There are also some genial scenes like the intro part with the elderly couple, the one with the blonde girl in the Hell club, the scene with Duane Bradley cameo and, of course, the ending scene. In conclusion, a must-see milestone in the '80 splatter/horror comedy genre!",
         "While the special effects look dated in this computer dominant age of cinema that we live in, Frank Henenlotter's imaginative and unsettling Brain Damage has lost of it's fun after all these years, and that element is more important than any amount of special effects. Working from the same fundamental plot basic as the director's hit trash-film \"Basket Case\", Brain Damage portrays a relationship between a young man and a hideous creature unfolding. The stories are very different, but it's obvious that this idea interests the director and links between the two films are more than obvious (the ham-fisted tribute towards the earlier film being far too much so!). The plot sees a young man named Brian waking up in a pool of blood. It isn't long before he's tripping and before he knows it, he's hooked on the brain fluid that a mysterious thing known as 'Aylmer' has pumped into his head. Like all parasites, Aylmer doesn't give Brian the brain fluid because he's a nice guy - he wants something in return, namely the brains of Brian's fellow citizens. Cue lots of bloodletting as Brian and his 'friend' tear their way through the city! The fact that budget was a big constraint to this film is always evident, but it hardly matters because the underrated director has taken his ideas and just made the best of them with what he's got, and the result is far better than any of these big budget but no idea films that people are often impressed by. A bit like that one with the 'great' twist where Bruce Willis plays a psychologist to a boy who can see dead people. My only real complaint with Henenlotter's handling is that he has a tendency to drag things out a little bit. We see Aylmer open up his mouth, stick the thing in Brian's neck and then the fluid going over the brain EVERY time, when once would have sufficed. Many things about the story aren't very well explained, or completely ignored; but there are little hints towards the history of Aylmer, and this gives Brain Damage a good dose of intrigue. Leaving it open is good, but maybe just a little more on how Aylmer came about wouldn't have gone amiss. There's plenty of blood on display, and despite the rather playful effects on the monster itself, Brain Damage still manages to be oddly frightening. And besides, you've got to love John Zacherle's voicing! In case you haven't guessed - this is highly recommended viewing!"
