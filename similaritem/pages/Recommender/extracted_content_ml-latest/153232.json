Deformed bodies, grimacing faces and the materiality of colour make us aware of brutality and sexuality, existential abysses and the fears of existence. Author Melvyn Bragg accompanies the painter throughout his day. This begins in his London atelier, leads us on to his favourite pub and ends up in gambling club in Soho.",

         "Francis Bacon himself was perhaps even more fascinating than his paintings...or at very least he was an amazing presence and a great raconteur. He gets progressively more drunk as the principal interview proceeds; a man who was already brutally honest reaches inspired levels of candor befitting the finest of Irish alcoholics. This is interpolated with many deftly executed segments of a more purely art critical nature. Highly recommended to anyone wanting more of Bacon and his art.",
         "This film makes it all seem to simple: an overview of the artist, and a discussion with him about his work and what inspires him. This is simple, yet i've never seen it done so well. This is the documentary that I wish could have been made about a hundred other artists from Michaelangelo to Van Gogh. Not knowing much about Francis Bacon's personality, I was surprised that he was so candid in the interviews which accounts for the greatest part of this documentary's success. The film itself is photographed and edited with the perfect balance of style that accentuates (not distracts from) its subject and a casual relaxed pacing."
