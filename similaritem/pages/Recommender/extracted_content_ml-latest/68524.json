         "\"Sagebrush Trail\" was the second in Wayne's Lone Star westerns made between 1933-35. It's one of the better entries in the series and is highlighted by the superior stuntwork of Yakima Canutt. He performs many of his signature stunts including a spectacular horse fall into a river, the mounting of a stagecoach from a prone position, a chariot like driving of a team of horses and several flying horse mounts. The story involves Wayne on the run for a murder he didn't commit and searching for the real killer. He is befriended by an outlaw \"Jones\" (Lane Chandler) who brings him into the gang headed by Ed Walsh (Canutt). Wayne and Chandler become friends and compete for the affections of heroine Nancy Schubert. Meanwhile, the sheriff (Bob Burns) and his deputy (Wally Wales - aka Hal Taliaferro) are on their trail. Eventually Wayne discovers the real killer and proves his innocence. This was one of the only pictures in the series that was not directed by Robert N. Bradbury. This one was directed by Armand Schaefer who does a pretty good job. There is plenty of action, imaginative settings and lots of hard ridin'. Not a bad little \"B\" western on a modest budget.",
         "Many of these 30s low budget westerns start with the \"hero wrongly accused of a crime\" premise, finally discovering, catching up with and gunning down the real killer; but this one is clearly not only the best 'Lone Star' western, but is, in fact, an enjoyable, well made film, with themes, photography, locations, and stunt work you won't find in hundreds of other 'oaters.' You'll find at least four different versions out, from the discount b/w (the VINA and who knows how many other $2.00 single film DVD copies; the Platinum \"Great American Western\" Volume 35 version -- which at least has three other westerns on one DVD) to the new colorized versions, including the excellent digitally restored 23-minute Sterling version with a new, modernized soundtrack -- which just zooms by). There's a reason for all this -- it's a landmark film! Basically, the theme is not far from the mythic: the good guy (John Wayne) befriends the man who put him in prison (Lane Chandler with equal screen time), and helps him redeem himself. You get underwater photography of John Wayne escaping the sheriff; the zoom in shot of the Sheriff beside the wanted posters of Conlon and Brant, fading into a shot of them facing each other; the extensive location shots of Bronson Canyon and the Bronson 'Cave,' which has been seen in dozens of serial, western, horror and SF films (including the 1956 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers') that show all three entrances, as well as how to get up to the Canyon; the unbelievable stunt work by Yakima Canutt, including leaping up on a hitching post and over a horse to land on another horse, flying and running horse mounts; and the great acting of John Wayne -- I'm not kidding! Kudos to the director and screen writer! A great introduction to, and high watermark of, 1930s westerns!",
         "I enjoyed seeing a very young John Wayne, before he had developed his signature speech, moves, etc. Sure, it was pure B Western schlock, but I had to check here before knowing for sure he was in this movie, it does not look like him at all. A must-see for all fans of John Wayne and westerns. The one thing I liked most about this movie is that even amongst the so-called \"bad guys\" in black hats, it half-heartedly explored the reasons why some guys joined these gangs-bad raps, wrongful imprisonment, bad choices that left them nowhere else to go and so on, so that even some of the villains elicited sympathy. The only jarring note was the blatant 30s flapper hairstyle and exaggerated eye makeup of the main female character, they didn't even make an attempt to make her look like a storekeepers daughter in the late 1800s.",
         "If my count is correct, this is the eleventh Lone Star Film starring John Wayne that I've seen, and it may be the best of the bunch. Not that it doesn't have it's share of gaffs, but it was entertaining and had some humor to lighten the load. Perhaps it was Armand Schaefer's directing hand that accounts for my preference over the ones done by Robert North Bradbury and Harry Fraser. With no pun intended, this could have been an episode of \"Alias Smith and Jones\". Wayne's character is John Brant, escaped from prison for a murder he didn't commit; while making his getaway from the sheriff, he uses the old breathe through a reed trick to remain underwater. When he surfaces to find an outlaw waiting, he hesitates giving his name, whereby \"Bob Jones\" begins calling him \"John Smith\". Lane Chandler shares virtually equal screen time with Wayne in this oater, as the outlaw who committed the crime for which Wayne's character is being hunted. Yakima Canutt is on hand as the outlaw gang leader, and his stunt work in the film is interesting to watch. The most daring one (as Brant) is when he's covered by a pile of brush and is positioned to grab the underside of a stagecoach to get on board, while the horses have to carefully straddle him in his prone position. For me, that was a sit up and take notice scene, one that cries out for a \"how they made this movie\" follow up. Other scenes weren't half as daring, in fact there were two flying horse mounts that almost missed, but with a low budget production that didn't believe in do-overs, they stayed in the film. However there's a great sequence when (again as Brant) Yak jumps a hitching post and one horse to land on another horse. It's a good thing the horses cooperated. Since I mentioned the use of humor earlier, I'll note a particular scene when Smith and Jones go shopping at the general store, where they both eye up the pretty Sally Blake (Nancy Shubert) for the first time. With a handful of packages each, they manage to break each other's sack of eggs creating a mess. I guess that's why they came up with egg cartons. If you're paying attention, you'll note that when \"Smith\" gets dressed up to pay a visit to Sally, he removes his old shirt to put on a new one. In the story line, he was shot some two weeks earlier in the left shoulder, but that area shows no sign of damage at all. Could Wayne have been that quick a healer? In the same scene, and the only time I've ever seen it done, Wayne's character dabs his fingers into the grease of a frying pan to slick back his hair - where's the Vitalis when you need it! For anyone who's a fan and seen a handful of Wayne's Lone Star films, you'll know how this one ends. Not so much that Smith's name is cleared and the outlaws are brought to justice, but in the fact that John Wayne's character gets the girl. It happens virtually every time, and this one fades on Smith/Brant and Sally in a smooch behind his ten gallon hat.",
         "Great stunt when Wayne, concealed in a camouflaged niche in the road, grabs onto the axle as the buckboard passes over him. Looks like a Canutt engineered trick and looks also like it's Wayne and not a double that executes it. Then too, the wheel spacing has to be perfect otherwise it's road-kill for a young superstar�he really earned his money in those early days. The movie belongs to Lane Chandler almost as much as Wayne. Together, they're a youthfully exciting team, but my guess is that they were too much alike to stay partnered. So eventually, along comes old coot Gabby Hayes and the screen gets one of its really great all- time pairings. Pretty good story from writer Lindsley Parsons, his first screen credit, who later became a prolific producer of B-films. Over time he scripted a number of Wayne oaters with plots generally more involved than most. This one involves Wayne infiltrating gang of robbers to clear himself of a murder charge. There're several nifty episodes-- Wayne hiding out underwater as a menacing boot almost steps on him, the script making him a cook (of all things) for the gang. Note too, the opening scene of Wayne dodging railway dicks after hobo-ing it into town�I expect that resonated with 1933 audiences when half the country was riding the rails. Some good hard riding and a spectacular crash. Too bad, however, that producer Malvern couldn't get the boys up to Lone Pine for that marvelous Sierra scenery. Instead they get to race around the scrublands of greater LA, not nearly as much fun. Note the frequent use of the Bronson Canyon cave for entrance to the gang's hideout. Despite appearances, it's only a few miles from downtown LA and the studios, and was thus a favorite for tight-budget productions, especially sci-fi from the 50's. Also in passing�this is Nancy Shubert's only screen credit, unusual for a leading lady. I wonder what her story was. Anyhow, it's a fun trip down memory lane for us geezers and for those younger folks who appreciate action done by real people instead of blue screens and digital computers.",
         "Some reviewer earlier made disparaging comments about the fighting. Obviously this 1933 movie came along before Yakima Canutt and John Wayne created the style of cinema fighting that is now standard. Yak was the ultimate stunt man. His \"gags\" (as they called them) are still the measure. He is the stunt double in much of \"Sagebrush Trail,\" a fact unfortunately obvious if you watch as I did, on a computer monitor. He is also the head of the gang of bad guys. John Wayne started as a prop man, according to legend, and did some stunt work to please John Ford. \"Duke, show 'em up,\" is the line credited to Ford during a naval film in which cast members feared the choppy seas they were supposed to be immersed in. John Wayne did \"show 'em up\" and jumped in. He gets to swim in this one too, in a scene that was praised by Jon Tuska in his PBS series, \"They Went Thataway.\" \"Sagebrush Trail\" has all the elements expected and more, such as the scene mentioned above. Hank Bell has another uncredited role, and his presence always adds authenticity to any Western. Lane Chandler has a good role, and he co-stars with John Wayne in another stagecoach-related film, \"Winds of the Wasteland.\" I have only two complaints: The sound is not very good; much of the gunfire sounds as if it came from a mine shaft. The final scene was completely inappropriate, considering what came before. Otherwise, this is great. My copy is another in the Great American Western Series by Echo Bridge Entertainment. It comes in a two-disk set.",
         "While it is rather slow at times, and not always plausible, in general this is not bad at all for a B-Western. It's interesting to see John Wayne in one of his earlier roles, and while he's hardly yet become \"The Duke\" in this one, he's likable and worth seeing. The setup is interesting, and while the movie does not get everything it could have out of the possibilities, it still has enough going on to hold your attention. Wayne plays a character who was unjustly convicted of murder, and who has broken out of prison in order to look for the real killer. He runs across a gang of outlaws, and when he begins to realize that things are different than he thought they were, he is faced with some real dilemmas. Later on in his career, Wayne could have done much more with this kind of role, but here he is at least always sympathetic. Although it misses some opportunities to make things more interesting, there should be enough story and action to make this one worthwhile if you enjoy older Westerns.",
         "It was in films like Sagebrush Trail that John Wayne learned his craft, but thank the Deity he got out of doing stuff like Sagebrush Trail. The Duke has busted loose from jail, he was in the calaboose for a murder he didn't commit. He eludes a posse chasing him, but gets into the clutches of an outlaw gang headed by Yakima Canutt. It's as good a place as any to look for the man who can clear him. He doesn't realize though how lucky he got. Now granted this was a Lone Star production, not even a B film. But I would have liked to have seen just how Wayne got into the jackpot that landed him jail for murdering the lover of a married woman if he wasn't involved with her. When we do find who the murderer is that's never explained to us. Since this was for the afternoon kiddie matinée crowd maybe such things weren't delved into even before the Code came in place. Maybe it was a question of sloppy editing also. I think John Wayne's most devoted fans might like this one, I really wouldn't recommend to others, even other western fans.",
         "In the 1930s before he made it big with Stagecoach, John Wayne made a lot of low-budget B westerns. Most are entirely forgettable and some are even terrible. But the one constant in all of them was Duke's wonderful screen presence. This is one of those westerns. The plot's about an escaped convict (Wayne) who heads out west to prove his innocence by finding the man who really committed the crime he was convicted of. There's some surprisingly good stunt work in this, some of it by Duke himself. I also liked some of the twists the plot takes that keeps it from being a standard black hat vs white hat horse opera. Very good of its type.",
         "John Wayne plays a man on the run from the law for committing a murder which of course he didn't do. He meets up with the outlaw gang and him and the guy hit it off and become friends,, after that he is taken to meet the leader of the group played by Yakima Canutt . Eventually the Duke figures out that his \"friend\" might just possibly be the real killer because it is made known in the film that the killer was never caught,. but worse for Wayne is that his \"friend\" kind of figures that wayne isn't a real bad guy , and then the fireworks hit ,as the Duke and the Gang prepare to duel it out,, not a bad \"b\" western from Lone Star Productins,, Wayne and Cannutt do some great stunts in this movie."
