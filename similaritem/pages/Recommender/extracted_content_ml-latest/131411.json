         "John Barrymore is a down and out drunken widower with two children in \"The Great Man Votes,\" a 1939 film also starring Virginia Weidler, Peter Holden, and Katherine Alexander. Barrymore plays Gregory Vance, a brilliant Harvard graduate, a once well-known intellectual, and a raging alcoholic. His two children, however, (Weidler and Holden) adore him, and he is an attentive dad. When his kids beat up the taunting son of the local political boss, Iron Hat McCarthy, Gregory loses his night watchman job. But when McCarthy meets with the party head, he's told the 13th precinct always votes the party in and he has to deliver; on being told the 13th precinct is voting the party, the rest of the precincts will follow. One problem. There's only one registered voter in the precinct - Gregory Vance. As Vance tries to parlay a deal for himself, his in-laws seek to take his children. This is a heart-warming story with a brilliant performance by Barrymore. Pompous but loving, he makes Gregory Vance a likable character the audience roots for through the entire film. He's bombastic and over-dramatic, which is perfect for the character. His stage experience really shines through. The kids, Virginia Weidler and Peter Holden are excellent - and you'd never know Barrymore didn't like to work with kids. As enjoyable as \"The Great Man Votes\" is, it leaves one feeling sad; Barrymore died when he was 50, his best screen years as a character actor were still ahead of him. So we have to take what we can get - and one of his best performances is in \"The Great Man Votes.\"",
         "THE GREAT MAN VOTES (RKO Radio, 1939) stars \"The Great Profile\" John Barrymore, as the \"Great Man\" named Gregory Vance, in possibly his last good screen performance in a leading role. He stars as a drunken (no acting here) philosopher and widowed father of two pre-teen children (Peter Holden and Virginia Weidler) reduced to working as a night watchman. It so happens that he is the last registered voter in a factory district. When the local party machine pins its hopes on the way this district goes, his vote becomes important, and so does Vance. Vance allows himself to be exploited with the aid of a schoolteacher, Agnes Billow (Katherine Alexander), and thus, starts life anew as a commissioner of education. A \"B\" comedy-drama with a lack of big star names (except for Barrymore, whose career by this time was at a decline), the movie plays fast during its 73 minutes running time. During one of its frequent showings on American Movie Classics in 1999, former host John Burke mentioned that Barrymore disliked working with children because they become scene stealers. Indeed the children are here, and are believable in their roles, especially Virginia Weidler, but they don't take away from that Barrymore magic. And director Garson Kanin successfully mixes the plot with sentiment and comedy without making it appear too \"hokey.\" The supporting cast includes William Demarest as Charlie Dale; Donald MacBride as \"Iron Hat\" McCarlty, and Bennie Bartlett as his bully son, Davie McCarlty. And whatever became of that boy actor named Peter Holden, who makes his one and only screen appearance as Barrymore's intellectual son? THE GREAT MAN VOTES, which presently shows on Turner Classic Movies, is the sort of movie that would be best shown on Election Day. (****)",
         "\"Great Man Votes\" is simple, unpretentious, thoroughly charming slice of Americana, made for RKO in 1939, expertly directed by Garson Kanin. Its simplistic view of small-town politics in a by-gone era may be outdated by now, but it passes by pleasantly in its short running time. I wanted to see it because of the legendary John Barrymore, who here gives one of his most honest and satisfying performances as Gregory Vance, an eccentric, once-famous Harvard professor who turned to alcohol after the death of his wife. Vance lives with his two charming kids (Peter Holden and Virginia Wiedler). One day, he has been chosen to cast the deciding vote in the city's mayoral election. Though it is at first a portrait of community in an idealistic American city set sometime in the 1920s, \"Great Man Votes\" is mostly a character study. Barrymore excels in his incarnation of Vance. And he does it well while being drunk most of the time. He is at once funny yet sad, innocent yet scrupulous, sardonic yet charming. This was one of Barrymore's last memorable performances as a leading man and another reminder of what an extraordinary actor he was.",
         "For a movie which is little more than a light diversion, this turns out to be constructed with a surprisingly high level of craftsmanship and sensitivity. I would find it difficult to believe that anyone could dislike this short but delightful comedy. On the surface, the movie is about a group of local politicians whose spin doctors have managed to use the media to manipulate the public to the point that the vote of one \"great\" man will determine the entire outcome of the elections. Ignore the specifics and this political satire is as relevant today as it was when it was made 60 years ago. But the real story is about a father's love for his children and this is what truly makes him \"the great man\". It isn't presented with much depth - what can you expect from a short simple comedy? - but it is done with enough sensitivity to create a real feeling of warmth and affection. All of it's characters could easily have lost their humanity by falling into predictable stereotypes, but the movie manages to completely avoid this. The main character is continually drunk, but he never has to resort to slurring or stumbling to portray this, and his drunkenness is never exploited for a cheap laugh. His two precocious children manage to entertain without ever having to be excessively cute. It's rare to see a low budget comedy which has the confidence to show this kind of restraint. The confidence is well deserved; this is a movie which is sure to put a smile on your face.",
         "This is a fun movie to watch and its not really because of the writing (though good) or the overall plot, but because it's so amazing to watch John Barrymore act when he is in top form. Unfortunately, later in his career he was often so impaired due to his alcoholism that his acting was sloppy and unappealing. However, here he is full of zip and he carries the film from start to finish. It's a small film that manages to rise high above your expectations. Ironically, he plays an old drunk ne'er-do-well who finally rises to the occasion thanks to a VERY hotly contested election. Watching his character transform was a real treat. In fact, I enjoyed it so much I sought out as many of his films as I could.",
         "Increasing alcoholism and aging in general ended a remarkable acting career. John Barrymore was a stage star at the time of the San Francisco Earthquake (which he survived), and it peaked on stage with his HAMLET on Broadway in 1922. By that time he had become the most notable stage star in America to turn towards the movies, with films like DR. JECKYLL AND MR. HYDE and BELOVED ROGUE. He was strong enough to retain leading man status until 1932/33. I would say his last leading men A-features are ARSENE LUPIN, SVENGALI, and GRAND HOTEL. But after that year, while he is still a star and still appearing in grade-A features it is in supporting roles. He does do TWENTIETH CENTURY in the lead, but nothing else followed. Some of these are still first rate films (SPAWN OF THE NORTH, DINNER AT EIGHT, TRUE CONFESSIONS, MAYTIME), but he is becoming more and more of a joke in the industry. 1939 is his last year for appearing in first rate films or to even have a lead. THE GREAT MAN VOTES is his last lead role of value. As Gregory Vance he is a former college professor of national reputation who has drunk away that reputation. But he lives for the sake of his children (Peter Holden and Virginia Weidler). They are all he has left since the death of their mother (the event that sent him into his alcoholic haze). By sheer chance his voting district is the key one in a Mayoralty election. However, William Demerest (gearing up for his politico in the following year's THE GREAT MCGINTY) informs the party regulars that the nation is following this city's election closely (it is an off-year otherwise), and the winning party may well determine the voter's views nationwide the next year. Demerest wants them to make sure their party wins. It seems that Vance's son has recently been bullied by a boy who is the son of the local district leader (Donald McBride). McBride is feared more than loved (at one point his son has to be pulled out of some cement, and a cop who has watched this looks at the impression of the boy's bottom in the wet cement, and says, \"The spitting image of his old man!\"). McBride spends the movie doing cartwheels to keep Barrymore sober and ready to vote for the party's candidate for Mayor. It seems that Vance's vote (which is neutral) will decide the district's direction, and so Vance has to be kept on the bandwagon. With such a weight on his shoulders we have to watch if Barrymore/Vance will vote or not. What is important, his public feelings or public duty? The cast is game and lively, including Barrymore up to the sardonic concluding line of the film. It was a good performance for the great actor to conclude his leading role career. Shortly after he also appeared in an important leading role in Mitchell Leisin's MIDNIGHT (supporting Claudette Colbert and Don Ameche). There too he was in top form. But by then he needed to have cue cards outside the range of the cameras with his dialog on them. He refused to learn the lines by heart (he claimed he would only do that with Shakespeare or great poetry). In fact, he probably could barely remember scripted dialog any longer. After 1939 his great days in movies was actually over. He soon was appearing in films like THE INVISIBLE WOMAN. He would turn to radio, appearing as himself (and as a cartoon version of a drunken ham actor at that) on Rudy Vallee's show. He did go back to Broadway with a play MY DEAR FAMILY, which was a comedy about him as an alcoholic ham actor again. He died in 1942, but artistically he'd been dead for years.",
         "Let me recommend this to you. But first, some history. This was toward the end of the \"the great shakeout\" in movies. The first one was in the first decades of the form and was a battle of the arts to determine just what movies would be. There were a surprising number of evolutionary paths that could have been followed. What won was the notion of a theatrical play, but mimed and made larger. I mark \"Birth of the Nation\" as the turning point there. Later with talkies the whole bag of possibilities was revisited. A huge number -- much larger than before -- of possibilities emerged this second time, but with less variety. Most of them were extensions of existing theatrical and literary traditions. Again, there was a rough and tumble competition that resulted in the genres we have today. This was the end of one of those possibilities, and seeing it makes us a bit sad because it was rich in its own way. And deeply self-referential. Watching the movie in its day was casting a certain type of vote for it, and the story is about a vote. This might be the very last of this type of movie, and the story features a voting precinct in which there is only one voter left. Oh, I guess I should tell you the plot. Barrymore plays a former Harvard professor with two kids. His wife has died and he is now a drunk. He is in danger of losing his kids. For amazingly artificial plot means, the entire country will vote the way a certain region will, and that region in turn will vote the way a certain precinct will. And this, my friends, is the precinct in which our hero is the only registered voter. As he votes, the future of the world may change. There's some bumph about the ward boss and his bratty kid and all. But the whole construction was written just for Barrymore and for him to be a drunk version of a prior giant. That giant in the story is a professor, but he is played as a special kind of character that only exists in a now defunct theatrical world. He's in fact, an actor, a grand speechifier in the Booth Shakespearian tradition of 19th century elocution. It seems a bit comic today, but this was a noble characterization in its time. It was, in fact, the offscreen persona of Barrymore. And offscreen he really was a drunk. And this really was his last major role -- and it was played with him actually fallingdown drunk, doing his bit as automatically as breathing. Everyone else in the drama is designated audience: his kids, their schoolmarm, his in-laws, the gawking townspeople (ready to follow his vote), even the newspapers. It used to be that you could go to a movie and in some of them expect this posturing, this extremely dramatic pedagogical exaggeration, something that goes all the way back to Shakespeare's Holofernes. It used to be enough to just swim in the excess. We still have some echo of that in Pacino and other Italian-influenced frenzies, but the excuse there is intensity rather than the flow of the thing. If you watch this, there's an amazing speech at the end. Our man has cast his vote (which we discover was against the machine -- and we know that after the movie ends he will be killed or the equivalent). He is speaking to the whole world, and gives a speech that has the form of an old-style Shakespearean one. It goes up and down. It has inverted constructions and leaps of metaphor. His has Barrymore being more. And it makes no sense at all. It really doesn't and I'm sure that no viewer at the time knew this (it takes careful parsing to discover), nor cared. It was the show of the thing. Only the show. This could make it onto my \"must watch\" list. There's some good movie-making in the background too. Look at one scene where the kids are going to school and see how nicely we watch their feet performing in a simple echo of their Dad. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",
         "It is no secret that John Barrymore was wildly out of control the last few years of his life due to excessive drinking. In fact, he had become so volatile, that despite his immeasurable acting talent, several studios and producers refused to hire him. Carole Lombard was a tried-and-true friend who had worked alongside Barrymore to great effect in the raucous screwball comedy TWENTIETH CENTURY. A few years later, she had considerably more power at Paramount and had what's called 'casting approval' over her films. For TRUE CONFESSION, she picked favorite leading man Fred MacMurray and for a key comic relief part, she insisted the studio hire John Barrymore. It was a tough sell, but Lombard did get Barrymore for the role, and while he was third-billed, it was a much-needed boost in his then faltering career. Appropriately, he plays a mostly intoxicated scoundrel, but it's a good performance and the film fires on all cylinders. About two years later, director Garson Kanin was working at RKO and was casting a comedy called THE GREAT MAN VOTES. Producer Pandro S. Berman did not think Kanin should hire John Barrymore for the lead. The fear was that if Barrymore became erratic and the production had to be shut down, it would put them behind schedule and cost plenty. But Kanin really felt Barrymore should play the lead in this film, and Berman reluctantly consented. Production seemed to be going fine, and Kanin was getting exactly the right performance from Barrymore and the young actors that had been hired for the supporting roles. Again, Barrymore was playing a broken man (for laughs) and this time he had considerable scenes with child star Virginia Weidler who had actually done smaller parts in two other productions with him. Barrymore and Weidler were striking the right father-daughter notes, until one fateful day when Barrymore blew up and allegedly threw Weidler across the set. Barrymore's reason for body-slamming Weidler was because, in a paranoid rage, he felt that she was upstaging him. He pulled her off his lap in the middle of a take and hurled her at one of the technicians, all because she had been doing some hammy business with a necktie he was wearing while he was delivering a monologue. Obviously, there were stage hands that tended to Weidler at once, while Kanin had to take Barrymore outside to cool down. The film was shut down for the rest of the afternoon, and when production resumed the next day, Barrymore was more relaxed and able to redo the scene. This time, Weidler was instructed not to touch his tie. THE GREAT MAN VOTES was released by RKO in 1939, and it was a hit. Barrymore would continue to do occasional lead roles as a freelancer until 1941. Weidler would go on to give what is probably her most memorable screen performance as the kid sister of Katharine Hepburn in MGM's THE PHILADELPHIA STORY. Barrymore and Weidler never worked together again.",
         "Great Man Votes, The (1939) *** (out of 4) Tender RKO drama about a former Harvard professor (John Barrymore) who has lost everything due to being an alcoholic but when there's a threat of him losing his children (Peter Holden, Virginia Weidler) fate steps in and he gets a shot at proving he's a great man. THE GREAT MAN VOTES is a nice little gem that certainly has its heart in the right place but what really carries the picture is the wonderful performance by Barrymore who really gets to shine in one of his last major roles. It's a well-known part of Hollywood history now that Barrymore was an alcoholic and it's fascinating seeing how Hollywood added this into the majority of roles he did in the later stages of his career. The way it's used in this film is certainly a lot more respectable and better handled than in such stuff like PLAYMATES and THE GREAT PROFILE but it's still interesting because you can't imagine a major star of today's times suffering from alcoholism and it being used in roles. With that said, Barrymore is simply divine here because he bounces off each and every wall within the frame of the picture and in the end you really can't help but love the character. Barrymore was known for going over-the-top at times and he certainly does that here but at the same time when the script calls for something more dramatic he pulls it off like no other could. The final speech he gives really comes out of no where and the drama and passion Barrymore puts into it is certainly something special. The supporting players add fine work and I was really impressed with Holden and Weilder who played the children. I was somewhat shocked to see that Holden didn't appear in any movies before or after this one, which is too bad because he's quite charming here. Katharine Alexander does a nice job as a school teacher and Donald MacBride is very good as the dirty politician. The entire story is a bit too far-fetched at times and especially how quickly Barrymore's character goes from a push-over to a \"great man\" but the film has a good message to deliver and with the actors great performance you can't help but want to bring attention to the film.",
         "I have nothing objective to add to Theowinthrop's commentary on THE GREAT MAN VOTES here at IMDb, but I want to add my own observations concerning and reactions to the film. It had been only a few months since I'd seen John Barrymore, with Delores Costello in WHEN A MAN LOVES (1927), and I liked this role better than that of a man in love fighting the powers that be for the love of a girl and that girl's honor. Simple stuff. In this one, Barrymore plays Gregory Vance, a \"Great Man\" under the thumb of the bottle since the death of the love of his life. He loves his two children, who are part of her, and they believe that he is still a \"Great Man.\" The kids at school label him a drunk, and that's what he is to them. Hearing Vance speak, learning his history, you know he was a Great Man, and you yearn for him to be one again, for his sake and for that of his children. He has that opportunity, and his children are happy for it. (They kids handle the negotiation. It's splendid.) But does he have to sell his soul, in a manner of speaking, to attain it? There's a heavy streak of partisan politics, though the party name is never specified, and you have a ward boss called Iron Hat who doesn't seem so bad as his awful son. This movie worked. Since this was Barrymore's last important leading role, he goes out on a wonderful note. And, yes, he played a good drunk.",
         "A delightful comedy-drama with some most amusing twists, \"The Great Man Votes\" comes across with style and panache. Barrymore is perfectly cast in the title role, though he encounters plenty of competition from Donald MacBride, Luis Alberni, and the kids: Peter Holden and Virginia Weidler. \"Never act with kids\" is sage advice, but Barrymore usually manages nonetheless to hold center stage throughout. In fact, he's never less than fascinating, although Elisabeth Risdon and Brandon Tynan bring off a moving and most charming scene with the children while he's off-stage. Katharine Alexander's role is small, but she makes an excellent foil for the Great Profile. The script rates as quite unusual by the normal Hollywood standard. Occasionally caustic (if maybe a bit simplistic), it introduces the sort of political morality tale that the big studios almost always shunned. Of course, it is set in 1923, but this also allows the movie a nice sense of period conveyed by sets, props and costumes. Kanin's direction seems somewhat clumsy in spots (awkward jump cuts, over-use of close-ups), happily inventive in others (the extended tracking shot of the kids kicking a tin can along the sidewalk). But it all comes to a grand climax with an all-stops-out street parade, followed by Barrymore's final fling of a sting as the curtain falls.",
         "The Great Man Votes is a humble little picture which packs a lot into it; offering a slice of Americana, taking place in \"An American City, 1923\" (well the film tells us it isn't Boston at least). The movie has a similar set up to 1931's The Champ about a man and a single father who has fallen from grace, a loser to the rest of the world but is adored by his children who know him for what he is and help take care of him. Gregory Vance (John Barrymore) sums up this relationship he has with his children with an elegance that John Barrymore does best; \"I believe the devil took you two squirts up on a mountain and offered you the whole world before your eyes, you'd come running back to your old man\". Like Barrymore's Oscar Jaffe from Twentieth Century, Vance is a man who is who is always making references to history and literature in his speech. The character of Gregory Vance is a representation of Barrymore at the time with his declining career brought on (at least in part) from his dependence on alcohol. Vance's alcoholism is prophetic on Barrymore's demise as the man would die just a few years later from the bottle. However one thing was still for sure, he was still a great actor. One interesting side note is that Luis Alberni who played a drug addict alongside Barrymore in The Mad Genius in which Barrymore's character sold him drugs, in The Great Man Votes Alberni plays the reverse as a milkman who deals alcohol to Vance during prohibition. The two children in The Great Man Votes played by Virginia Wielder and Peter Holden manage to hold their own against Barrymore which is no easy task. They are two mature, intelligent kids who even know how the political machine works but when they have to fend for their own and look after their drunk father, they have no choice but to be this way. Virginia Wielder is the movie's real scene stealer. Like in The Philadelphia Story, she robs any scene she inhabits and is even the victim to a punch in the face in one of the film's more shocking moments. Gregory Vance is the only registered voter in his key precinct during the mayor's re-election. It's not explained how this manages to be the case but it's a charming political fantasy in which a corrupt politician is at the mercy of a single John Doe to be elected to office; a case in which one person's vote truly matters. There is no identification of who the parties are in the film but I do appreciate the scene in which a speaker talks about how voters are slaves to tradition, voting for the traditional party choice over and over again; how true. The Great Man Votes also notably showcases America as the melting pot of cultures as seen during the multi ethnic pledge of allegiance given in the children's school. The movie has a number of nice filmmaking touches to it such as the shot of the two kids walking to school in which we only see their feet as the they talk, to an innovative, ahead of its time edit in which the teacher (Katharine Alexander) asks Vance in regard to the well being of his missing children, \"But what about Joan and Donald?\", instantly cutting to Donald in another house saying \"we're doing pretty well\". The villain of The Great Man Votes is the politician Iron Hat McCarthy; not a guy who appears to be in politics to spread any virtue nor does it help he shares the same last name as one of the most vilified figures in 20th century politics. He is introduced giving candy to children because \"they'll all be voting the straight ticket one fine day\", he says in an unsavoury tone; indoctrinate them while they're young. These traits are carried over to his douche bag son which is visualised in an early example of an ass gag in which he falls into wet cement and creates an imprint of his rear end, a constructing worker looks down at it and utters \"spitting image of his old man\" and the camera cuts to the ass imprint in the cement.",
         "A worthwhile film directed by Garson Kanin about a Harvard educated man, played by John Barrymore, who teaches his children (Peter Holden and Virginia Weidler) at home yet still sends them to school. Barrymore's character used to be a \"great man\", a writer in fact, who lost all interest when his inspirational wife died. Now he lives in a somewhat ignorant urban community doing enough work to get by. His kids, taught by him to suffer no fools, innocently cause their father to lose his latest pathetic job by disrespecting the bully son of the local \"demagogue\" Iron Hat McCarthy, a party man played to perfection by Donald MacBride). When the incumbent party discovers that however (Barrymore) votes, so goes the election, they make the Iron Hat responsible for getting (Barrymore) to help get their figurehead Mayor reelected. Iron Hat makes promises (to Barrymore) he can't keep, but (Barrymore) with help from his bright kids, outsmarts them all ... though you can see the last gag coming from a million miles away.",
         "Former Harvard professor John Barrymore (as Gregory Vance) lives in a typical 1923 American city, where he works as a lowly night watchman. Unfortunately, Mr. Barrymore has become an alcoholic. Also a widower, Barrymore may lose his two children due to perpetual drunkenness. Pre-teens Virginia Weidler (as Joan) and Peter Holden (as Donald) adore their dad and try to help regulate his alcohol intake. An upcoming election focuses on Barrymore as he is the only registered voter in his precinct. This may have something to do with the precinct's tradition of always voting unanimously. Having his vote count 100% brings Barrymore much attention. He learns how to lay off the sauce, presumably, and gets close to attractive schoolteacher Katharine Alexander (as Agnes Billow)... Off screen, Barrymore had lost control of his own drinking, but he could still deliver large, succulent slices of acting ham for director Garson Kanin and RKO Radio Pictures. Later roles helped by having Barrymore play an alcoholic. It wasn't all smooth sailing during this film, however. This is the one where Barrymore allegedly threw Miss Weidler across the set. The little scene-stealer was playing with Barrymore's tie while the acclaimed actor was speaking. Notably, Weidler plays practically the entire movie with a black eye. Weidler did not work with Barrymore again, and young Holden never made another film. Making a great impression, the bully who calls Barrymore a \"drunk old bummer\" is future \"Bowery Boys\" series regular Bennie Bartlett (as David \"Davy\" McCarthy). ******The Great Man Votes (1/13/39) Garson Kanin ~ John Barrymore, Virginia Weidler, Peter Holden, Bennie Bartlett",
         "Watching John Barrymore's last films is like watching a train wreck and we do have a fascination with disaster of all kind. Knowing that Barrymore was given to the inebriation he portrays on the screen it's like rubbernecking when you watch his last films like The Great Man Votes. In The Great Man Votes Barrymore is 57 and he must have married real late in life to have fathered children the age of Virginia Weidler and Peter Holden. He's a former scholar who has gone to seed living in a rat trap filled with books and he certainly has given his kids one classical education beyond their years. A great bit of home schooling but his kids aren't exactly ready for the social aspects of the outside world. Especially for a bully like Bennie Bartlett who's dad Donald MacBride is the ward boss of the district where in the particular precinct Barrymore and the kids live, Jack is the only registered voter. Bartlett was the best one in the film. For reasons that were never satisfactorily explained to me Barrymore's vote in carrying the district 1 to 0 for MacBride and his party take on a great significance. So he's courted and feted while at the same time Barrymore has a custody fight going with his late wife's family for the kids. In Margot Peters book about the Barrymore clan she goes into some description of Jack's decline. He had an incident with Virginia Weidler when she was trying to steal a scene. Did not show the aging matinée idol in the greatest light. The Great Man Votes is supposed to be political satire, but it really never accomplishes the goal. It might have been better handled by Preston Sturges and a year later in The Great McGinty he showed how these kinds of films are to be made."
