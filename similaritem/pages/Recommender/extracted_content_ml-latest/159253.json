The story is told and that's that. The rest of the actors also put in OK efforts. Nothing really moved me, though there wasn't anything embarrassing or really badly performed, as quite a few Swedish films these days. The story can possibly be seen as an allegory of Swedish Christianity and some people may like that even if that particular subject is not explored very much. If this or a simple Swedish story of little significance can't be of interest, them this movie is not something one has to see. I wish I hadn't wasted the time."],
