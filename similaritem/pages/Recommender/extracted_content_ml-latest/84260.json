         "When asked about a particular cinematic floater in which he had appeared, Robert Mitchum replied, \"They pay you for the bad ones too!\" I am assuming that Val Kilmer has adopted that as his personal mantra to get him through this latest phase of his career. So far in the past week I have watched Kilmer in The Traveler, Streets of Blood and The Thaw and all of them are terrible.Not his fault, of course, he's just an actor. He is forced to deal with the scripts he is given. The Traveler shows promise at the start, despite the derivative nature of the script and the stereotypes that take the place of characters. Once the supernatural huggery-muggery begins that promise rapidly begins to fade. The story makes no sense. At first it is hinted that Kilmer is the ghost of a wrongly killed man and he is going to enact revenge on the deserving occupants of the police station a la High Plains Drifter. If the script would have stayed with that angle it might have produced an interesting film,if only on the simplistic and preachy level of an old Twilight Zone. But the pernicious influence of M. Night Shyamalan on a whole generation of screenwriters forces the offending scripter to try a big twist at the end and--a common failing with gimmicks of this type--the big reveal is absurd and makes no sense. It also invalidates everything that came before in terms of logic or coherence. Ah well, better luck next time.",
         "Oké, so. Val Kilmer once again playing a role that's far beneath him. With actors not worth mentioning, in a ridiculous story with a ridiculous plot twist. Here we have a drifter, apparently on a vendetta, turning himself into the police who are the obvious victims. Oh BTW I forgot, a little girl dies in the beginning of the movie, which makes you think: 'Maybe that's why he wants revenge'. But no, the girl turns out to be the murdered daughter of a detective in the precinct. So why is he 'killing' these cops? WHO KNOWS. And the end twist which is the single most ridiculous thing about this movie, only get's you so far as to start thinking: 'Wait, so we were rooting for a child murderer and suspected pedophile the whole movie without knowing it?'. Btw, did I mention it? He has supernatural powers. Yep, a child murderer with supernatural powers taking his revenge on the police. Thank you Michael Oblowitz, for ruining at least 40 minutes of my life before I decided to fast forward through all the bulls**t.",
         "On the Christmas Eve in a small town, a stranger (Val Kilmer) enters in the precinct and tells the Desk Sergeant Gulloy (Chris Gauthier) that he had murdered six people. Detective Alexander Black (Dylan Neal) arrests the man in a cell and Deputy Jerry Pine (Paul McGillion), Deputy Jane Hollow (Camille Sullivan), Deputy Toby Sherwood (Nels Lennarson) and Deputy Jack Hawkins (John Cassini) are not able to identify him since the stranger does not have fingerprints. They call him Mr. Nobody and Deputy Hawkins recalls that he resembles the haired drifter that they had arrested and tortured one year ago, when the daughter of Detective Black had vanished. Along the night, while Mr. Nobody confesses each murder and whistles Lacrimosa from Mozart's Requiem, each deputy dies. Sooner Detective Black discovers that Mr. Nobody is a revengeful spirit that has come to kill them for what they did to the drifter one year ago and they are doomed to die. \"The Traveler\" is a weird film with a promising and creeping beginning but also a disappointing conclusion. The mysterious and supernatural story works very well until the moment Mr. Nobody confesses that he was not innocent but guilty indeed. From this moment on, the plot becomes pointless and makes no sense, destroying what could have been a good movie. My vote is four. Title (Brazil): \"O Viajante\" (\"The Traveler\")",
         "Do not believe the 8.2 review this movie is horrible. A cheese burger at McDonalds had a bigger budget. Val tries to look like a Marlon Brando character, says maybe 10 sentences in the who movie. Val looks like he has just come back from rehab pasty faced and drawn out. The movie starts out with him going into a police station claiming he has killed.I'm Nobody is his name he states. This movie from there goes nowhere. The next 1 hour and 33 minutes are the standard formula. Everyone is trying to figure out who he is and they get picked off.The movie is shot is a run down and I mean run down old building (there budget could not even afford to paint the walls). The killing scenes are just cheesy Friday the 13 blood effects. The ending of the film is so formalistic who knows where the director dragged it from. It seems he got to the point well I might as well end this with some kind of happy ending. The acting is Horrible I figured out in the movies first 10 minutes. Run far and fast from this one.",
         "This is a truly bad movie, and not in a good way... Plot is virtually non-existent. Setting makes no sense other than to provide a \"spooky\" backdrop for what is supposed to be a supernatural thriller. (dark-and-rainy-night cliché, cars from the 60's, 70's, 80's, police station house that looks as if it were abandoned in the 60's, phones that died before Hoover...) You'll know (or guess) the entire story within the first several minutes and the rest is just nonsense. This is one movie I truly wish that I'd never watched. A complete waste of time. There are several decent actors, Val Kilmer not getting the chance to be one of them however. The \"twist\" at the end is weak, unearned, and doesn't even start to make up for a really insipid story line. Which, by the way, could be told in less than a minute in 5 or 6 sentences. The additional hour and 29 minutes of fill just aren't that interesting.",
         "Val Kilmer in one of his most convincing roles. He must have been very proud to show his talent in this genius production. When he gave me the look of pure power and evilness, man that was impressive. Then again. Several Times... Getting better and better with every scene. The sounds, the actors.... even old cars. The Twist in this movie is absolutely crazy! It blew my mind! There are some scenes in this movie that will change the way people think of a person being killed with a shovel. Absolutely brilliant when they show the scenes over and over again. If you want to kill yourself... watch this movie",
         "THE TRAVELER - the great horror showing six police officers being punished for their past sin (beating up an \"innocent\" hobo for killing a small girl). Irritating, poor, horrible, terrible, dumb, unprofessional (if you want to add any other negative words feel free to join in). Still going down the drain. Once THE SAINT, now - class C \"movie star\" Val Kilmer shows an exceptional performance telling \"I need money\" in every word. Not even trying, he just whistles throughout the whole movie. Guts flying all over the place, people screaming and... If you want more you need to watch it. Wait. Don't even bother to watch unless you want a good laugh. My words after seeing it: \"Why did you wast all this time? WHY??!!!!!!!",
         "A drifter (Kilmer) walks into a police dept. and confesses to 6 murders...before they have happened. The idea for this movie is very cool and I was actually excited to see a Val Kilmer movie again. Once again though he let me down. This is not anywhere close to the crap he has been coming out with for the last 10 years or so, this one had so much potential but never really got going. When the drifter starts to confess to a murder someone in the police station mysteriously dies in the same manner as the confession (sounds cool right). The problem is that this movie just felt like it was trying to get really good and never got the push it needed. If they would have cut a half hour out of it and did it as a TV show in the vain of CSI or Detroit 187 it would have been great. Too many flashbacks and repeating the same conversations over and over again made the movie feel flat and left me wanting more from it. Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible but it could have been SO much better. I give it a C+. Would I watch again? - Probably Not",
         "This movie was horrible. Besides Val Kilmer, the acting was atrocious! I watched the entire movie despite wanting to turn it off due to its sheer lack of entertainment. It was boring, the dialog was predictable and non realistic, the death scenes were quite graphic (that might be a positive for some people) but still lacked energy. It just seemed like throughout the entire movie I was being fed the plot line directly instead of having to think a little bit. I enjoy having to use my brain and put pieces together rather than have the actors tell me blatantly whats going on. Do not watch this movie. It is a waste of time. Send Val Kilmer 10 bucks instead and then go watch \"The Salton Sea\"...because that was an awesome movie.",
         "I agree with most of the reviews here, the movie (and acting) is awful and it looks like they've stolen Val Kilmer from a Wax Museum. I'm more concerned with Val Kilmers career. Val Kilmer has always been one of my favorite actors and for a while now I've been hoping for a miraculous comeback. I don't have a clue as to why he's been wasting his talents on most of the movies he has starred in for the past few years. A part of me wants to believe his appearance and recent B-movies will make for a stronger comeback when he returns physically fit and giving a strong performance in a good movie. My favorite Val Kilmer performances: Comanche Moon - Deja Vu - Kiss Kiss Bang Bang - Wonderland - The Salton Sea - Heat - Tombstone - Thunderheart - The Doors Hopefully there will be many more to come. How about Val Kilmer and Steven Seagal, both lean and fit starring in a good thriller/action movie? That would be something.."
