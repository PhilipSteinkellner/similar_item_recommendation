         "Anybody should know when you're getting ready to see a Steven Seagal movie you're not getting ready to see a Greek tragedy. What makes \"Exit Wounds\" special is it's all in good fun. There's no pretentions whatsoever. In fact, it even leaves a good share of the running time for comic relief. You have spectacular action in one corner...you have hilarious comedy in the other...what the hell more can you ask for? Seagal hasn't made an action flick in a while, so it was great to see him again on the silver screen. He takes a lot of flack for gaining a little weight. OK, so he's heavier than normal. So maybe him and Sammo Hung been hanging out in the same buffet. But Seagal can still kick butt like he did back in \"Above the Law\" and \"Hard to Kill.\" His action scenes are always fun to watch. As I tell people, I'm not easily aroused by action scenes. I can be just as bored by an action scene as one would get bored during an episode of \"Masterpiece Theater.\" But Seagal's action scenes have a sense of originality and flare. Big deal. He's not the best actor. Does his work require great dramatic acting? Would a dramatic monologue be appropriate during one of HIS movies? Let's be sensible. I think people are way too hard on the man. He's still cool with me. In the comedy department, we have the uninhibited Tom Arnold. Arnold plays the stereotypical cheesy talk show host, who takes anger-management classes with Seagal. There's a hilarious scene where Seagal loses his temper and throws a fit, yelling to the teacher \"I'm a happy person!\" with anger in his eyes. Then Arnold decides that Seagal would be a perfect guest for his show. Also, we have Anthony Anderson of \"Me Myself and Irene\" fame. He was one of the foul-mouthed African-American brothers in the Farrelly Brothers comedy. He gets an even bigger opportunity to flaunt his comic chops in this flick. In fact, him and Tom Arnold have a hysterically funny conversation at the end credits, so PLEASE don't be so quick to walk out the theater. DMX is not a terrific actor, but he's fairly good. He proves his discipline as an actor in a more restrained role than his starring role in Hype Williams' \"Belly.\" In that film, he pretty much portrayed a character out of all his rap videos. So that wasn't a big stretch. \"EW\" gives him more to work with. Not the role of a lifetime, but meatier than a drug-dealing \"gangsta.\" And did I mention Jill Hennesy is in the cast? Oh...mannnnn! She is an absolute knockout! Perfect eye candy! Throw in a gratuitous strip club scene(which this film has), and we have the ultimate guy flick. With DMX in the lead, naturally we have to expect some of his songs on the soundtrack. And he provides some good stuff. One--which was used in the previews and thankfully was used in the movie too--is a remix of \"Ain't No Sunshine When She's Gone.\" It's quite innovative how they insert an artist's songs into a movie's soundtrack. There's also a scene where DMX is picking out a car and blasts on the stereo his song \"Why Do Good Girls Love Bad Guys.\" There isn't much depth to \"Exit Wounds.\" In fact, I don't know if there's any depth. But a film like this is meant strictly for exhibition. And in that department, it really really delivers! It's exciting! It's funny! It's rousing! It's a thrill a minute! You won't be bored for a second! An hour and thirty minutes of sheer, uninhibited fun! \"Exit Wounds\" won't have you heading to the exit. In fact, you probably won't even want to go out for popcorn you'll be having such a great time! Strap in! My score: 7 (out of 10)",
         "I went into this movie with the no expectations, except to see a cheesy action flick. This means I desired high-flying, over-the-top action that includes lots of cool martial arts, mushroom cloud explosions, high speed car chases and catastrophic crashes, and ultra-violent death scenes. Boy does this movie deliver! I've been reading some of the other user reviews here on imdb and many are saying this is Seagal's best flick. I would probably agree that it is close. His stiff under-acting makes him perfect for this Dirty Harry type part. The plot is nothing new. Seagal is a strung-out lone ranger cop who plays by his own rules...well you know the type, this character has been used in countless movies. Basically, Seagal's character finally goes too far (by throwing the Vice President off a bridge no less!) Thus, Seagal gets demoted down to the most dangerous precinct in town. Once there, he begins to discover crooked cops and internal conspiracies. With no one to trust and people trying (emphasis on \"trying\") to kill him left and right, Seagal starts kicking ass and taking names. Yes I know, this storyline is as old as they come, but I maintain that cheesy action flicks aren't about great or novel plot lines. No, cheesy action flicks are about great action with all the things I listed above, in which, this movie delivers the goods with a bang. This movie also stars DMX, who is surprisingly competent as one of the main and most interesting characters of the movie. Generally good performances all around. I never noticed any laughably bad acting. Flashy directing and nice production design are also bonuses. This tired plot even still manages a few interesting twists (I won't reveal anything for those who haven't seen the movie, but lets just say everyone is not how they seem, including the bad guys). FINAL RATING: 7/10 - As good as a cliched action flick can be. Semi-interesting characters, a few plot twists here and there, steady, interesting action, flashy directing, decent performances, plenty of cool explosions, exciting car chases, and numerous excellent violent death scenes. This movie is truly the creme de la creme of cheesy action flicks! Recommended for all action lovers! Noob Aalox",
         "Pretty straightforward action flick that is absolutely ridiculous and yet I can forgive it. You see there was nothing I loved more as a child than watching the movie heros fight the bad guys and ultimately take them out to restore peace to the free world. However, somewhere in the mid-90's, these kind of films (which I have appropriately labelled \"The Big Dumb Action Movies\") became a lost art and gave way to newer more complex action thrillers. In some instances this was for the better and in other instances, let's just say you were left longing for the days of old when Johnny Rambo dashed acrossed a battlefield in the jungle with his extra powerful M-60 machine gun and mowed down some Commie scum. One of the men at the frontline of the old action genre movies was Steven Seagal. His older movies were an action fan's wet dream. They had lots of shooting, lots of brutal fight scenes, and the occasional trademark Seagal staredown. Nevermind the fact that the man couldn't act well even if his children were kidnapped and one of the ransom demands from the kidnappers was for not only $5 million dollars but also for Seagal to play at least one scene in a new movie with a different tone of voice and a different facial expression. But the entertainment was there and when I saw \"Exit Wounds,\" I was automatically thrown back into the mind of a young boy all over again. Here's a movie that gives an old fan of action exactly what they could ever hope for. Lots of martial arts, lots of great shootouts, and over the top stunts (maybe with a little bit of help from those damn cables and CGI but let us ignore this for the time being). This movie is a lot of fun and I was glad to see Seagal make a return to the kind of movie that people actually will pay to see him in, even if this is just a one time deal for the pony tail sporting Aikdo artist. If it is simple minded action you crave, then you can't go wrong with \"Exit Wounds,\" which is really more of a throwback than anything. When you see the legendary action film veteran Bill Duke on the screen with those crazy eyes, you know you're officially watching a \"Big Dumb Action Movie.\"",
         "Despite Fire Down Below being a No. 1 hit in America, it went straight to video here in the UK and killed Seagal's career for four years. But then veteran action producer Joel Silver thrust Steve back in the limelight, put him on the Slimfast diet gave him slightly better material to work with. After all, an actor can only do as good as the script. From a novel of the same name by John Westerman (but bearing minimal resemblance to it) the plot centers on Orin Boyd, a cop busted down to patrolman after a rough encounter with the Vice-President. Once on the streets Boyd's suspicious nose can't keep him out of trouble with undercover cops who are trying to bust local Drug Boss Latrell Walker\u0085or so it seems. There are many attempts at irony throughout the movie and surprisingly enough most of them work. Boyd is forced to attend rage control classes in which he meets eccentric TV host Henry Wayne (Tom Arnold) who becomes his wannabe partner. But sadly enough the classes don't work as Boyd continues to uses violence first, ask questions later. And there is a public service announcement too; Seagal survives a car wreck by airbag. A later car crash victim doesn't have one and dies. Dozens of cop movie clichés staple the flimsy script together. And the bad guys are obvious from the moment they appear on screen. Bartkowiak's direction is better than in his debut Romeo Must Die, and adds a heavy dose of frenetic rush to such a fast-paced film. However the set-up and execution of the story is so dull you'll forget about it half an hour after the credits roll. Seagal has learned a little, just a little, more in the acting area but still doesn't know how to express himself much. There's too much frowning and not enough other emotions from Boyd. We do want to feel more from him but he won't allow us. I guess this is just how Seagal is. He just can't get away from himself no matter what role he plays. I wish Seagal would try harder, but he just never bothers with making an effort.",
         "`There are good cops and bad cops,' says Steven Seagal when asked about why he chose to star in the film. The need for such a question, however, is unnecessary. Seagal will forever be known as one of our generation's top action stars. He's been on trains, submarines, and over speeding cars. His ability to dazzle his audience with every punch, kick, and flip earns him the title of one of our generation's most memorable action stars. Seagal is modest about his action power, however, and prefers to be thought of as a professional martial artist. Whatever the case, his latest effort in Exit Wounds is another film in Seagal's library of adrenaline-rushing, macho-type films. Produced by Hollywood honch Joel Silver, Exit Wounds is a high-kicking, edge of your seat thriller that tells the story of a cop named Orin Boyd, sent to another precinct in the rough streets of Detroit, where nothing seems the same. Corruption, deceit, and betrayal lay only three lockers away. Much like Seagal's enjoyment for his work in the martial arts field, Orin Boyd is a person who is genuinely proud of what he does for a living. All of his anger and frustration is a result of his disappointment with how little his job means. In one of the most powerful scenes of the movie, Boyd is shown hanging up his whistle after his demotion to a traffic director. A cop in Detroit is everything Boyd lives to be, and when his occupation becomes meaningless, so does his life. Boyd isn't alone in his stance, however. When $5 million dollars worth of heroin disappears, there is an underlying truth to everything, but nothing seems to make sense. All fingers seem to point at Latrell Walker (DMX), a supposed drug dealer and one of the best. DMX delivers the most engaging performance in Exit Wounds. Much like Boyd, Walker is a character that is typical in most cop films, but also one that the audience can identify with. As every actor should, DMX gives as much personality to Latrell as needed. DMX, as Latrell, shows genuine emotions for his family, his colleagues, and for what stands to be right. A perplexing character with his actions, Latrell definitely serves to grab the audience's attention. Unlike traditional cop films, DMX and Steven Seagal are able to both grab hold of the spotlight of the film, but with their own unique charismas. Seagal and DMX's chemistry does not involve holding hands and dancing into the sun-setting horizon. It is a tense relationship between Latrell and Boyd, and as the movie progresses, the truths about one another are unraveled, with each character prepared to either fight, or work together, for whatever cause each one has. Joel Silver is known for setting the bar with his films, both in the action and story sense. Some of the most incredible action sequences in Exit Wounds will forever be embedded in the Joel Silver legacy. Along with Silver's knack for blood rushing sequences, he is also known for pulling shocks and surprises in his pictures. Exit Wounds is the type of film where one must really keep his eye open, for he might miss an unexpected, but crucial, turning point in the movie. As Steven Seagal's comeback film, he should be grateful that his first picture in the new millennium will forever remind his audiences and fans that he is, indeed, one of the best on-screen heroes of this past decade. As old clashes with new, his counterpart, DMX, has displayed his fresh talent on-screen and sets a challenge for him to take on new film's, with more demanding roles. In an age where hip hop and kung fu can co-exist in entertainment, Exit Wounds proves that films nowadays still have the potential of attracting just about anybody.",
         "I took in this movie in the theater, in 01' surprised that Seagal was back with Warner Bros. after departing for a while. The first scene was kind of the beginning joke for the rest of the story. I was laughing when he took matters into his own hands and to avoid allowing the 'Vice\" President to be killed in a firefight on the bridge with the impostor police officers that were there for a killing 'contract'. The 'Vice' Prez sort of looked like a cross between Al Gore and then 'future' now former Vice Presidential hopeful John Edwards all rolled into one. I laughed because the best expression that this 'Vice' Prez had on the bridge was...-clueless. And from the exotic cars and the crazy players that brought game to the screen, this was a breath of fresh air, that year. I think that Steven Seagal played himself, as he always does but just like John Wayne and other big icons, that's what people generally go to see, these stars being the stars they are. I strongly felt that the action and confrontation between Seagal and DMX was a favorable match-up. Corruption in the heart of the downtown precinct. A couple of 'hood-ole'' boys to fight against and expose it. It's an age old tale, but they pulled this one off very well. I recommend to action and martial-arts fans. This one is a lot of fun...(***) Thx--IMDb.com",
         "Steven Segal makes a great action comeback in this movie. His last good movie was Under Siege was his last okay movie was The Glimmer Man. This movie is about dirty cops and Segal is trying to bring them down. DMX who is one of the best rapper/actors is also a good co-star. The only let down for me was the fact that Steven and Micheal Jai White didn't have a longer fight scene. All in All this is one of Segal's best.",
         "Segal has been here for years and he has a lot of unfair critics becouse he is an unabashed liberal.He is a Budhist as well which ticks a lot of conservative USA's buttons.But with the growing open mindedness in the US population,Segal does not fade away.This action hero epitomises discipline and heroism.This movie was an average action movie but could have been a classic if the martial arts choreography was done better.There were a lot of cartoonish martial arts sequences that did not belong like DMX holding his own too much against Segal,DMX's shotgun trigger tied to belt sequences,and the like.The movie was very entertaining though and the comic relief was done well.Not the best Segal movie but certainly not the worst.Recomended for Segal fans,hiphop fans,action fans and cop movie fans......",
         "If there`s one thing I love about Steven Seagal it`s the hope he gives to humanity , no matter how untalented you are every man , woman and child on the planet can watch a Seagal movie and say \" Wow , what a guy . A man whose talent has no beginning and he became a movie star . God bless the American dream \" ***** SPOILERS ***** And what a comeback by Steven . EXIT WOUNDS opens with some fascist militia types trying to blow away a politician standing on an anti gun ticket , only to have our hero ride into the firefight and save the day . Ah but don`t be fooled into thinking this is another holistic PC thriller with ecological overtones because the rug is pulled from under our feet with Steven going after a bunch of drug dealing homeboy gangsters . Wow , what a change of pace for a man who makes ecological statement thrillers . Even more of an earthquake is the fact that EXIT WOUNDS contains a lot of humour at the expense of Steven Seagal . Has our hero found sophisticated post modernism ? Will he realise the irony of his initials being SS who `s made umpteen films where he blows away lots of fascists ? I`m telling you after seeing this film Mr Seagal has gone up in my estimation and Vin Diesel wins my vote as the worst action star Hollywood has ever produced"

         "Orin Boyd (Seagal) is a Detroit cop who doesn't follow rules. After he saved the Vice President by violating every order he received he is transferred to one of the worst precincts in the city. There he quickly encounters some corrupt cops selling heroin to drug dealers. The problem is, it's very difficult to tell who is the bad guy and who you can trust.",
         "Orin Boyd is a cop who works in Detroit's 21st precinct, and his attitude and rough means of enforcing the law always end up annoying the precinct captain, Frank Daniels. When terrorists try to kill the Vice President of the United States, Orin kills the terrorists. Even though Orin saved the Vice President's life, Frank doesn't like the way Orin did it, so Frank transfers Orin to the 15th precinct -- Detroit's worst precinct. Orin's new captain, former internal affairs officer Annette Mulcahy, knows of his reputation and tells him that she won't tolerate it, and she sends Orin to an anger management class where he meets Henry Wayne, the high-strung host of a local talk show called \"Detroit AM.\" Despite this measure, Orin doesn't change his ways of doing his job, and it's not long before he comes across local drug dealer Latrell Walker and his fast-talking sidekick T. K. Johnson doing a shady deal with a man named Matt Montini. After a brief fight, Orin discovers that Montini has been working undercover trying to nail Walker, and Orin messed it up, a point that doesn't sit well with Montini's musclebound partner Useldinger. Not all of the cops of the 15th precinct give Orin a hard time. Sergeant Lewis Strutt steps in to cool things down when Orin gets in a fight with Useldinger, and George Clark is assigned to be Orin's partner. After Orin stumbles upon the theft of $5,000,000 worth of heroin from Piper Tech, a place where evidence is stored, Orin and George begin focusing their efforts on Latrell and T.K., and also Shaun Rollins, a man that Latrell has been visiting at the local jail. Orin asks Henry to do some digging on Latrell's background. What Henry discovers is that Latrell is not a drug dealer. Latrell is a computer expert and billionaire whose real name is Leon Rollins -- he's the brother of Shaun Rollins. Orin confronts Leon, who explains that a group of corrupt cops were in danger of losing one of their drug dealers, so the corrupt cops planted heroin on Shaun, setting Shaun up to take the rap so they wouldn't lose their dealer. Sergeant Lewis Strutt is the leader of the group of corrupt cops, who also include Montini and Useldinger, and Strutt and his gang are the ones who stole the heroin from Piper Tech. Leon and his friend Trish have been videotaping the corruption, hoping that it might help prove Shaun's innocence and get him out of jail. Orin meets with Annette at a parking lot and he gets in Annette's truck and tells Annette what's going on. When Montini and Useldinger and a bunch of their men show up and try to kill Orin and Annette, Annette screeches out of the parking lot with Orin still in her truck. Orin and Annette are chased, and Annette is killed in the chase when her truck slams into the back of a bigger truck, sending her into her windshield. Orin tells Frank that Strutt will be having a meeting at a warehouse in about an hour, to sell the heroin that was stolen from Piper Tech. Strutt plans to try to sell it to Leon and T. K., not knowing that Leon is working against him. Frank promises that he'll be there with some backup. Orin then goes to George's house and tells George what's going on. George agrees to help Orin bring Strutt and his gang down. But it may be someone higher up who is behind the whole thing.",
