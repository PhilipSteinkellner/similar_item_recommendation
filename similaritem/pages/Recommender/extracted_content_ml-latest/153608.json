         "Jan (Keve Hjelm) fights impotence (literal and symbolic) and anguished childhood memories in a decadent Swedish castle where risqué parties and daring scenes defy 1960s' movie censorship, reaffirming the ground-breaking role of Swedish films in helping advance adult, sexually concerned themes in international cinema (q.v. Bergman's \"Through a Glass Darkly\", \"The Silence\" and \"Persona\", Vilgot Sjöman's \"My Sister My Love/ Syskonbädd 1782\" and \"I am Curious Yellow\", etc). \"Night Games\" includes a bold flashback scene of Jan as a child (sensitive Jörgen Lindström, who played the young boy in Bergman's \"The Silence\") caught masturbating. Former Swedish star Mai Zetterling's third directorial effort is particularly interesting for atmosphere, decors and cast, but the film is heavily depressing and the rather obvious symbolisms have dated badly. Sphynx-like, marvelous Ingrid Thulin has a field day as the bitchy and sensuous mother; Keve Hjelm is engagingly honest in a role that requires bravado and emotional range. The film is influenced by Bergman's \"angst\" films but also has an expressionist touch to it, because of Rune Ericson's camera-work and experiments with different lenses. If you like films with decadent-bourgeois flavor and angst-filled characters, this is for you. Of course, it's also a must for Ingrid Thulin fans, but it's probably a very difficult film to find these days. My vote: 6 out of 10.",
         "Jan (Keve Hjelm) grooved up in an over class environment and with a strong attachment to his egocentric and cold-hearted mother Irene (Ingrid Thulin). After many years, he returns to his childhood environment, an old mansion that have stood empty for a long time, but the memories live on.",
         "Even in her days working in the Hollywood mainstream as Danny Kaye's leading lady Mai Zetterling always had an air of menace about her; which she more than amply confirmed when she finally got behind the camera herself. 'Night Games' was in its day considered the last word in shocking, but is today largely forgotten; and it's hard to figure out just how seriously we're supposed to be taking it all until the Hal Roach-style slapstick and music behind the end credits finally clinches it: we're not. Zetterling's second feature film as a director evokes Bergman's 'Wild Strawberries' (1957) both through its elegant shifts back and forth between the hero's childhood and adulthood; and by the presence of Ingrid Thulin as the hero's long-dead mother whose hedonistic lifestyle has left him marked for life, and of Naima Wifstrand (who had played Isak Borg's terrifying mother in 'Wild Strawberries') as Jan's dotty old aunt (while Jörgen Lindström, who plays the young Jan, had been Thulin's nephew in Bergman's 'The Silence'). Most of the mother's entourage disport themselves more like characters out of TV commercials than recognisable human beings; recalling the orgiasts of late Fellini and the decadent wierdos who invade Tony's home at the conclusion of Joseph Losey's 'The Servant'. For good measure, the final sordid scramble for expensive goodies resembles the conclusion of 'The Magic Christian'; before Jan finally purges himself once and for all of a lifetime of Oedipal baggage by dynamiting the palatial family home to kingdom come.",
         "There is a reason why this film is unknown and forgotten. \"Nattlek\" is quite bad. It is not as good as Mai Zetterling's \"Älskande Par\" or \"the Girls\" (which I consider as the best Swedish film ever made). I was looking forward to seeing this film. It was released on DVD in Sweden, so I jumped at the chance to watch it. It sounded good, or at least interesting. Ingrid Thulin, who was always a good actress, was typecast here as a neurotic mother to a little boy, (reminds me of the decadence in \"the Damned\" by Visconti). When the boy is an adult he takes with him his girlfriend to the castle where he grew up and they face his childhood demons. The girlfriend played by fresh faced Lena Brundin gives the film some humanity but she has to play opposite Keve Hjelm who is very dull and plays his role in the pretentious acting style people back then thought was serious and worthy. Famous Swedish jazz singer Monica Zetterlund livens things up but has a too brief part in this film. Crazy party guests and relatives try to give the film a feeling of Fellini and Bergman without any feeling or depth. Borrowing fashionable ingredients from other films does not an art-house classic make. The film is interesting to watch as a document of its time. The arty psychodrama films went out of style. This type of film killed itself."
