We follow the two charming ladies in both their difficulties in getting grip of the reasons for the situation, as well as getting on the road of their mission of warning about the urge to make the economy grow on basis of overuse of natural resources. The film starts odd nicely, and takes up speed and starts amazing you with hidden cameras, where they start interrupting, or even worse to important economical meetings. Getting death threats as a result, the brave two grannies are really making a stir. The film is slow at start, but it takes a hold on you when they start to get serious. The film serves both as entertainment, but also as basic learning about economy growth. The story feels sometimes a bit forced, and hard to believe in, but still the grannies are very believable in their oddness and heaps wisdom, age and of hope for the next generation. The film will most likely both give good room for thoughts for the viewers as well as serve as a warning that we don't seem to learn even from history. Filmmaker Håvard Bustnes has here made a good film, and knows when to stop, not dragging the story too much out. Well worth your time!"],
