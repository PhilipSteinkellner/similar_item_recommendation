      "synopsis": "A homeless man (Brian O'Mullin) performs a spontaneous song and dance routine for Chuck Barris, host and star of the television talent contest \"The Gong Show,\" who is stopping at local Winchell's Donuts on his way to work. Barris dismisses the man's showmanship and spills coffee on his own shirt. At the television studio, Barris ignores an elderly violin player (Jack Bernardi), the singing group Satisfaction, a trumpet-playing comedian (Harvey Alpert), and dozens of other acts that accost him. When Barris arrives at his office, Buddy Didlo (James B. Douglas), network vice president of programs, says that the show's ratings have dropped slightly, making Barris ineligible for a raise. However, Barris carries on, auditioning 68 acts, which include strippers, folk singers, comedians, body-part playing musicians, street poets and human spiders. Later in the steam room, Barris' friend, Bernie (Harvey Lembeck), says that Barris looks tired and should pay more attention to his health. The next day, Barris tapes five \"Gong Show\" episodes. One act, Melvin Presar, a chicken-clucking singer, has a heart attack after being called on stage for several encores. At the hospital, Barris tells his girlfriend, Red (Robin Altman), that he feels guilty about making Melvin sick. However, Melvin is so happy to see Barris, he pulls off his oxygen mask and auditions his new act as a budding gingko tree. Barris leaves before Melvin finishes, but Dr. Jerry Queasley (David Sheiner), Melvin's doctor, auditions his \"singing chef\" act, which ends with Barris drenched in a bowlful of batter. As Barris and Red leave the hospital, Melvin performs until he is dragged back to his room. Red warns Barris to quit the show while he still has his sanity. She suggests he hire a substitute host, but Barris tells her the job beats working in a bank. To unwind, Barris plays guitar and sings with a group of friends called The Hollywood Cowboys. One night, the disgruntled sons of a failed contestant with plans for revenge approach Barris as he returns home. He persuades them to create an act instead of killing him. They later appear on the show and are eliminated by the same judge, who gonged their mother. Later, Didlo announces that ratings have improved, but too many television stations are canceling the show because of its offensive content. At a meeting at Matteo's restaurant to discuss the situation, Barris and Red are seated at a special table in the kitchen, as a cook auditions his singing act. When Didlo arrives, he complains that \"The Gong Show\" has turned into \"The Goon Show.\" As Barris leaves for the men's room, Didlo follows, citing Barris' various offenses. Barris promises to behave, but then he pees on a man in the adjacent urinal after he is recognized. The next morning, Red fixes Barris breakfast in bed. However, Didlo barges in and insists that Barris sign a statement, agreeing to produce a tasteful show. Afterward, Barris meets with \"Gong Show\" judge, Jaye P. Morgan, who pledges to put an end to her double entendres. When Barris arrives late to work, multiple acts are waiting to audition and his secretary, Mabel, is worried that he looks tired. Nevertheless, Barris sits through auditions, reminding contestants to stay upbeat even if they are \"gonged.\" Later, Red worries that Barris is on the verge of a nervous breakdown and sends him to a psychiatrist, Dr. Betsy Nolan (Cloyce Morrow), but the doctor determines that Barris is only suffering from exhaustion. He admits he is tired of the show and being known as a buffoon. He wants to do something meaningful. Dr. Betsy urges him to take time off and Red agrees. However, Barris cannot bring himself to stop, and suggests that he and Red end their relationship instead. As she walks out, he stares at photographs on the wall, documenting their love. Barris phones Mabel to announce that he is taking a hiatus and does not know when he will return. The next day, after buying a one-way ticket to Morocco, Barris walks aimlessly through the Moroccan desert until a helicopter appears and lands. A cloaked figure disembarks from the helicopter and approaches. It is Didlo with good news: the affiliate stations want Barris back, and so does Red. The whole entourage of the Gong Show appears to sing Barris \"Don't Get Up\". In the final scene, Barris returns to \"The Gong Show\" and receives a standing ovation. The audience is treated to acts like The Vatican Four, The Siamese Connection, Count Banjola, the Unknown Comic doing his impression of an Eskimo urinating, and the show goes on.",

         "I always wanted to see The Gong Show Movie. As a kid, I was a big fan of Mr. Barris. I wanted to grow up to be just like him. He represented the ultimate in manhood. Made near the end of the Gong Show's run in 1980, Chuck Barris made a critically lambasted vanity project about how much \"fun\" it was being the host of the program. Unlike Mariah Carey's \"Glitter\", Chuck Barris wasn't trying to make a masterpiece. He pretty much portrays a week in the life of himself. You get to see the \"talented\" contestants attempts to impress him to get a chance to appear on T.V. (some of whom were deemed too racy for the 1970's so this R-rated movie showcases performances that never aired). Wherever he goes, he runs into people who were smart enough to know that having zero talent was good enough to appear on The Gong Show; everyone is trying to audition for him on the spot with some zany numbers. Cameos by just about all his favorite judges appear (I liked Rip Taylor's hilarious role as a waiter) and there are some amusing numbers; especially the showstopper \"Don't Get Up For Me\". Although it's not a very good film, it's great to finally be able to see a time capsule of one of the most off-beat programs ever aired on the boob tube. My next wish: I want too see the \"Best Of The Gong Show\" on DVD. Now! BTW, it was great to see \"The Unknown Comic\" again. The idea of putting a paper bag on your head while cracking horrid jokes was pure genius. I think he even had his own movie made in the mid-80's, too.",
         "Chuck Barris has had a most curious, yet successful, career in TV - creating some of the best of what would now be known as the first \"reality\" game show programs. He has even been the subject of a not-quite-weird-enough bio-pic \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\" (George Clooney directing the pitch-perfect Sam Rockwell from an interesting, though downbeat script by the awesome Charlie Kaufman)- but probably nothing rates as odder on the Barris gong than THE GONG SHOW MOVIE. Barris plays himself in this underplayed curio about the strife of being Chuckie-Chuckie-Chuckie. The film seems to veer back and forth from being a behind-the-scenes expose of the nightmare it was for Barris to create, host and syndicate the wonderfully bizarre \"Gong Show\" TV series and a dour, serious filmed autobiography of the troubled, creative genius. Barris, as himself, seems to absolutely hate the Gong Show phenomenon he has created for himself, and overtly resents its mind-numbing success. As a reader coming in from the understanding of his Dangerous Mind \"autobiography\", it helps flesh out his malaise. Directed by Barris and co-written by Robert Downey, Sr., the movie is observant and quite crude, rough and documentary-like, but unfortunately the viewer is left on the outside looking in and cannot celebrate the symphony of bizarreness that Barris created. We end up hardly laughing at the desperation and sadness that Barris conveys of his situation throughout the film. Though the show was a otherworldly treat in the most 70's, low-brow yet knowing way - the film (accurately?) portrays The Gong Show as a meat factory that just exists to churn out awful acts at the behest of it's self-loathing court jester/master of ceremonies and B-list jury of peers - and served up to its junkie audience who can't get enough. This is a most unusual and somewhat fascinating portrait of the 1970's, and is probably easier enjoyed by those who can appreciate the cutting-edge nature of the production, and less by those who are seeking a filmed-version tribute of the cult classic TV show. Ultimately, the balance of self-examination and flat-out appreciation of the cancelled show is off-whack - but should only be seen through the eyes of knowing what you are about to see isn't what you ultimately THINK or hope you are about to see. I would have gladly wished to see Barris mock the acts, guests and surrounding sycophants with a bit more outer vengeance than the implosive, introspective tact he takes on here. But ultimately what's here isn't totally without the familiar faves - there's also The Unknown Comic, Rip Taylor, Jamie Farr and Jaye P. Morgan (and her uncensored breasts). By the way - look for Saturday Night Live's Phil Hartman in a bit part! Pulled from release just days after it's initial opening date by Universal in 1980, and heretofore unavailable on video or DVD (unless you find it on eBay), I would recommend this lost piece of cult nostalgia for those truly interested in seeing an almost-honest, partially laugh-free, docu-drama wrapped around one of the most inherently cultural, whimsical touchstones of the me-generation. By the way Universal - I WOULD BUY THIS DVD. Just in case you're reading this... maybe you and whoever owns the rights to the TV show (Sony?) could get together on this? BACK WITH MORE... STUFF!!!",
         "This movie is just one big \"uncensored\" episode of the infamous tv show \"The Gong Show\" and for fans of the show, like myself, it's truly a memorable classic. When this movie was released 21 years ago, it was bashed by critics who called it \"nothing more than a sleazy freak show\" and that's probably the reason why it was never released on video. I think it's about time that somebody re-issues this hilarious tale of just how far a game show host will go to exploit and humiliate the guests on his show. Chuck \"Chucky Baby\" Barris plays himself in a much more mellow role than the one he played on the show (rumor has it that Barris was high on uppers during almost every broadcast...and it showed) as a man frustrated with the networks who want him to keep his syndicated show on a fine line between the insane and the obscene. This being too hard to do, Barris suffers a nervous breakdown which leads him into exile in a desert in Morocco where all his friends follow him and convince him to just \"do what he wants to do\" despite what the networks who broadcast his show say. This is accompanied by a catchy tune titled \"Don't Get up For Me\". Barris finally goes back to the states and does the show \"his way\", causing one network executive to literally faint during the broadcast. This movie was a perfect ending to The Gong Show itself, which went off the air a few months after the movie premiered. The uncensored collection of auditions and show performances in this movie are priceless. Some of the acts include a man portraying Jesus Christ on the cross singing the Dean Martin tune \"Please Release Me, Let Me Go\", The Unknown Comic's vulgar jokes, two siamese twins singing The Captain and Tennille's \"Love Will Keep Us Together\", Jaye P. Morgan flashing her breasts, a human flatulent machine, an upside down banjo player who is dropped onto the stage head-first, and a folk song about legalizing prostitution, just to name a few. The soundtrack is great and it should be released along with the movie itself. The problem with today's movies are that all of them, whether great or horrible, are released on video while many movies before 1990 were never released on video. It didn't matter if they were great or lousy. I hope to see a copy of this movie on the market within the next few years. My copy isn't that good because it's very very old and barely watchable. That's why we need this cult classic on video. See it if you can. If not, petition to see it by having MCA Universal release it on VHS and DVD. 21 years without it is enough. Get your act together Universal...it's about time.",
         "Actually, it's a MUST see for Gong Show fans. The film is uneven, but there are some excellent scenes such as the hospital scene. Plus, you get to see Gong Show rarities like the popsicle twins and Jaye P.'s unsheathing. Note that 30% of the voters (so far) have given this film a 10 and about 30% have given it a 1 !",
         "Hollywood gave us \"Birth Of A Nation. It gave us \"Gone With The Wind\" and \"The Wizard of Oz\" in one year, 1939. \"Citizen Kane\" followed and was itself followed by such classics as \"The Best Years Of Our Lives,\" \"On The Waterfront,\" \"The Ten Commandments\" \"Ben Hur,\" and \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" among other titanic films. Then in 1980, the one true master, the genius that is Chuck Barris, gave us \"The Gong Show Movie,\" based on what was perhaps Newton Minnow's brightest light, the TV show, \"The Gong Show.\" In a nutshell, this is what it's really all about. Life itself. The secrets of the universe revealed and the meaning of life itself, all for you and me in glorious color. All in \"The Gong Show Movie.\" BTW, the 10 score and this review might be just a tad facetious. Maybe. Possibly.",
         "A much underrated (and sadly, widely unavailable) film about an egomaniacal talent show host starring the co-writer and director of the film who also just happened to be the host of the real Gong Show. Although at times self-indulgent (the film ends with most of the Gong Show regulars trying to woo Barris out of the desert), the film is on the whole truly bizarre and should appeal to fans of \"out\" cinema of the 60's and early 70's. No surprise, then, that the film was co-written by underground legend Robert Downey Sr. whose presence is strongly felt; fans of his work should not be taken aback by Barris's role in the spotlight as Downey clearly had some significant input here. Don't miss it if opportunity arises, and what with Spike Jonze working on a Barris related project, hopefully opportunity will be more available soon.",
         "If you weren't a fan of Chuck Barris' silly game show, you probably should steer clear of this movie. But if you WERE a fan (or are just curious to check out a particularly wacked-out part of television history), you'll probably derive some totally mindless enjoyment here. The story, such as it is, revolves around a typical week in the life of Barris and the trials and tribulations he goes through to make sure the show goes on - dealing with guests, panelists, fans AND battling the network brass who want him to tone down the raunchiness BUT keep ratings up at the same time. This movie is definitely Chuck's baby he co-wrote, directed, stars and even wrote a few toe-tapping ditties on the soundtrack. Some saw the movie as a shameless vanity project, but I think they missed the point Chuck Barris WAS \"The Gong Show\" and his trademark wackiness was a huge influence on TV game shows of the period (\"The Dating Game,\" \"The Newlywed Game\" and \"The $1.98 Beauty Contest\" are others he created or helped create). As the story unspools, there are lots of very funny out-takes deemed \"too hot for TV\" laced into the proceedings and lots of familiar faces from the show's heyday can be spotted, adding to the fun. This movie is an amusing tribute to an odd but essential piece of TV history.",
         "I used to hurry home from school every afternoon in time for The Gong Show, which even my mother would watch instead of whatever soap opera was airing on the other channel. This erratic big screen version of the show captures its anarchic appeal, and whilst the 'story' is less than interesting, the uncensored material from the show itself is priceless. There's also one truly brilliant moment in the framing sequences: toward the end of the film, the cast pursue a harried Chuck to the Sahara Desert and serenade him with a marvelous song called Don't Get Up For Me--one of several songs penned by Barris for the film. It's well past time for the original series to be resurrected on DVD, and it's something of a surprise that this spin-off has been unavailable on home video all these years. A nostalgic treat for those in the 35-55 demographic, The Gong Show Movie may not be high art, but it will certainly leave you laughing.",
         "Basically this is just a fictional tale of Chuck Barris going crazy trying to keep the \"Gong Show\" on the air and appease the censors at the same time. Those sections of the movie are drivel--unfunny, really stupid and tedious. But when they show unedited acts from the \"Gong Show\" this movie takes off. The acts are sick and crude--and absolutely hilarious. My favorites are a version of the \"Vatican Rag\" (with one guy dressed as a priest and three other guys as nuns acting out the song) and some teenage girls sucking on popsicles that are--um--a very unusual shape and color. All the acts are good, but these two stand out. I'm shocked that this isn't available in video or DVD! It bombed at the box office but so did \"Ishtar\" and I see tons of those available! Hopefully with the Chuck Barris movie being released soon this will be rectified. Not a good movie but a very fun good-bad movie. And you get to see Jaye P. Morgan's breasts!",
         "The Gong Show Movie, is about The Gong Show's creator Chuck Barris (who also co-wrote and directed this film) who after several auditions for the show and taping it is getting exhausted. For those who have never seen The Gong Show, it was a game show hosted by Chuck Barris, where they would get people to perform on stage showcasing a talent of theirs and they are judged my several celebrity judges and if they are not liked then a huge gong would be banged. Several of the people on the show had some very unusual and unique talents which would make the television show funny. In the movie Chuck, is getting fed up with the show and trying to keep the ratings for the show up as well as making sure the show isn't offensive and doesn't offend the audience. Everywhere he goes people seem to recognize Chuck and show him their own talents which they hope can be showcased on the television show and eventually Chuck as a breakdown and it is up to the staff and crew of The Gong Show to bring him back. I have never actually seen an episode of The Gong Show, but I have read about it and seen clips of it and it looks like it was a fun show. The show was a hit for several years but when this movie came out to theaters it did very poorly and it currently isn't available on video or DVD. The film isn't very well made and at times it looks like a made for TV movie. The acting also isn't that great and the film tries to make us laugh with several different jokes and sketches but the jokes and sketches just did not work and they did not work and they did not make me laugh. There also really isn't much of a story to this film either other than showing different people auditioning for the show and Chuck's run ins with bizarre fans of the show and spending time with his girlfriend Red. Despite these flaws there was still something I liked about this movie. It was entertaining enough and in some ways the film was so flawed that it almost gave it a campy charm making it fun to watch. The film is entertaining and there are some catchy musical numbers so I'm recommending it for those who will appreciate this film more for it's camp value then anything else because the sheer fact that this film doesn't work on a lot of levels coincidentally does make it work as a B film.",
         "Having searched for this movie high and low, I actually found it when I least expected, playing on the Sundance Channel very early in the morning one day. Why I searched endlessly for a small vanity project that Chuck Barris that was made during the last waning years of the TV show, I haven't a clue. The film is simply put horrible. The scripted part that deals with a week that is. Of course the highlight of the film is seeing the real performers that were \"too hot for TV\" or rejected for some reason or other. That part is still horrid, but campy bad which was enjoyable in it's own way. Now that I saw what I sought after for so long will I watch it again in my lifetime? Resoundingly NO!! Do yourself a favor and just watch the MUCH MUCH better \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\" or find old copies of the actual show. The girl act where there just lick popsicles provocatively was fun, but having to endure seeing Jay P. Morgon flash the audience has in all likelihood made me sterile. In hindsight, I'm so very happy that this was massive flop, for if it was a massive hit, there could have been a \"The $1.98 Beauty Show Movie\" and THAT my friends would surely have brought upon the Apocalypse. My Grade: D",
         "If you haven't seen the gong show TV series then you won't like this movie much at all, not that knowing the series makes this a great movie. I give it a 5 out of 10 because a few things make it kind of amusing that help make up for its obvious problems. 1) It's a funny snapshot of the era it was made in, the late 1970's and early 1980's. 2) You get a lot of funny cameos of people you've seen on the show. 3) It's interesting to see Chuck (the host) when he isn't doing his on air TV personality. 4) You get to see a lot of bizarre people doing all sorts of weirdness just like you see on the TV show. I won't list all the bad things because there's a lot of them, but here's a few of the most prominent. 1) The Gong Show Movie has a lot of the actual TV show clips which gets tired at movie length. 2) The movie's story line outside of the clip segments is very weak and basically is made up of just one plot point. 3) Chuck is actually halfway decent as an actor, but most of the rest of the actors are doing typical way over the top 1970's flatness. It's a good movie to watch when you don't have an hour and a half you want to watch all at once. Watch 20 minutes at a time and it's not so bad. But even then it's not so good either. ;)",
         "No wonder this movie never saw the light of day. The timing was of the release was awful. The Gong Show had already \"jumped the shark\" by the time the movie came out, so who would pay money just to see a few of the censored clips from the original run of the show? And the show clips are just a tiny bit of this pathetic, 90-minute whine by Chuck Barris about how hard his life was as host of the show. Did he really expect we would feel sorry for him and his messed-up millionaire life? Did he really think we even wanted to KNOW about his life? (Obviously so, since he later wrote his weird autobiography about his career as a CIA operative.) Did he think the gag of having everyone, everywhere audition for him would stay fresh for 90 minutes? Or the network executive hounding him at every turn? This might have worked as the plot for a 30-minute sitcom episode, but not as a full-length movie. However, it was nice to see Rip Taylor, Gene Gene, and the Unknown Comic again (although, to make the movie \"spicy,\" they included only his most vulgar routines). And as someone else has pointed out, this is Phil Hartman's first significant movie part (even though it lasts only a minute). Note his name is spelled HARTMANN in the credits, which is the name he was born with. You can't miss his voice and facial expressions, even though he's much thinner and younger than in the SNL days. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a tiny part; one of his first after leaving the soap world.",
         "I saw this terrible film when it was released in 1980. I couldn't believe how bad it was -- and I went in with low expectations. I saw the last half again on cable last night, and the film was just as bad as I remember. Chuck Barris's acting style, as such, is to look at the ground and mutter to himself and shake his head -- every five seconds. Chuck Barris the director has given himself a juicy role and lots (lots and lots) of close ups. The actress playing Barris' long-suffering girlfriend is photographed like she is playing Beetle Bailey -- you never see her eyes, for the hair hanging over her forehead, or the floppy hats that hide her eyes. The narrative strategy of this film is to repeat the following situation -- strangers accost Barris and do impromptu and unwanted auditions for The Gong Show. Barris invariably looks at the ground, shakes his head and mutters to himself. During the prolonged finale, which attempts to be a Fellini-esque parade of grotesques, Barris looks at the ground, shakes his head and mutters to himself -- a lot. I can understand the feeling.",
         "I was born in 1975 so I was too young to have ever seen \"The Gong Show\" on TV, though I found several clips on YouTube. For those who are not familiar with it, try to imagine \"America's Got Talent\" minus anyone who is in any way marketable. Chuck Barris created the TV show and wrote and directed this movie that mixes footage that was censored from the original TV show with a storyline about Barris trying to escape the show while battling both the network censors and the talentless losers who want to be on it. Barris staggers through the film in a way that suggests what Tim Burton's \"Ed Wood\" might have been like if it had focused on Wood's post-Lugosi decline into alcohol and soft-core porn movies and novels. I should point out that I didn't laugh so much as just stare in stunned amazement at the acts. Some of this stuff is infamous and you've probably at least heard of them if not seen edited versions. The acts are presented in a rapid-fire montage style that predates MTV by a year. It's not for everyone, but if you've got an open mind, it is worth seeing.",
         "Fans of Downey Sr. (which should be an enlarging group now that the box set of his early titles has appeared) should not miss this movie. It's Downey's humor all over the place, and it's a riot. The non-Downey parts -- the stuff about 'the miserable life of Chuck Barris' -- is just as appealing, in its way; it's great cult trashola. Moreover, Barris, who'd never convince anyone that he was a genuine actor, has great charm, and projects a sense of distance and disbelief that works very well as we watch him bouncing off the madness. Granted, it helps if you remember the awful TV series, but I don't think it's an absolute necessity. You're probably better off watching \"Chafed Elbows\" or \"Putney Swope\" first... if those tickle you, you're ready for this. Perhaps the movie's strangest quality is how undated it is: watch one episode of \"America's Got Talent\" and you're right back in the Gong Show era. It's an odd statement about our country -- or maybe contemporary civilization -- that can we watch this stuff without retching, but in any case, we can, and could, at least as far back as the '70's. I must say I do find it hard to believe that Downey did not actually direct at least parts of this; Barris is the only director credited, but the atmosphere of much of it is Downey through-and-through. Yippee!",
         "How often do we see a movie version of a game show, huh????? Not much!!!!! Now, this review's on the TV show AND the film!!!!! A real 2 in 1!!!!! The show: \"The Gong Show\" is no ordinary game show. There's no puzzles or wheel spinning if I can remember; it's more of a talent show. The \"50 Greatest Game Shows\" on GSN aired an episode of this recently; unfortunately, I missed the episode, but I found out that it not only had Steve Martin in it; it also had probably one of the loudest crowd gestures the series has ever had!!!!! However, I do recall that \"Tool Time\" made fun of this when they were searching for words to add to the wordless theme song. The movie: I haven't seen it, but can you believe it????? How's about \"Wheel of Fortune: The Movie\" or \"The Price Is Right: The Movie?????\" Now THAT will get everybody going to see those movies!!!!! Overall, I give \"The Gong Show\" a 10 out of 10; no, make that a 20 out of 15 as this will make the show skyrocket!!!!! LOL"

         "The Gong Show Movie is a 1980 film that shows a fictional week in the life of Chuck Barris as the host and creator of The Gong Show, through a series of outrageous competitors, stressful situations, a nervous breakdown (which compels him to run away and hide in the desert) and other comic hijinks in his life and work on the TV show. Among the highlights included a group of men dressed as a Roman Catholic priest and three nuns lip-synching Tom Lehrer's song \"The Vatican Rag\", the uncensored version of Jaye P. Morgan's infamous breast-baring incident and a man blowing out a candle with flatulence."
