            "content": "For Mithran (Jayam Ravi), the protagonist of Thani Oruvan, a person's friend shows his character while his adversary shows his capacity. Mithran is a young IPS officer whose only goal in life is to find a worthy rival \u2014 a kingpin who is the root cause of all other crimes \u2014 and destroy him. He meets his match in Siddharth Abhimanyu (Arvind Swami, making a glorious return), an ambitious scientist-businessman, for whom money is all that matters. This is how Mohan Raja sets up the conflict in Thani Oruvan, an efficient thriller, which packs a mighty punch. Raja's films so far have been competent remake efforts, but nothing prepares us for the smart writing (the director has co-written the film with writer duo Suba, whose experience in pulp novels comes in handy as it did earlier this year in Anegan) and the sleek filmmaking we see here.\r\n\r\nThe plot kicks in once Mithran learns of Siddharth's plan of sabotaging a deal that would result in cheaper medicines for the poor and tries to thwart it without his knowing, but the wily Siddharth manages to succeed. Realizing that he has an opponent who will not stop until he is defeated, Siddharth begins a cat-and-mouse game with the cop. There are some terrific moments \u2014 the scene where an assassination plan swings both ways, the scene where Mithran discovers Siddharth has paid his place a visit, the scene where two lives depend on Mithran finding a bug, the scene where Siddharth negotiates with the chief minister. What is refreshing is that, to a large extent, Raja manages to avoid diversions in the form of romance and comedy. Mithran's batchmate Mahima (an ideal Nayanthara) is in love with him, but she isn't just a love interest. She is intelligent (a forensic expert) and fearless and an essential person in Mithran's battle against Siddharth. In fact, when he says that he is ready to give up his life in order to bring down Siddharth, it is Mahima who makes him see his flawed approach to stopping crime. Yes, we get some fun moments with Thambi Ramaiah, who plays Siddharth's father, but it is never at the cost of the narrative.\r\n\r\nThani Oruvan is a bit too long (Siddharth enters the picture quite late), there are leaps of logic (like the one involving a dubbed video evidence) that we are asked to turn a blind eye to, but such downsides are minimal. And even though it is a plot-driven film, the film gives us well-rounded characters, who lend the slightly far-fetched story plausibility. The film doesn't shy away from showing Mithran for who he actually is \u2014 an angry young man whose ideals have turned him into an almost psychotic person. Crime, for him, is an obsession. What keeps him grounded are his fellow cop friends and Mahima. Jayam Ravi's body language \u2014 the purposeful strides, the clenched fists, the stern face \u2014 displays the determination of the character but doesn't really capture the craziness of the character.\r\n\r\nBut Arvind Swami aces the role of Siddharth. He projects the insouciant arrogance that tells us not to be taken in by his classy style which hides the character's toughened hide, and it is no surprise that we even root for this character, the villain, when he makes his moves against the hero. 'Show me your enemy and I'll tell you who you are', the film tells us in the beginning. With Siddharth, the film shows that you could paraphrase that statement and get the recipe for a thriller \u2014 'Show me your antagonist and I'll tell you how effective your film is'.",

            "content": "> A cop vs an evil scientist! The ultimate clash!\r\n\r\nThis is definitely your regular Indian style film, but the script was top notch, that's the vast difference you would find in this. It was a cop-thief clash theme something like the Korean film 'Veteran'. Initially I thought it might be a remake of some Korean film, because it looks like a Korean thriller, but after learning that it was an original, I was amazed. Because, you know, the director has a nick name called remake Raja. He's known for bringing the Telugu blockbuster to the Kollywood. That's not bad and I'm not against remakes, he sure did do a wonderful job with those projects to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe actors were brilliant, especially like everybody saying Aravaind Swamy in a negative role stole the show. The plus point was minimizing the musical track. I mean the narration was not interrupted by unexpected and unnecessary musics and dances like usual Indian films does, except on one occasion I think. The two and half an hour was too long, but that's the average Indian film length and totally worth it.\r\n\r\nNot easy to predict, but in a few segments you would know what might come in the next scene. Because it might be an awesome film for the Indian audience who are seeing it for the first time, but in the world stage it is just an above average with partial cliché. There were a couple twists, the ending was excellent too, and looks like a follow up might come. My only disappointment was they missed a wonderful opportunity to make this film more realistic in the line of 'Unnaipol Oruvan'. Instead, they opted to narrate it more commercially appealing way.\r\n\r\nSo if you are an Indian or watch regularly Indian films, you would find it great. I was impressed with the film's promotions and it did well at the box office. Now it is getting remade in a couple of other languages, I hope they would as well do well. The brothers; the lead actor and the director did many projects together, but this one was a very special and will be a game changer for their respective career. So you might need to check it out if you haven't seen it yet. I'm not saying it is a masterpiece, but if you know Indian cinemas, then would learn how unusual it is.\r\n\r\n7/10",

         "I was Dumbstruck when I saw this movie at theater. M.Raja has indeed grown a long way from being a 'remake' director to his 'own make' director. The base script is usual one - good vs bad. But the way it has been scripted especially the bad part, deserves standing ovation! PROS: Aravind Samy - dashing stylish villain is everyones favorite and he doesn't disappoint you ! This villain is very unique! He didn't lay his hand on the protagonist at all! not even for a single shot. He carried the bad role in a subtle but powerful manner! You will surely fall in love with this character! Thambi Ramayyah - humour is different from comedy and he is the trump card in this movie who keeps on giving us some enjoyable part with his innocence. Jayam Ravi - He worked very hard for this movie! It is evident from the word go itself. This is a tailor made role for him and he did exceed the expectations. Atlast, Raja - scripting a detailed cop thriller with pacey screenplay is very difficult and he succeeds very much here! Very good movie after Thuppaki which should be watched in theaters purely for its excellence in story telling! This is a smartly made movie though not a genius film! Kudos to the whole team! Very happy to watch a very good thriller.",
         "This would be my first ever reviews/ comments in IMDb, though am a regular user I found this time for this movie I should give some reviews here. Totally fantastic picturization and a very strong script. Enjoyed the flow how the director taken us from the beginning till the end. A huge break for all the cast and crew of this movie. Mohan Raja proved the best of his talent and Music/ BGM by Hiphop Tamilzha Aadhi is awesome too. Best movie scene... - When child Sidharth Abhimanyu speaking of the deal for his father to take the blame from Naser. - When Sidharth Abhimanyu got shot by his lover and lying on lap of Jayam Ravi with the last dialog was simply superb. Worth of every penny!",
         "The movie title itself gave me goose bumps. A thriller is expected after all the promotions. But a thriller with a true meaning and less illogicalstuffs is Thani oruvan. The twist in the beginning scene itself will make you understand what you will watch for the next 2 hours. More than Ravi his brother deserves the applause for scripting something original and keeping the audience thrilled till the end. That's something very rare. But he managed to do that in this flick. But the next main person who should be saluted,awarded,appreciated,loved,and of course all the other synonyms is Aravind Swamy. Can a villain be so loved by everyone?. I think that has happened now. Performance to a next level. Ravi has done a commendable job in first choosing such a script which has more importance to the villain than the hero. And of course at the end everyone will appreciate the only performance which stands out that is Sidharth Abimanyu. An enjoyable ride. I am sure all will love it...",
         "Few years back, Tamil movies were junk. But now, the time has gone and they had grown up. At once I can say this movie is a Excellent & worth watching. Jeyam Ravi is doing the finest job over here as the hero while Arvind Swamy doing a magnificent role over the villain. Nayanthara is bit small character in here as Mithran's girlfriend & the director should focus to take much more from her. And a word about the director, M. Raja has proved that he can do many things more than re-making old movies. And the musics were very good & synchronized with the movement of the movie. and the finally, I would say that this movie is worth watching. You have to spent 2hours and 37 minutes. but it deserve it.",
         "A well enacted thriller with a racy screen play portrays the war between the good and the bad (evil). Jayam Ravi's brother Director M.Raja has given so many hits but most of them would be remakes of success films in Telugu. This time he has took quite time to pen his story and screenplay after his last venture Velayudham starting Vijay which has worked quite well even though the basic concept is the same cat and mouse game. Corruption, Corporate mafia, underworld, Pharmaceutical Company's illegal research, Goons, Strict and straight forward IAS, IPS officers working with anti corruption motto, realistic fight with corporate Dons, A Solo Hero with a vision and a supportive lead lady some of the keywords that can describe this movie's plot. The ultimate show stopper of the movie was the performance of the antagonist played by none other than the yester year's charming hero Aravind Samy. He plays Siddharth Abimanyu a suave middle aged notorious scientist and has lifted the role to a different level with his charisma in a sophisticated set up. His comeback as a good hearted priest didn't work out in Kadal but sure this negative role will be a break through character in his career. Mithran (essayed by Jayam ravi ) is the best cop ever who shadows his aim case and moves exactly with his supporting team of friends. Mahima (played by the beautiful dusky Nayantara) who is head over heels with Mithran supports him with her skills. The overall love sequences seemed sensible and mature didn't bore us with instant dream sequences except the one and only song which was bearable. Other than these leads we have Nasser, Thambi Rammaiah (don't know how many movies he will play the same innocent character with the same tone), Vamsi Krishna, Ganesh Venkat Ram, Jay Prakash, Mugdha Godse (of the Hindi movie Fashion fame). On the technical bit like cinematography, editing, BGM, Arts was in place and gave what was needed for a script like this. Except a bit on editing would have made it look perfect. At times it would make you feel and compare portions with Kakha kakha and similar cop movie series, plus Ramana, Nimirndhu nil, E, Thupakki etc Verdict: A good thriller with an over shadowed antagonist which is the current trend where villain takes over easily.",
         "As we all witnessed during the past 10 days or so, 'Thani Oruvan' got rave reviews and has been accepted by the film industry and audience as a benchmark movie. There is a transition happening in the Indian movie industry; that is driven by the audience. Today movie goers are well aware of the worldly events. The life-cycle of audience taste is short, meaning audience preference is undergoing change at a higher rate than ever before. The typical romance movie is no longer going to pull the audience. It had been already exploited by the uncountable number of movies in all the possible formats. So what is next? That is called 'Thani Oruvan' way! - A strong theme, embedded with authentic data & logic. How it all started? Way back in 2013, director Mr. Mohan Raja met with a group of consultants from Fhyzics Business Consultants Pvt. Ltd., specializes in business consulting and business analysis (An EEP of International Institute of Business Analysis, Canada and REP of International Requirements Engineering Board, Germany). By that time, Mr. Raja was thinking about the story for at least 3 years. The one question he asked the group of consultants was \"I want to make the movie authentic and different, how you could contribute?\" Fhyzics was also looking for opportunities to explore the movie industry. Subsequently, Fhyzics team met the director few times and demonstrated how they can make it different. It clicked, and Fhyzics got its maiden movie project. The assignment given to Fhyzics team is data and logic research for the movie project. The team researched the IPS training, minute-by- minute daily routines of IPS probationers and officers, costumes, usage of words & terminologies, technologies, background, analysis methods etc. The team also did intensive research on crimes both at national and international level from 1990 onwards to till-date. Organized the crimes under different heads and drawn the linkages. Prepared crime charts, time-to-time emotional graphs, hero vs. villain rise & fall maps etc. Even Fhyzics created a PPT that was presented to the producers by Mr. Raja to give them a holistic view of the movie. Massive amount of data and information were collected, organized in SharePoint (a Microsoft technology), then distilled and presented on weekly basis to the director for the entire duration of the movie making and it has been judiciously consumed in the movie without affecting the entertainment element of it. At Fhyzics, we profoundly thank Mr. Raja for the opportunity and helping us in launching our services in the movie industry with this landmark movie, 'Thani Oruvan'.

         "Go and watch this in theater. Mohan Raja made Tamil movies one step higher. All the characters have done their best. Jayam Ravi catches all the people's attention in each and every second of the movie. Nayanthara's best movie I can say. She did a wonderful acting. Each and every second of the movie went thrilling and I sat on the edge of the seat while watching. Villain was amazing. BOSS OF THE OTHER VILLAINS IN TAMIL CINEMA. Only few comedies but nice one. Don't miss it.You can watch this movie more than 10 times. It is also the best police based movie. There are so many amazing twists in the movie. Best movie of the decade.",
         "Cent percent worth the expectations,Mohan Raja's Thani Oruvan puts an end to the long wait for a neat thriller from Kollywood and delivers two memorable characters Mithran I.PS and Siddharth Abhimanyu,portrayed by Jayam Ravi and Arvind Swami respectively. A brilliantly crafted thriller with intelligent screenplay and terrific narration,Thani Ourvan is a delightful original offering from Raja who's know for remaking successful films from other languages down south.The screenplay by director himself and the writer duo Subha framed upon the cat and mouse chase between protagonist and the villain is immensely stylish and substantial,being successful in gaining attention of the viewers who gets to be a part of the proceedings. There isn't a single dull moment in around 160 minutes of the running time and leaving aside some minor glitches,Thani Oruvan stands out as one of the best thrillers ever produced in Kollywood for its racy script,powerful and meaningful dialogues,lack of unwanted elements aimed at masses,the brilliant performances and strong technical perfection.Unlike many thrillers produced in the recent past,the romance portions were well-written and Raja deserves a special applause for handling it convincingly so that it never turn a stumbling block in the thrills offered by the enthralling fight between the hero and the villain. Jayam Ravi has comeup with a top-notch performance as the protagonist Mithran IPS and showcases his mettle in handling intense roles with ease.Expecting more such roles from him rather than disappointing ones like Shakti from 'Sakalakala Vallavan Appatakkar'. Casting Aravind Swami as the suave,intelligent and cool antagonist worked out wonders and he stole the show with his matured act.Arvind's character Siddharth Abhimanyu will be long-remembered as one of the best villainous portrayals in the history of tamil film industry.Welcome Back Swami!! Choose Wisely and you are here to stay !! <3 Thambi Ramaiah managed to evoke laughs with his hilarious portrayal of Sengalvarayan.Nayan Thara as the heroine was convincing in a neatly written role and pulled off her part really well.The supporting cast that includes Rahul Madhav,Ganesh Venkatraman etc were good. Music and score by Hip-Hop Tamizha were effective and gave more depth to the narration.All the songs were perfectly placed and avoiding unnecessary item songs and other unwanted numbers proved good for tightening the screenplay.Frames by Rajaji were slick and cuts by Gopi Krishna were neat. Overall,Thani Oruvan is a stylish and captivating thriller,a must watch this season. Verdict:: Mind-blowing performances from Jayam Ravi and Arvind Swami backed up with a taut screenplay,technical brilliance,powerful dialogues and and an energetic score makes Thani Oruvan an easy addition to the list of best thrillers to come-out from Kollywood till date.Don't miss this one from theatres,Period!! Un Yedhiri Yaar Endru Sol..Nee Yaar Endru Solgiren B-)",
         "Excellent movie. Enjoyed the thriller and saw a very good tamil film after a long time...Great acting by Arvind and Ravi...Credit should be given to director Raja..Good concept and well narrated with no deviation..Raja should continue to do straight films, even if it takes a year. Talking of music, just loved \"kaadhal cricket\" song and the awesome voice of the singer. The last song was also good and peppy. Hope this will change the attitude of most of the tamil directors, as long as the story is good and well narrated, it will be a big hit. This also proves, a movie with unrealistic scenes and characters can be successful and in fact hugely successful movie. Big kudos to the entire Thani Oruvan team. All the best..",
         "Minimally the movie is a must watch experience for all class cinema lovers.Thriller,Action,Some piece of Social message. The movie has quite good characterization from the 1st level characters to the final level supporting characters are perfectly and beautifully mannered. Aravind Swamy portrays the villain character as 'Never before in Kollywood'.From his mannerism,body language,attitude he has shown much of evilness more than hat of the script wanted which suits the character perfectly. My favorite scene of the movie would be the pre-climax sequence where Siddarth Abimanyu (Character) hears to his father's words,The scene in the investigation room. The movie totally emphasizes our Indian society and a battle of a 'Single Man'(Thani Oruvan) who want to protect the society and a 'Single Man' Who knows only about 'Money' However, you have shown interest in the screenplay.The message of the movie will catch you surely! Go for it! There is no speed breaker & a perfect song placement The Villain's character is well designed and more special from other negative characters of Kollywood Cinema.This movie is totally different from M.Raja's earlier movies.Unexpected turnings and easily catch-able screenplay.The best movie of this kind \"GOOD vs EVIL\".You'll have no reason to hate this film. This movie is a 'Gem Of Tamil Cinema'. Must watch movie for all movie lovers.Don't Miss this Roller Coaster Ride :)",
         "Wow..... superb movie.... superb story.... superb acting.... new level to Tamil cinema... even though there are some fault in the story line... don't mind those things... total thriller and the whole credits goes to Siddharth Abhimanyu i mean Arvind Swamy. His acting was awesome and super characterization. On the whole this movie ll be a treat for everyone.. BGM is superb. music is very nice. Negative parts are there. but don't mind those things. Dialogues are superb. Over all acting performance is good. Aravind Samy plays the major part in this movie. If u want to watch the movie again that only for Aravind Samy performance. My rate for this movie is 9.7/10",
         "I don't know why this film is rated 8.6. This is a highly overrated Tamil film. The film lags from the beginning till the end. The film is full of unnecessary dialogues and scenes. Sometimes the film is so boring that you feel asleep. Never watch this movie. It is a time wasting movie.",
         "Imagine a cop, who keeps a SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable (?), Realistic, Time bound) goal to demolish one bigwig criminal in his lifetime and secretly maintains a R&D center to study the latter. He has a skill developed since his childhood to read media news between the lines and strongly believes every small-time crime news item appearing has at its back hidden an organised crime. His skills of reading between lines, connecting the dots & of course the never dying passion, brings him into the battleground with one Siddarth. Also imagine a criminal, who plans more on covering himself from the crimes he masterminds, than on the crime itself. He is one helluva opportunist, who takes birth in a minister's car with the siren on, does an unimaginable cease of an opportunity at age 15, and controls the powerhouse of politics, business and research together through his allies and alas, he is a renowned scientist. His smooth flow gets perturbed on one Dec. 10, when his plan to discourage announcement of generic drugs by a swiss pharma owner lady gets deviated for a while, and he is in the battleground with our cop Mitran. Thani Oruvan is likable for every aspect of it. I generally judge a Director's capacity in creating the unique personality for his characters and ensuring the character maintains the same throughout the plot. M Raja & SuBa get 5 star on this aspect. The way the traits of both Ravi & Aravind are etched and maintained through shows the efficiency. Aravind Swamy (of Roja fame) is a real discovery in the role of Antagonist (or should we say, the protagonist? I wonder, why not?). He will actually make us like the villain of the movie more than the hero. Quiet a contrary. The crisp & slow delivery of simple, yet powerful dialogues between him & his father (played by Thambi Ramayya) are treat. Of course, Ravi & Nayantara have done their best as usual. Never loses curiosity. No loopholes in the story. No mediocrity in production values. Limited but essential use of CG. Lot of research has gone in to connect current affairs to hypothesis. In conclusion, its not everyday we get such treat from Indian movie makers...get yourself feasted...",
         "I was absolutely dumbstruck after watching this movie. I just can't believe that it so flawlessly written and executed. Hats off to the script writer and director. Aravind Swamy- What an actor!! Superb and so convincing. He is a treat to eyes. Total package of acting, dignity, good looks and most importantly STYLE. Superb. Aravind Swamy in his role was the best and am sure none other than him could have done it better and carried the role at the required level of dignity. Excellent casting. Very meticulous of director, actors and script. Excellent scripting, flawless execution by actors. Hats off to the whole team. The scenes and sequences are so well arranged and timely that I didn't want to take my eyes off the screen even to wink.",
         "from remake raja to m raja. yes, thats what people used to call the director of this film before thani oruvan. this is a path breaking film for not just m.raja but in Tamil cinema. everything was good. you cant point out any mistakes in the film. close to perfect. the script, oh my... the film is so good that you would want to watch it again and again. definitely, one of the best action thrillers in tamil cinema. this is one of those films where the villain is given supremacy for most of the time. arvind swamy nailed it as siddharth abhimanyu, he is the kind of negative shade people would like to be. cool as cucumber. music is apt and deserves a special mention and it resembles the contribution to what dark knight(2008) was. Thani oruvan joins the list of my all time favorites such as KO, thuppakki.",
         "and here comes another Tamil movie that doesn't have the masala and unbelievable fights as in singam 1 2 pokkiri etc. A class movie with class actors such as Arvindsamy and Jayam Ravi. Unbelievable scripting. Amazing Dialogues. The essence of the movie is Hero vs Villain as always but the way its shown is really a new stle for Tamil Cinema. Another addition to the set of unforgettable must watch movies such as Thuppaki, Vaaranam Ayiram, kaaka kaaka, dhill,vetaiyaadu vilaiyaaduetc. A must watch for all. No unnecessary songs, no unnecessary mass punches and theme music, no fights where the hero hits 20 people to the heights of 20 ft. a simple yet simply awesome cop movie.",
         "Thani Orwan is real awesome movie..loved its story and screenplay ...dont see much of Tamil cinema but this ones a good start...loved Arwind Swamt as stylish baddie super acting read a lot about it on the web ...its one of best movies i have seen of late with good content and execution...must watch for all fans of classic Arwind Swamy whose back after hiatus after Roja Snd Bombay... screen play is real pacy which makes it interesting and not boring throhgh out the movie and Nayanthara and Jayam Ravi did well too in their parts..Director who remade telugu movies and score blockbuster brings out a original story and wins evety one ..the best thriller i saw in recent times theme of the movie is real good and engaging and keeps you glued to your seats till the end",
         "There are so so many things that could have been done better, but hey let me take the time to say a great step in the right direction. If you are someone who is not willing to be emotionally indulged and love a social subject with a bit of typical cinematic stuff, then yes this is it, you may not get many such movies please watch. Personally I would like movie makers to control the itch to add the artificial fights and the out-of-screenplay songs. Imagine the depth of the movie without those and a bit more of logical screenplay wow, then we are talking of a masterpiece. But it was a genuinely good feeling coming out of the movie and yes not everyone in the audience would enjoy a total logical package so I think its a class 1 entertainer and Arvind Swamy and Ravi have done exceedingly well. The lead actress Nayanthara to her credit also supports very well to the plot. Must watch!",
         "Thani Oruvan - An excellent stalemate between two born-genius, destined to be polar opposites, redefining one another. I'd like to view Thani Oruvan as not a rip-off of Death Note, but it really reminds me of the anime series. Interaction between Siddharth Abhimanyu (Arvind Swamy) vs Mithran (Ravi) give me Death-Note-deja-vu, feud of L and Light (Kira). I haven't done much research about \"Thani Oruvan\". If the film's story is original, I'd be happy that it is and we got to see it first. Yo to Hiphop Tamizha - Adhithya. :) *Thani Oruvan - An excellent Movie. *Siddharth Abhimanyu - Coolest Villain to the core. *Ravi - Equally impressive. One to remember from Mohan Raja.",
         "Excellently scripted by Raja, and well enacted by Ravi, Arvind Swamy and others. Right from the first scene, the director makes you think.",
         "Finally we have an original screenplay and idea from Mohan Raja, and a great one at that. Thani oruvan narrates the story of Mithran, a cop who becomes obsessed with bringing down India's most corrupt businessman, Sidharth Abhimanyu and displays the psychological cat and mouse game that enfolds. Although its presented as usual in the good versus evil form the underlying political core of this film was very intriguing: The invisble but ever looming connection between seemingly small street crimes, media, politicians and businessmen. Here, M.Raja explores the decaying corruption of the pharmaceutical industry. The pace of the film is very fast paced, and rarely lags, constantly putting the audience into situation after situation where we see the psychological battle between Mithran and Sidharth Abhimanyu play out, with building tension, suspense and sudden twists. The opening scene of the film itself is very unique and establishes an unexpected character in the film.Likewise the film builds to an unexpected but impactful climax. Yes, sometimes the film becomes preachy, with Jayam Ravi giving passionate monologues, however this doesn't take away too much from the film. The dialogues in general are very crisp and striking. The charachterisation in this film is mostly good. Whereas Sidharth Abhimanyu is a trendsetting villain who will undoubtedly go down as one of the most badass villains in tamil cinema, the same cannot be said of Mithran's character. Mithran's character is slightly more fleshed out than other cliched Do gooder heroes of Kollywood. We see glimpses of his obsession to bring down Sidharth Abhimanyu, particularly in an intense scene where he almost destroys his own apartment searching for a bug. However this obsession could have been more fleshed out to the extent that Mithran himself ends up making morally questionable decisions to arrest his personally assigned enemy. Jayam Ravi's performance is good but lies in the shadow of Arvind Swamy's understated and badass performance as Sidharth Abhimanyu, a ruthless, calculating, manipulative and opportunistic businessman. The supporting cast are also good and help to progress the narrative. Especially Rahul Madhav as Jana, Nasser as the chief minister and Thambi Ramaiah are very good. Nayanthara isnt a cliched heroine just there for commercial purposes. Although her role is more commercial (as usual a duet but at least only one) at least her character had a role and was more integrated into the story, and her performance was good so the romance portion wasn't too irritating or irrelevant. Hip Hop Tamizha's music is very good, the songs are catchy and memorable and the bgm is excellent, especially Theemai dhan vellum and \"Thani Oruvan\" both themes are brilliant and emit expected vibes; Dark and badass, and Awesome in a motivating way. Technically the film is sound. The editing is great and so is the cinematography especially with the colour tones and shades. Overall, Thani oruvan is a film one can watch many times and is racy, sleek and thrilling, featuring a stellar comeback from Arvind Swamy as well as politically astute themes,",
         "One of the best screenplay deadly villainism bgm just perfect",
         "For a long time, Tamil Cinema wanted to see an Antagonist who is brainy rather than being brawny since the villain roles have become very much clichéd in the movies where the antagonist would be there just make sure the protagonist is shown and lauded as Hero for his daredevilry. Thani Oruvan (2015) directed by M.Raja with story from Subha brought a new and promising premise of battle between Good and Bad where the Villain would Act and the Hero would react. This movie was a career defining movie for Jayam Ravi playing Mithran IPS ( one of his best character roles in recent years ) and mainly Arvind Swamy who aced the role of Siddarth Abhimanyu just icing the character on the screen with panache and charisma who finally ended up being the show stealer on the movie. The title justifies the Protagonist and Antagonist as a Single Person who traverse on different paths for which seems to be the right one for them and they do succeed on the same with their own thought process paving the way for the same.Like they say a Great Hero needs a Greater Villain, here the same was followed and succeeded. The intensity in Mithran's character is the exact balance of the moral anger inside him and his anxiety to snitch his most prized target ;Siddarth Abhimanyu. The movie when seen from a Social Angle depicts that all small crimes and antisocial acts are just a fitting piece of puzzle in a bigger picture which is completely blindfolded by the Megalomaniacs and Corporate Giants from the eyes of common man. The movie emphasized on how the minor and major events are interlinked and relatively affecting the lives of the common public without disrupting their daily lives. Coming to the movie, the movie's success is a complete Teamwork from all ends. The most important factor was the Character Design and Depiction on screen which hit the ball out of the park. Siddharth Abhimanyu's character is always cool, never loses his calm and temper, never shouts lines in decibels instead handles all matters in phone calls with a Bluetooth headset always with him. By this he always outshines all the hurdles and threats posed by the Protagonist. The dialogues are placed pitch perfect for the characters and the situations that it does not seem like the they were placed intentionally to spice up the scene. Some of the best scenes would the one when Mahima (played by Nayanthara ) advises Mithran that his anxiety has become his addiction which is killing him slowly and the one where Siddarth Abhimanyu gets to know about Mithran, instead of going for the big kill decides to bring him down morally. This movie is one such rare gem in Tamil Cinema that it will be always remain eternal for its theme, making and presentation on screen with class and style. This movie was the game changer for Jayam Raja and Jayam Ravi and also gave a confidence that good story can always make good cinema when presented unadulterated.",
         "I learned quite some of the essential life skills form this Movie which is needed for striving and thriving in this world, from both characters Siddharth Abhimanyu and Mithran IPS. We have to play both the characters in our life and I'm sure it helps, check it out!! The dialogues are really good and few are valuable ones, from Siddharth, Mitran and Mahima. The story line is fabulous, and what makes the movie great is the acting of Siddharth and his role( Excellentone) which I've never seen in Tamil movies currently and the screenplay.",
         "This is definitely your regular Indian style film, but the script was top notch, that's the vast difference you would find in this. It was a cop-thief clash theme something like the Korean film 'Veteran'. Initially I thought it might be a remake of some Korean film, because it looks like a Korean thriller, but after learning that it was an original, I was amazed. Because, you know, the director has a nick name called remake Raja. He's known for bringing the Telugu blockbuster to the Kollywood. That's not bad and I'm not against remakes, he sure did do a wonderful job with those projects to succeed. The actors were brilliant, especially like everybody saying Aravaind Swamy in a negative role stole the show. The plus point was minimizing the musical track. I mean the narration was not interrupted by unexpected and unnecessary musics and dances like usual Indian films does, except on one occasion I think. The two and half an hour was too long, but that's the average Indian film length and totally worth it. Not easy to predict, but in a few segments you would know what might come in the next scene. Because it might be an awesome film for the Indian audience who are seeing it for the first time, but in the world stage it is just an above average with partial cliché. There were a couple twists, the ending was excellent too, and looks like a follow up might come. My only disappointment was they missed a wonderful opportunity to make this film more realistic in the line of 'Unnaipol Oruvan'. Instead, they opted to narrate it more commercially appealing way. So if you are an Indian or watch regularly Indian films, you would find it great. I was impressed with the film's promotions and it did well at the box office. Now it is getting remade in a couple of other languages, I hope they would as well do well. The brothers; the lead actor and the director did many projects together, but this one was a very special and will be a game changer for their respective career. So you might need to check it out if you haven't seen it yet. I'm not saying it is a masterpiece, but if you know Indian cinemas, then would learn how unusual it is. 7/10"
