         "Kurukshetra is a Great Action movie with serious stuff. It tells the story of a Good Cop who faces tough problems after he arrests a man who rapes a innocent girl. The Man, being the son of the Chief Minister has the power to get released. The movie follows a battle between honest Police and corrupt politicians. There are some great serious stuff in this movie. Sanjay Dutt delivers a Brilliant performance as he usually does. Mahima Choudhury looks sexy as ever, who cares for her acting. Om Puri is terrific as the corrupt Chief Minister. The supporting cast have all done a great job especially the constable for Sanjay Dutt. The storyline has been repeated a few times like Hulchul and Ardh Satya etc. This is one of the best versions. The songs are quite nice especially Aap ka Ana. This is highly recommended for Bollywood Action fans.",
         "Sanjay Dutt plays a cop that stands up for what is right. He plays a modern day Dirty Harry in this movie and he does an excellent job. Om Puri also does an excellent job and his lines are hilarious. This movie is excellent, but the story line is average. If you like Mission Kashmir, you should see this.",
         "One of the epic movie of the year 2000. It is the perceptible dictation of the politics that we have seen in independent India. Incredible effort to introduce the real picture of scandalous politicians. All aspects of a good movie i.e. Action, drama, thrill and many more has been touched intelligently. The real Kurukshetra of today's era has been shown. Unfortunately we are yet to learn from it.",
         "While this film is replete with romantic scenes, musical songs as well as Action-packed dialogues and powerful 1-liners, the title of this movie should have been either KROOKSHETRA or KUKUKSETHRA. There are unnecessary item songs, romantic scenes, melodious duets as well as extended action scenes in this move which interrupt the flow of this well-directed,well- made movie. THIS MOVIE IS A GOOD FOLLOW-UP TO VIDHU VINOD CHOPRA's Mission Kashmir, which was released prior to this movie in the Diwali month of 2000. In this movie, Sanjay DUTT plays ACP Prithviraj Singh, a honest police officer, who always finds himself single handed fighting against the criminal, anti-social elements which have the support of the powerful, corrupt politicians and an opportunistic,money-minded group of police officers. The music and songs of this movie are very good, too. \"Aapka Anna \", \"JAANAM TERE LIYE \" & \"ARJUN HAI THU\" r very ears-pleasing songs. It so happens that the corrupt, chief minister (OM PURI) misuses his political powers on a regular basis that his son AMBAR takes the law for granted and rapes his own personal secretary along with his best male friend. How ACP PRITHVIRAJ SINGH , who's been given this case solves this issue by keeping the important documentary evidences with him to prove the guilty chief minister's son a criminal in the court of law is the story of this movie. MAHIMA CHAUDHARY deserved more footage as well as a bigger role in this movie. SALIL ANKOLA, the ex- Indian international one-day cricketer makes his silver screen debut with this movie. Sunidhi Chauhan, Alka Yagnik, RAVINDRA Sathe and Kumar Sanu have all sung songs very nicely for this movie. Definitely, this movie is worth watching at least once in a lifetime. Mahima Chaudhury is very gorgeous, in this movie while SALIL ANKOLA puts up an above- average performance. OM PURI, SAYAJI SHINDE & SHIVAJI SATAM have all acted very well in this movie too. Sanjay DUTT was nominated for best actor in a leading role for this movie in 3 different awards functions- 2000 FILMFARE awards, 2000 Lux Zee Cine Awards and 2000 Screen Videocon Awards."
