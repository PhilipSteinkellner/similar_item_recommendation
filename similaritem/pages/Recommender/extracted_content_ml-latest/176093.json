         "I rather liked Opus I, II and III when I came across them, but for some reason -- perhaps I was getting a little tired on this occasion after having seen II, III and IV consecutively in a batch! -- I didn't find this one so enjoyable. The flow of the shapes seemed more arbitrary and less subconsciously fascinating, and it was all starting to look a bit the same. Basically this is a similar piece to the others in the series: shapes of a fluid or a jagged nature appear from either side of the screen, swell up, chase each other and occasionally, thanks to the tints applied to the film print, change colour. It didn't seem to have quite such a fortuitous rhythm to it, though, and I found myself starting to get bored. I wonder if the longer running time (Opus IV was shown at approximately one minute longer than its predecessors) was implicated.",
         "This is \"Opus IV\", the 4th and final entry to Walter Ruttmann's Opus series. It runs considerably shorter than the first and roughly as long as parts 2 and 3, namely slightly under 4 minutes. However, in terms of the ideas here, I found it the least creative of the series. It feels somewhat monotone and uninspired. I felt change, movement in the other films, but this one here is almost static compared to these. This 90-year-old film was the last entry to the series and I guess that is a good thing as the magic, if there ever was any, is gone completely. Not a good watch by any means, actually pretty boring and you must really like the previous installments a lot to appreciate this one. i did not. Thumbs down."
