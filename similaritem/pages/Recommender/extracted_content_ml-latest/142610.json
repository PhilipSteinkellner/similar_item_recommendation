      "reviews": ["I don't speak much Spanish and the subtitles at the screening I went to left a lot to be desired (badly done, not able to keep up with what was happening on screen). That said, I think this film is extraordinary. As someone who comes from a small country town I can empathise with the boredom felt by these teenagers who all long for some adventure outside of the squares that define their lives. At its heart, the film is about breaking out of the confines of the squares we place ourselves in (or are placed into), and shaking up the status quo when the status quo makes no sense, or exists only to service those who would abuse their position. Samuel Galiardo is a relative newcomer as the protagonist \"Carlos\", but he carries the film with the subtlety of a seasoned pro. He's going to go places either on the back of this film or his next one. His supporting cast ground the film around him, and the steady direction from Alvaro Begines delivers a story that is forgiving of the actions of its characters as it seeks to examine the boundaries of personal ethics and its own sense of justice."],
