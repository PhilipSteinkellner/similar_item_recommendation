         "This movie is one of my favorites! All of the characters are hilariously developed and the actors who play them do a wonderful job. I've loved this movie since I was a kid and every once in a while I quote from it or think of one of the characters (my favorite being Delores). It's a shame that more people haven't heard of this movie. It's somewhat hard to find but if you seek it out it is well worth it!",
         "The Class of 1972 from Lizzie Borden High (nyuk, nyuk) is all gathering together for their ten-year reunion. All those guys you remember are back. The jock, ms. Popular, the cripple, the nobody, the class pump, the girl who sold her soul to the devil so she could get rid of leg braces and now breathes fire and has an Exorcist thing going on and let's not forget Howard Baylor. Baylor escaped from the loony bin just to get back at the poor slobs who pulled the senior prank on him (he made-out with his twin sister) and put him there to begin with. All that and a National Lampoon charter to boot\u0085Whoa Nelly! Certainly not the most popular National Lampoon film (it's got a serious reputation for being bad) but I actually had fun with it. It moved at a pretty fast pace with enough bad jokes and screwiness to keep me entertained. Give it a view. \"National Lampoon's Class Reunion\" may grow on you like that rash you got from gym.",
         "This should be a classic--it was made during the height of both 80's slashers and sex-comedies. It had a great cast (Stephen Furst as well as two great underused, but always fascinating actresses--Zane Busby as a weirdly compassionate and helpful woman possessed by the devil, and chipmunk-voiced Mews Small as a blind nympho had a lot of potential) and the budget looked reasonable. And it's inoffensive enough--it's doesn't inspire one to seek out the director and hang him with his own celluloid strips like, say, \"Up The Academy\" did. It's just not that interesting. It's like a bad 80's sitcom pilot that you forget five minutes after the credits roll. It's something you watch with a hangover in a marathon of similarly themed movies on cable, falling asleep frequently without fear of having \"missed anything.\" It has a few chuckles here and there, and the attempt to simulate the slashers of the era is appreciated. It's probably no dumber than others of its kind. It's just bland and lifeless, like a bored jellyfish. I'm about to fall asleep writing about it. I suddenly can't even remember why I wanted to...",
         "I had no idea what to expect from this movie. It was just being showed on HBO and I thought, what the heck! I won't say I regret I saw it, but I can't say I am delighted that I watched it. It wasn't a good movie, it was dumb, but...but...unlike \"Mistery Men\", for example, it made me feel better. SPOILERS The story is about the craziest people one might see who celebrate some kind of reunion. One of the ex-students though plans revenge on his former \"mates\", who played a \"terrible\" prank on him at the end of school. So he goes on a killing spree and some people die, but of course, it's all a comedy, so it's not a big deal... The movie did remind me of Scary Movie though...I don't know why, but I felt it was kind of a parody to scary movies to come. The characters are all very predictable. The one who is least known gets to be the \"hero\", the one who has the best reputation shows his own \"disgraced\" side, the good looking chick is kidnapped, etc. It was funny at times and what is most important it did not bore me. Probably will bore others...not me though. I doubt you can \"think deep\" on this movie because I doubt it was made for this purpose. It's not worth renting, but if you have a wasted day it might just cheer you up. 4.5/10",
         "A mostly unfunny, one-joke spoof on the high school / slasher sub-genre that got to me not because of the lack of laughs, but to just how tediously uninteresting the story felt. I found the two stoner buddies (Barry Diamond and Art Evans) amusing enough and so of Gerry Graham's mannered performance along with Anne Ramsey's grouchy cafeteria worker. However for most part I found it a hard task to sit through, trying not to fast-forward (yep I was watching it on a VHS tape). Deliberately goofball in tone --- it keeps its quips quite crude, where the running gags only get repetitively stale and even embarrassing. The material was penned by John Hughes, where he sets up the situation quite well enough but then does nothing then rely on its random, if witlessly lacklustre occurrences and disappointingly screwed-up conclusion. The silly plot sees the class of 72 returns to their old rundown high school Lizzie Borden High for a reunion, but they are soon terrorised by a former student that recently escaped the loony bin seeking revenge for the prank that put him there. Michael Miller's direction is gimmicky, but the low-scale execution holds up better than it should and there's a high-energy soundtrack to boot. The cast is made-up of colourful, over-the-top characters; Michael Lerner, Misty Rowe, Miriam Flynn, Stephen Furst and Mews Small.",
         "Campy, silly but all out fun, the Lizzie Borden class of '72 will make you wish you were in on some of the \"fun\" they have! You have your snooty playboy and his equally as snooty girlfriend, your prissy class prude who just happened to be as popular as she was snotty, the class cretin, a devil worshipper and a vampire and they all make for a hilarious \"class.\" Gerrit Graham is great as Bob Spinnaker the class playboy who has his nose so far up in the air if it were to rain, he would drown. Stephen Furst is typical in his role, as only he can do and make it look convincing as the cretinous, perverted Hubert Downs who hasn't changed much since High School and Miriam Flynn is such a prude in her role as the snide Bunny Packard that you wish someone would slap her. Zane Buzby puts in one hilarious performance as Delores Salk, a cripple who sold her soul to the devil in order to not be crippled any longer. Enter Michael Lerner as Doctor Robert Young, a psychiatrist who tries to help solve all the mysterious murders that begin happening and you have side splitting twists, turns and action until the very end of the movie. Great fun and with a guest appearance by music legend Chuck Berry, great music too!",
         "You can't convince someone to like this movie. I found the image of a high school class singing The Supremes over the ornate corpse of a Krishna to be comically endearing. I also liked the image of Scatman Caruthers bicycling through flying sausages in \"Zapped!\" with Scott Baio; neither of these films can be called excellent, but each has a tepid silliness which is pleasant. Gerrit Graham and Michael Lerner make memorable characters, and the rest are painless. 'Painless' is a high rating for any as jaded as I. Never having read the original lampoon concept, and never having seen a 'John Hughes' film prior to this one (it is hard to recognize John Hughes in here - although the film takes place in a high school, the characters are all adults) I thought it was at least as funny as Animal House, which I never really found that funny.",
         "This movie is probably my favorite movie of all time. Miriam Flynn is excellent as Bunny Packard. Zane Buzby as Delores is comic genius. The rest of the cast is amazing, and the film is really really funny. A definite satire of horror films, with a zany twist. If you enjoy a fun, comedy filled evening, then go and rent this classic. You'll laugh all the way through!",
         "Personal taste rules when it comes to talking about movies such as this treasured little gem. Way back in the eighties, the early eighties, i discovered this movie, like so many released at the time, \"Night Patrol\" \"Bad Manners\" or even \"King Frat\" the artwork and blurbs on the back of the covers tempted and teased you. Of course being of an age, movies like that i have already mentioned as well as stuff like \"Screwballs\" and the many others, captured the imagination, and thankfully many years later i still remember some with fondness and some with disdain the many movies that help maintain my love of such genre as parodies or pastiches. Made many years after the huge success of \"Animal House\" and having seen how it had fared down through the years, I now know that there would be no way this movie would ever eclipse the box office bucks obtain aforementioned nor would it linger in the memory, much like that of National Lampoon's Vacation. To be honest, not everything that has carried the National Lampoon Logo has been a wild success, however to me Class Reunion remains one of my all time favourite movies, with instantly recognisable characters, such as the aloof Bob Spinnaker played to perfection by Gerrit Graham, so good in Charles Band's \"Terrorvision\" still lingering in the past glories of his youth. Or how about Stephen Furst's brash and ballsy turn as the high school lazy drunken sex crazed bum Hubert Downs. Sweet as. Which makes me ponder. As i already said, personal taste not withstanding. People can be so cruel, so it will never win any awards or be compared to the like of its's peers within the comedy world. It does have some merit. Being one of the earlier scripts penned by John Hughes, who would later go on to do one of my own favourites of his work \"Weird Science\" as well as having a wonderful theme title sung by the great Gary U.S Bonds. What more can i say, it's a movie just waiting to be rediscovered, time and time again.",
         "Gerrit Graham is a great actor....but he can not star in a movie. Much like football, Gerrit has the talent to run the ball in for a touchdown but can't. However, he is a guarantee 3 points every game. Here, Gerrit is good but does nothing as the star of the movie. The entire cast has there moments, but nothing worth keeping your attention for an entire 90 minutes. The movie at times seems too low budget to be anything great like Animal House or Chritmas Vacation. The story is pure humor, nothing but quick and sometimes witty fart jokes that only make you laugh for a second or two. Nudity is added just for pure laughs, nothing terrific. All in all, it is a quick comedy with nothing to show for it. The movie starts out good with a potential story but ends quick and corny."
