         "Okay, okay, I'll grant that this is NOT a Steven Seagal action movie. That's fine. Seagal's action movies are no great shakes anyway. This is instead a virus-outbreak scientific drama. Fine. Trouble is, the level of science in this movie is about second-grade or less. The disease is something viral. A character announces early in the movie, as the outbreak begins, that people are going to start dying in 1-2 days. However, many days go by and many characters are exposed to the virus, but the only ones who actually die are the ones that the script needs to die to show that several different experimental cures didn't work. A character says this particular virus is 10 times as lethal as anthrax. With the mortality rate in this movie, if anthrax is one-tenth as lethal, anthrax must be about as awful as a sneezing fit. \"Universal precautions\" is the term that describes how health care workers prevent the spread of disease between patients (and to the workers themselves). It means that ALL patients are considered to be contagious. So health care workers wear gloves when touching all patients and change between patients, and masks when anything might be in the air, and eye protectors when they might be splashed, etc. In \"The Patriot\", the government anti-viral team wears moonsuits from \"Outbreak\", while every other character takes ZERO precautions. Doctors don't wear gloves to handle patients with bloody vomit all over themselves. Nurses don't wear masks around patients with hacking coughs. Dumb, dumb, dumb...",
         "1/2 out of **** The Patriot harkens back to the good old days of Steven Seagal's preachiness, and in this latest outing of his, I think it's arguable we may have come across his worst movie yet (keep in mind, I have not seen The Foreigner or Half Past Dead). Bear in mind, worst may be negligible in comparison to the rest of his filmography, but this one just about edges out the rest. The premise is pretty simple; Seagal is Wesley McClaren, a small town doctor who's concerned over the spread of a recent epidemic that's killing the town's population at a rapid rate. The military have the place quarantined, but are unaware that the outbreak was caused by a militia group led by Floyd Chisolm (Gailard Sartain). Anyway, Chisolm himself is infected, but can't find the cure, so he takes over the town, and discovers someone who's immune, and (gasp!), it's McClaren's own daughter! Naturally, McClaren doesn't take kindly to Chisolm's men putting their hands on her, so a slugfest will ensue. As of now, The Patriot is probably the most incompetently written script for a Seagal film, and that alone says quite a bit. The basic premise holds a kernel of interest, but it's riddled with baffling writing. Let me get this straight, Chisolm started the infection because he can't stand the government, meaning to cause an epidemic that will devastate the population. He allowed himself to be infected because he has the cure, but it turns out this cure only slows the virus down. When he discovers this little factoid, he and his men decide to shoot down the military occupying the small town so they can take the government manufactured cure (which turns out not to be any different than their own). What?! If he believed the military had a cure the whole time, why'd he even bother spreading the infection in the first place, and in such a desolate area, where infection would hardly cause that much a ruckus. That's just the beginning of the story's flaws. When it's stated that only McClaren's daughter isn't infected, they never bother to check the father for any signs of antibodies. Also visually noticeable is the fact that McClaren is not even the slightest bit sick, which he himself fails to note as an oddity. (From here on out, I plan to give out spoilers). Anyway, it turns out certain flowers are the cure for the disease, which explains why McClaren's daughter and his Native American father-in-law are never sick, because they're around these petals all the time. It's at this point the movie goes preachy on us, trying to force feed us a ham-fisted theme about how all of modern technology can't find a cure when a simple Native American remedy can. Seagal even says that it \"took an old Blackfoot Indian to figure it out,\" which is actually incorrect, considering that the cure was accidentally discovered and that the Native American father-in-law didn't actually figure it out himself. To also suddenly deny the miracles of technology is pretty stupid, given that the modern world HAS discovered many cures for what were previously considered incurable illnesses. These inconsistencies could be partially forgiven if the movie was in any way thrilling or exciting, but this is among the most boring action films in recent memory. The fight scenes are typical Seagal, meaning nobody lays so much as a finger on him and the fights last no more than a few seconds. Several action sequences lack credibility, the most obvious one being how the militia group could actually take over a town guarded by highly trained U.S. military. Usually, most action movies try to end with a bang, to conclude with an all-out action setpiece. The Patriot does not, as it wraps things up with a shootout that lasts less than a minute. This film was a thirty-five million dollar production, where did all the money go? Certainly not in the action or the sets, which all look standard and sometimes rather cheap. Comparing this to recent, less expensive top-notch action films such as Equilibrium and The Transporter, The Patriot looks like a complete waste of cash based on visuals alone. But there's a story here, too, and it drags this abysmal movie down even further.",
         "I think this movie is given a bad wrap because it does not have non-stop bone crunching action and because the villains are stereotyped and the plot lines are predictable and ridiculous. Anyways, Seagal is Dr Wesley McClaren, one of the best immunologists in the USA. But he works as more of a nature medicine practitioner in a small mid-western town. His best friend, Frank, is a cowboy style guy played by L Q James. McClaren also has a daughter and a father who is full blooded Indian and lives in an isolate cabin in the mountains. The arch villain here is the neo nazi white trash survivalist, Floyd Chisolm, played by Gailord Sartain. Chisolm is strangely able to get a hand on a super potent biological weapon, and assuming that the anti dote they have will keep them safe, he unleashes this stuff on his own townspeople. Immediately the army is alerted and seal off the place. So Seagal retreats to a super secret laboratory in the mountains (sick!)where he battles to find an anti dote. Not surprisingly the anti dote turns out to be a herb flower that indians has used for centuries. Not much action yet, and not much you will get until Chisolm gets desperate and sends his \"soldiers\" to kidnap Seagal and his daughter. Supposedly McClarens daughter is immune because she has native blood. Frank is killed in this process, leaving Seagal no choice but to put Chisolm out of his misery. This is done in a pretty interesting scene where Chisolm invites the kidnapped Seagal for a glass of Bordeaux wine. Seagal responds by talking calmly about what a piece of trash Chisolm is before breaking his wine class with his thumb and index finger and forcing the broken glass into the man's skull. Priceless! To end it off on a high note the army does not go house to house delivering anti dote in capsules or syringes, no, they sprinkle the flowers out from helicopters hovering the town. The director is Dean Semler, the man behind so diverse films as Bruce Almighty, Dead Calm, Young Guns and Cocktail. If it was not for Seagal and the director this would be a piece of trash too, but strangely, I liked it.",
         "\"The Patriot\" staring Steven Segal is a late 90's thriller/action movie that is not really a thriller and not really an action movie; rather it is Steven Segal playing Steven Segal by another name, but this time he is a Native American country doctor who kicks butt every now an again. Baring the obvious plot line holes, the movie itself is absolutely amazing in terms of the blatant disregard for character devolvement. From a marketing standpoint, I was left asking myself, \"who in the world were they aiming at?\" The bio-thriller plot-line is way off the mark for the middle America crowd and Segal as silk cowboy would never sell to anyone even if you deep fried him and put him between a kripsy-cream donut. The whole movie is just way out there, even for Segal fans, because it simply does not deliver on any level.",
         "Being an avid Steven Seagal fan, I must say that this film, in some important aspects, is an improvement on earlier efforts. Mr. Seagal's acting in \"The Patriot\" shows a widening of his abilities, not everyone can act together with a child and still come out first or at least equal. Likewise, he shows his audience that he can convey broader emotions and not just squint and knit his brows. Secondly, the photography is impressive, even though there is much riding around to and fro in landscape scenes. What ultimately brings \"The Patriot\" down a few notches on my scale is the narrative. The story is told in a disjointed way, making persons suddenly appear or disappear as if they were props, they are too shallow. The story moves in small fits and stops, ultimately making it seem like an \"Outbreak Lite\" (which incidentally uses the same premises as this film, substituting a monkey instead of right wing militia), the martial arts sequences seem tacked on and I imagine Seagal action fans will be disappointed by their scarcity. Mr. Seagal is first and foremost an action star, and to remove himself from this (albeit narrow) genre implies some fancy footwork. Here, the fight sequences seem unnatural and included just to please the fans. The symbolism involving Native Americans will mostly be lost on Norwegians at least, but the final scenes involving the military, is a gem. Summing up, I'd say that this is not Steven Seagal's worst film , but it would have been much better with a better narrative. The acting, locations and photography are, together with the story, very good and its environmental message is much better handled than in his earlier effort, \"On Deadly Ground\". It would have been interesting to look at what ended up on the cutting room floor. Now all I wait for is the next hi-quality and intelligent action movie (!) from Mr.Seagal while applauding his efforts to broaden his scope. I just don't think it's going to happen with this movie, which ultimately winds up on a more shallow level than the story and actors would leave you to expect.",
         "Wesley McClaren leaves the biological division of the CIA to become a small town doctor. When a group of American terrorists release a toxin into the air, it mutates and the vaccine becomes useless. McClaren becomes trapped in the town with the terrorists in a race to find a new vaccine. However when his daughter seems to be beating the toxin the terrorists decide to use her blood as a vaccine and McClaren is forced to protect her while seeking an alternative cure. This is yet another Seagal film where he preaches about his beliefs and promotes Native American culture etc. The down side of this is that it tends to overpower the action scenes - for example the last 10 minutes of `On Deadly Ground' was Seagal giving a lecture on big businesses impact on the environment. Here Seagal is battling a virus, so there's even less action - they wheel the terrorists in in an attempt to give Seagal some real people to fight. However there are no really good action scenes - which are the only thing Seagal can do well. In the place of action we have Seagal telling off scientists for storing diseases, telling everyone about the benefits of Native American ways etc. This makes the film feel very dull and wordy and I really wanted more action - but there just wasn't the chance for fights. Seagal isn't very good. He's looking old and podgy and less suited to the all round action man. The huge amount of talking scenes highlights Seagal's weaknesses as an actor. The terrorist leader is poor, but it is interesting to see LQ Jones (A Boy and His Dog) as Frank. However Seagal is really stretched. Overall this is poor - the threat of biological warfare is an interesting, emotive subject, but here it's hard to be interested due to Seagal forcing it down out throats. And the ending is hard to swallow and typical of Seagal's blind love for all things Native American.",
         "The Patriot (nothing to do with the Mel Gibson film of the same name) came out Steven Seagal was still doing that 'saving the environment' thing in his movies. Which is fine. But it doesn't make for good action. When the plot(?) of this film finally kicked in I saw the twist(?) coming a mile off. Seagal's anti-warfare, care-for-mother-nature stance is not very subtle. For a film that was originally going to debut in the cinemas it is shot very much like a TV movie despite some wonderful shots of the country by Dean Semler, the photographer of Dances with Wolves. Steven Seagal does like 1 fight scene in the entire film and it's totally boring. As an action film it fails, as a drama it stinks, as an environmental message it's obvious. Avoid like Ebola crossed with plague.",
         "There are only three movies that have shown Steven Seagal can act and this is one of them. Along with \"Fire Down Below,\" and \"The Glimmer Man\" Seagal has shown he has talent. Though there is not that much action, \"The Patriot\" is the best film because it means that the supporting cast along with Seagal must come together to pull off a winner. I enjoyed everything about this film from the plot, casting and pace of the movie. I was completely impressed by the performance of Camilia Belle who portrayed the daughter because she was a breath of fresh air to Hollywood even though she was in other films. This is worth everyone's attention because Steven Seagal has finally made a movie that is tolerable and can be watched in comfort with the knowledge that it will not be boring. I give \"The Patriot\" an 8 out of 10.",
         "OK...ths film (like Segal's last few films) once again goes beyond the \"knock 'em down, kick 'em in the groin, shoot 'em in the face, get revenge against the bad guys for hurting my sister's niece's cousin\" stuff Seagal was into for a while. Geepers, Steven started thinking, and using his bucks to make movies with actual ideas in them. SURE....there is plenty of action in this flick, but also some thought and heart. It's not an Oscar flick, but well worth the effort, unless the viewer is so into brain dead violence that it hurts to have to think for longer than a second. It's worth a rental..or two!!",
         "Basically, this is a very good film. It is very different from Seagal's other films though, which unfortunately may turn off some of his fans. Unlike some of the other films, this does not feel like a 'Seagal vehicle'. You get to see plenty of the other characters as well and all of Mr. Seagal's actions are not the same as we've seen before. The concept of him being an 'intellectual' in something other than bombs and other weaponry is a nice change. Although there are some unrealistic parts to the film (some more obvious than others), in general you can let them slide since the film is fun to watch. It boils down to this: If you are looking for a classic Seagal action film, sorry, but you're going to be disappointed. Watch it anyway for the fun of it. If you're open to seeing Seagal without the action, it's well worth a look. I personally believe it is some of the best work he's done in quite a while."

         "Doctor Wesley McClaren is an immunologist in Ennis, Montana, and he has turned down an offer to join his friend Richard Bach, who lives in Atlanta, Georgia, and is the head of a unit called the Biological Response Team (BRT). Wesley and his daughter Holly live on a farm in Ennis, and a farmhand named Frank lives with them. Just over the hill from the farm, a 52 day standoff against militia leader Floyd Chisolm has ended. Floyd has decided to be his own attorney in court. Everyone is shocked when Floyd spits on Judge Tomkins. After the hearing, Tomkins starts feeling sick. Holly, like she always does, stops at Wesley's office after school so she can go home with Wesley. On their way home, Wesley gets a call on his mobile phone. Wesley rushes to the hospital with Holly and tells her to wait in the doctors' lounge, then Wesley is taken to see Tomkins, who looks awful. Wesley is told that Tomkins collapsed in his chambers at the court building. Wesley sees a cop collapse, while Tomkins has a seizure. Wesley calls Richard and tells him to send the BRT. Army medical units are sent in, and Ennis is sealed off. Wesley tells Frank to stay in town instead of going to the farm, then Wesley tells Holly to stay where she is, because the town is dealing with an outbreak. Richard arrives in town and talks to Wesley, who knows that some kind of toxin has been released. Wesley asks Richard about an anti-toxin, then they go to Tomkins's room, where Tomkins has died. Richard tells Wesley that the toxin is a warfare product called NAM37, which is ten times more potent than anthrax. Richard also tells Wesley that a technician working for NAM37's developers stole a big sample of the NAM37 and was detained by security in Billings, Montana, one day after the NAM37 was sold to Floyd, but the technician killed himself before anyone could ask him any questions. After buying the NAM37, Floyd infected himself and started the outbreak by spitting on Tomkins. So far, 94 people have been infected, and the NAM37 has killed 5 people. Wesley takes a sample of Holly's blood, and Floyd is visited in jail by his right hand man and medical expert Nate Pogue, who has also been infected. and the anti-toxin Floyd bought along with the NAM37 only slows the NAM37 down instead of being a cure. Floyd's plan was to start the outbreak, then use the anti-toxin on himself. Floyd tells Pogue to get him out so they can get the anti-toxin that the army has brought into town. Later, a group of men led by Pogue return to the jail, where they kill all of the guards and get Floyd out. Floyd and Pogue go to the hospital with their men, and they take the hospital hostage in hopes of getting the anti-toxin, only to discover that the army's anti-toxin is the same anti-toxin Floyd bought. Richard explains that there have been times when NAM37 has mutated, and when it does, the anti-toxin doesn't work. Pogue sees Holly's blood sample and the sample shows that Holly has been infected, but somehow, she's okay and her body is fighting it off. Floyd wants Holly found. When one of Floyd's men finds Holly in the lounge and tries to grab her, Wesley beats the man up and goes to the farm with Holly and Frank. Floyd's men head to Wesley's farm, where Frank ambushes them and kills all of them except for one man, who kills Frank. Wesley and Holly take off with Frank's body, and ride their horses to a farm where Holly's Grandpa lives, and they give Frank a proper burial. Wesley takes a blood sample from his friend Ann, and just like Holly, Ann's body is fighting off the NAM37. Leaving Holly at her Grandpa's house, Wesley and Ann go to an underground lab that Wesley used to work in, where they plan to come up with a cure. Pogue, who is still at the hospital with Floyd, thinks he has found a cure, but he needs Holly's blood to isolate it. After Wesley finds the reason why Ann and Holly are not being affected by the virus, Wesley and Holly go home...where Holly is kidnapped by Floyd's men. Now Wesley must go to Floyd's headquarters and rescue Holly.",
