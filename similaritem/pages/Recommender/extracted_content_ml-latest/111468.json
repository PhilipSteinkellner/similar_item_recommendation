On a new case, she is brought back to the house near the lake where she was raised to help a group of environmentalists to protect its natural beauty against the industrial project of a power company. But by doing so she has to fight the greed of the locals, and their trust in an evil spirit that is believed to be attached to the lake.",

So this is a story full of mystery and fairy tales, very atmospheric, dark, and pretty much centered on the person of Julia, extremely well played by Krista Kosonen, that brings us to a surprising end. Overall, an interesting Finnish film."],
