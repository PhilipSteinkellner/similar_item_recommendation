      "reviews": ["Not seen many Kazakstanian movies, its fascinating to see that film really is an international language. This film is not only a retelling of Hemingways classic \"The old Man and the Sea\", its also an epic story about family relations and the modern age entering the old, as well as age difference imposing on relations. The old grandfather loves to watch football on his old TV, and the young grandchild is more into playing games on his Gameboy. The old man can't see any point in that, being a man of he old school. He was a thug back then, when he was young, but has forgotten in all his wisdom. Some hunter come by in their Hummer to hunt wolves, even if the old man says they mustn't now, when their cubs are new born. Still they go. The old man is to shepherd his flock of sheep, all names after great footballers, when he gets lost in the fog on the steppe, where the wolves rules. The film is beautifully shot as a survival drama. Very authentic from the poorer side of the rural Kazakhstan. We see the new world meeting the old, and still that there's more to traditions than we really think. The film grabs you both with its funny parts as well as the beautiful poetry in the telling of the story. Not literary, but as the story is told. Charming, lovely and simply great. Recommended!"],
