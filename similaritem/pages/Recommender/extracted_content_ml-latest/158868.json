      "reviews": ["I am NOT the sort of tourist that Vegas loves. I've been to Vegas and am going back very soon--and never, ever gamble. So, I did enjoy watching this show because it introduced me to a side of Las Vegas I've never really experienced. I just walk THROUGH the casinos in order to get to other places--and at just about all the Vegas hotels you are forced to walk through the casinos to get anywhere! Now I am not being sanctimonious about not gambling...I just don't have an interest. The documentary consists of Louis tagging along with several so- called 'high rollers'--people who consistently go to Vegas and spend a lot gambling. Some of them were very troubling--particularly the lady who claims to have lost $4,000,000 playing the slots (a game with the worst odds of all and which involves no skill). And, to try to see what it's like, Louis gambles a bit of his own money. Overall, this episode of Theroux's series is a bit light-weight compared to most. In other words, it doesn't seem to have a lot to say or isn't especially profound. Still, you get to see what the life of a high-roller is in Vegas--the sorts of comps they get, the money they spend and the attitudes that come along with them. Mildly interesting."],
