         "This is a case where the film's format and style do not quite match the complications of its narrative. It could either have been this immersive, intimate portrait of two people never quite getting on the same boat, all while having this roadtrip... but it was bogged down by messier elements. Sudhansu Saria made a decent debut though, and actors Dhruv Ganesh, Shiv Pandit and Siddharth Menon were fantastic and magnetic on screen. Sidenote: I am very devastated to learn about Dhruv",
         "I was fortunate to see this terrific film at an advanced screening in Los Angeles. I went in expecting a conventional love story. But as its title suggests, writer/director Suds Saria has crafted is an unconventional, moving film beautifully acted by the two terrific leads. I recommend putting it on your list of films to see.",
         "I recently watched Loev, and it was a very compelling experience. You get the feeling that you have watched something heartfelt, honest and complex. The film is visually stunning and has great performances by all the cast. It captures the subtle nuances of friendship, love & longing, while its realistic tone and quirky humor make the film very relatable. A must watch for everyone.",
         "This was a beautiful film about love, and the things that look like love but are a little different too. The cinematography is beautiful and the storytelling is rich and unique. The characters have an emotional depth rarely seen in romantic movies. I found myself simultaneously rooting for them and also hesitantly accepting their flaws. These characters are human in the sense that they are inconsistent and strong and weak and bold and meek like so many humans are. Can't wait to watch it again.",
         "I saw Loev at a film festival in San Francisco. I couldn't believe how entertained I was. It felt like a fresh take on a love story where the intimate details of a relationship slowly unfolded in front of you. It felt so real, raw, and tender. One of the things I liked most about Loev was the locations where it was filmed. I've never been to India, but it felt like a character in it's own right.",
         "As a gay man living in NYC (not Indian) - I was blown away by this beautiful and powerful film. While one might think this is a simple love/struggle story - it is not. I travel to India twice a year for work. I have been to the country 14 times. Indian culture views homosexuality a crime -- making this story even more powerful. It was also great to see some of the beautiful Indian country side. Do not miss this film.",
         "I was looking for this movie everywhere. Finally i got it on Netflix and man what a movie this is. This movie is totally honest to the plot and scenario and it never uses typical stereotypes and clichés regarding homosexuality which is the most refreshing thing about this movie. You really connect with the characters as this is like a piece of life. Throughout the entire movie you will sense both acceptance and denial of the situation which makes it more lifelike. You really sympathize with each of the characters. In the end when you come to know about Dhruv in real life, you are bound to get devastated and feel that ache in your heart. I have never given review to any film regarding homosexuality as i had never thought this kind of honest movie will ever be made. I can seriously watch this movie to the end of the time. Special thanks to the whole crew for this. Please watch this movie to understand how complex human emotions can be."
