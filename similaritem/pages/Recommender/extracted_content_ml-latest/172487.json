         "Well, the only reason why I'm commenting on this movie is because I've noticed prior comment from Philadelphia that blamed the movie for the chain of unconnected events - first, it's not quite true - those events were all connected by it was done artfully, not directly: like the one I remember well: a girl riding on the bus looks out of the window and exchanges looks with a handsome guy in the Mercedes, they look like they're created for each other or something close, it was very romantic scene even though it lasted a minute; then camera follows the car and a couple minutes later the car and all people in it pierced with hundred bullets coming from a group of killers, then camera follows killers, etc. I found it to be a very creative way of showing wide picture of life in modern Russia, different layers, different people, etc. BTW, the movie was nominated a couple of times and actually won some awards. Recommend to all open-minded people.",
         "Let us begin reviewing this film by asking a simple yet tricky question. What is the element which defines the identity of Russian culture and Russian nation ? The answer is fairly simple.Russian culture and Russian nation will always be recognized by the achievements of great Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin.This must be construed as a loud and clear messages to all those philistine souls who are foolish enough to believe that after the fall of Soviet empire the psyche of Russian nation is represented by non decrepit Lada cars and beautiful albeit dumb girls who try to seduce different men.This is the most important message of this film which is a visual feast for all those who like to watch films which stimulate their minds.In \"Day of the full Moon\",one event leads to another event as human beings are connected to each other through a mysterious emotional bond.What is common in all these events is the Russianness of every character.Music is in the form of songs sung by the same characters.Acting is perfect as there is a Russian Shirley Mcclaine too.By making \"Day of the full Moon\", Russian director Karen Shaknazarov has made a Slavic version of Robert Altman's famous American film \"Short Cuts\".He has ensured that all sections of Russian society are fairly represented.As there are many characters in the film,weak viewers might be tempted to label them as bizarre characters.It is precisely at this spot that viewers will err as these people are not oddball characters. They represent the heart and soul of modern day Russia. It would be a grave error to ignore them as they are crucial to this film's progress.This film was shown during 13th IFFK 2009 as part of a Karen Shaknazarov retrospective.Cinema-Poet website has an interview with Russian director Karen Shaknazarov when he spoke to film critic Lalit Rao about his films and the influence of music on them.",
         "Had I known anything about the movie, I'd probably agree to see it for free, but I wouldn't pay money. And that's just because I like to see Mosfilm's work. The film is a series of unconnected scenes, I imagine to show how all our lives are connected. But in the end, everyone in the theatre said to themselves, \"Is this the end?\" We were waiting for that final moment when everything would fall into place. It never came. Certain scenes in Kazakhstan (or somewhere in Central Asia) seem completely out of place for this film. They were best left out. Other filmgoers this day said they would have seen it just for the scenes of Russia. If you've seen Russia already then you can pass on this one.",
         "The movie format follows the same type of format as Slacker, where the movie jumps from one character to another, dwelling on each for a short period of time, showing some facet of life in Moscow. Also, just like Slacker, all the characters appear to be amateurs, and unfortunately quite often it is painfully apparent. Its pretty bad when a dog in the movie probably provides one of the best performances. Unlike Slacker, the dialogue is very spare, with many of the characters never even saying a word. The movie is pretty slow and meandering. I like slow movies, but sometimes even this movie tested my patience. I would agree with the commenter who said that the movie may be of some interest if you are not from Russia. Otherwise, probably not worth your time."
