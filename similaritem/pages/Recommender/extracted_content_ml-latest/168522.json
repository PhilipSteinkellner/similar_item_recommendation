Following them is a crazed Mandelsohn, determined to track down the boys and retrieve his stolen goods. On their journey they pick up an over aged rock singer, Morris (Weaving), who has a slight drinking problem. He rocks the boat with his romantic eyes cast over Mimi. If you are quick, you may be able to unravel the ending. If not, enjoy the company of a group of youths who don't have the answer to lives mystery besides surviving day by day and having a little fun along the way whilst reading romantic trash novels. Weaving, Taylor and Mendelsohn have fun with their characters and so do the viewer. And to everyone's surprise, Kimberley Davies plays the role of a blonde bimbo to perfection."],
