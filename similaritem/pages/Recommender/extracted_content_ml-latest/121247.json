This time, his victim is a beautiful, innocent and studious teenage girl named Diana Collins who accidentally opened up the Djinn's tomb (a strange box with a jewel inside) and released him. After gaining his freedom, the Djinn (disguised as an unlucky professor) goes into a murderous frenzy throughout her college campus, in an effort to find Diana and force her to fulfill her three wishes. While Diana is on the run, she must endeavor to prevent the Djinn from subjecting the entire world to Hell's wrath. Diana uses one of her wishes (the second one) to summon the archangel Michael who possesses the body of her boyfriend, Greg, but even he cannot kill the Djinn as only the one who awakened him can do it with Michael's sword which Diana cannot yet wield. In the end, Diana's attempt to sacrifice herself (attempts to jump off a building) gives her the ability to wield Michael's sword and she kills the Djinn with it, but is fatally injured when they both fall in the process. Michael heals her wounds before returning to Heaven, and Diana is finally able to admit she loves her boyfriend, who has returned to normal, though injured.",

         "I'm going to be frank. When I first saw Wishmaster back in 1997, I was greatly impressed. Here was a brave little film that: a) Stayed away from the teen horror genre (hiring hip teens to be butchered left and right) and hired unknowns. b) Was an homage to the splatterfests that haunted the screens from the late 70s to the early 90s (including the Freddy, Jason, and Pinhead films) c) Had some interesting cameos by some of the biggest horror stars, including Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger), Kane Hodder (Jason Voorhees), and Tony Todd (Candyman). All you needed was Doug Bradley (Pinhead) and Gunnar Hansen (Leatherface) and you would have a full house! d) Introduced us to a frightening screen villain that joined the ranks of the classics: the Djinn. What made the Djinn so eerie was his cruel wish-making and, of course, the voice and presence of Andrew Divoff. When I first heard that they made Wishmaster 3 and Wishmaster 4 together and with a new actor as the Djinn, I was a bit disappointed. How could they replace the best actor to play the Djinn? It's like replacing Doug Bradley and Robert Englund and having Pinhead and Freddy played by Ewan McGregor and Seann William Scott. And when I finally saw Wishmaster 3, my worst fear had come true. I thought that Wishmaster 2 was pretty bad enough, especially with the Djinn design change, but when I saw this one, I was so insulted by it, I started thinking that Wishmaster 2 was a masterpiece. I had a few main problems with the film. A) The lame wishes. If the wish was grotesque, it was ridiculous. The exploding heart, grotesque. The professor being ravaged by the demon women, ridiculous. B) The acting. The actors are talented people, but they acted like they didn't even WANT to be in the movie. A.J. Cook (talented, but bad material), Tobias Mehler (good actor, bad projects (especially that Godforsaken Carrie remake!!!), and Jason Connery (who doesn't seem to have as great an acting capability as his father) just never seem to be believable. C) The Djinn himself. With Andrew Divoff, even in the most ridiculous scenes imaginable, he always found a way to make the Djinn dark and scary. With John Novak filling his shoes, he's degenerated the Djinn into a second-class jokester (think of Freddy in the later sequels). D) St. Michael being the Djinn's nemesis? Does this even need to be talked about? If you want to rent a good horror film, rent either Jeepers Creepers, the original Wishmaster, or Jason X (not 100% horror, but it's much more entertaining), or go to the theaters and see The Ring, Final Destination 2, or Darkness Falls. Just avoid Wishmaster 3: The Sword of Justice (or Beyond the Gates of Hell, whetever the Hell they decide to call it this week) like the plague!",
         "what this movie needs is a good screenplay, but no they stuck with this piece of crap. on a review i did before on the movie ripper(good=7/10), i said a movie needed to be bloody, gory and fun, they got the blood and gore they just need fun, and that ruined the whole movie, and it's sad because i'm a fan of a.j. cook and horror movies, this just didn't work, sorry a.j. but i must tell the people to skip it. Bad=4/10 (sorry a.j.)",
         "For the third time, the evil Wishmaster return with more evil and grotesque to wreck the life of more innocents. This time, his victim is a beautiful, innocent and studious teenage girl named Diana Collins who accidentally opened up the Djinn from his tomb and released him. After the freedom, the Djinn went into a murderous frenzy though her college campus and he is trying to find Diana to fulfill her three wishes. Whilst Diana is in the run, she must endeavor to prevent the Djinn and complete the heavy task to free the entire world from Hell's wrath. Really, really lame. Wishmaster was a pretty decent horror film, but part two was garbage and this...Well, words fail me. The acting is atrocious! John Novak is terrible as the Djinn! How he's starred in so many films I don't know. The gore is plentiful but unconvincing (Done by SOTA effects, there kind of like a poor man's KNB FX. They also did the effects for 'Amityville: Dollhouse')and the Wishmaster himself is looking as fake as ever. A very bad, unwatchable film. Proof that you don't have to go to film school in order to make movies. 1/10.",
         "Now after seeing the first 2 'Wishmaster' movies, I had high expectations for this movie. Apparently, they were too high...what hurts this movie, is that it's a total 360 turn from the first 2 movies. What this movie tries to be is a 'Scream' & a \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" movie...which isn't saying too much, since they were mere silly movies, than horror movies. Too many just average actors & no pazzazz to it. Jason Connery as the human form of the Djinn isn't convincing. Andrew Divoff, who played the first Djinn character, was great. Such evilness to him. If you're a fan of the first movies, go see it, but don't expect a horror movie.",
         "This installment just didn't do it for me. The wonderfully rich, well-researched story line has gone to h3ll in a hand basket. The acting quality is not up to par and I find the whole production to be quite disappointing as a whole. It rips off Hellraiser with the \"puzzle box\" and a plethora of other movies. I really found the Djinn's constant metamorphosis to be unsettling and just wrong. He looks different in each and every installment. That's messed up. And the fake accents throughout this production are BAD; obviously fake, and they don't seem to care. Sex is used as a sorry substitution for a good story (something used as a distraction device by lesser directors and those lacking in talent and creativity) and the effects were better in \"Howard the Duck,\" than in this. The invocation of the Archangel Michael renders this one a rip off of the movie Michael, as well, which done around the same time, and the flaming sword is really idiotic. I was very disappointed in this installment. I enjoyed the first, but as usual, the third movie in the set just reeks of bad acting, horrid direction and a total change in cast members. Apparently they thought that by keeping the Djinn mainly in his Djinn form, we would not notice the disappearance of Michael Divoff. You can sure tell that Wes Craven did not produce more than the first of these awful movies. That, and the obvious mainstream socioreligious connotations just ruined this whole series for me. Actually, Howard the Duck was a much better movie! It gets a 1.0/10 from... the Fiend :.",
         "This was the first Wishmaster film I watched on TV and I liked it, it actually got me into the Wishmaster films. I like Andrew Divoff's performance as the Djinn because he gives him a real creepiness while John Novak gives the Djinn a Freddy type character but I still like it. The only disappointment was that we don't see the Djinn as much as the previous films but it still doesn't make a really bad film. Jason Connery tries hard to live up to the Djinn's performance when his in human form. Wishmaster 4 is slightly better than Wishmaster 3 but check this one out if you're looking for something to watch on a night.",
         "*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT* I saw this the other day with a friend of mine. He HATED it. Despised it. There was just something about the Wishmaster that rubbed him the wrong way. I think he may have been too goofy for him. The ending was pretty weak too. I didn't think \"Wishmaster 3\" was that bad. But I was shouted down with \"WOW! That movie sucked! I wish it away!\" I had to protect the movie before it was thrown against the wall. The Wishmaster is released from his prison and goes about being all the demon he can be. He prowls around a college campus looking for the girl who let him out. If he can grant her wishes, the world will be destroyed. Of course it will. The Wishmaster doesn't play fair with his wishes. No matter what you wish for, you will pay dearly. Even the most innocuous wish will result in an extremely painful death. You can wish for a cute puppy and a little dog will spring out of nowhere and lunge for your throat. But he's so cute! Even if the Wishmaster doesn't ask for a wish and you're just standing around mumbling to yourself, \"I wish I had some more money\", a gold bar will land on your skull. Didn't see that coming did ya?! Maybe the movie is trying to say we should stop wishing our lives away. We daydream of a better life and the Wishmaster gives us a fatal reality check. I kind of liked the Wishmaster and his unfair Death Wishes. It worked for me.",
         "First of all,Wishmaster 1 and 2 were great movies,but Wishmaster 3 sucks ass!The one thing I didnt like about this movie,was that they ruined the whole concept of the Djinn,his make-up looks like it was from a low budget horror movie that came from the sixties or something.Another thing that they messed up on,was the Djinn's voice,it doesnt sound original anymore,it just sounds like a classic devil voice.When you look back to Wishmaster 1,you'll see that the plot is original,and that it was a masterpiece,but in part 3,the story is cheap and corny.In the first movie,the main character was smart,she used the three wishes to destroy the Djinn,in this one,they have to impale him with a sword from heaven in order to kill him,but really,that doesnt work at all!!The acting was very very crappy,none of the actors give any felling to the movie whatsoever.It seems like the director wanted to spice up the movie by adding lots of blood and gore,but really,all the gore effects look really bad,the scene where the Djinn slices off the professer's face,looks very crappy.I should also mention that the special effects was a joke.I'm serious about this,the movie made me depressed for a short period of time.I hate this movie with all my heart. I wish that every single copy of Wishmaster 3 would just banish into a crap filled sewer.I give this movie a 0 out of 10,I hate it that much.",
         "CAUTION: SPOILERS!!!!!!!! This movie is about 12 steps down from the first one. First of all, I don't care what anyone says, the actor who plays the Djinn in this one, John Novak is totally NOT intimidating at all!!!!! In the behind the scenes extras on Wishmaster 1, Director Robert Kurtzman specifically says that he wanted to stay away from a story that revolved around teenagers and 20 somethings who were merely cannon fodder for the Djinn to go through like Kleenex. So as you can imagine, I was saddened to see that the setting is on a college campus, and that the story revolves around young 20 somethings. They basically did the complete opposite of what made the first movie so awesome!! Plus, the Djinn barely appears in his true form at all through this sleeping pill of a film. The story also takes an unexpected, yet unfortunate turn when the waker, A.J.(Diana Collins), wishes for the spirit of the archangel Michael (no I'm not making this up) to come and help her defeat the Djinn. MY GOD, I wish they had never made this movie!!!!!!!!!",
         "I haven't seen the first couple WISHMASTERS -- apparently they play rather close to the traditional notion of the \"supernatural wish that takes an unexpected turn\" kind of thing. It's essentially a morality tale. Here, though, the wishes are pretty pro-forma, as are the nasty twists: just an excuse to show a lot of gore. Not a bad amount of gore, at that: the director makes wise use of his budget. The plot is obvious, the solution to the problem pretty easy to spot early on. The characters are all annoying crybabies, especially the men. There's too many fake scares. The Wishmaster ill-advisedly becomes Sean Connery's son sometime during the proceedings, generally not a good idea as Jason Connery looks like a prematurely balding college professor, not a Demon From Hell. There's some nudity, though, which is good. Generally not worth paying much for, but if you find it for a couple of dollars, the way I did, you might be amused by it."
