When Dustin mows the lawn of seventy-five year old Jonathan Sperry (Gavin MacLeod), a man he has seen at church, a unique friendship develops. What happens the rest of the summer is something Dustin and his friends will never forget.",

         "I went to see this film today out of curiosity. I figured that I was going to have a good laugh at it when I read that Gavin MacLeod was the star of it. I didn't think I could take him seriously in a role like this because I always think of him as Captain Stubing on The Love Boat. MacLeod became a born again Christian in real life and making this film was a real labor of love for him. I came to scorn and left to rejoice. I had a very pleasant surprise because this is a beautiful film. Its so sad that it wont even be a footnote in the 2009 box office history. People who are not as brilliant as I am will make fun of it and miss its very important message. It has only limited release and when I went to see it, I was the ONLY one in the whole theatre. It is a real pleasure seeing a film like this because Hollywood has long had a jaded attitude about religion. In other words, whenever they make a film about it they always show the religious person as crazy, corrupt or both. Thinking back over the years, I can only name The Passion Of The Christ as a film that showed religion in a favorable way. People may condemn this film for being preachy, but I loved it. It had such a powerful message and Gavin MacLeod gave an awesome performance. He brought Jonathan Sperry to life and you loved this wonderful old man who had such love in his heart. I can think of no other actor who could have done such a brilliant job and I say give Gavin MacLeod the Oscar! Sadly this will never happen. I also wanted to praise the young actors in the film, they all did a great job even the one playing Nick the bully. I loved the part where Jonathan reached Nick and made him realize the cause of his meaness. I wanted to particularly praise a young actor named Jansen Panettine who played Justin the lead kid. He is a real acting prodigy and I predict a great future for this young man! I kept wondering when he was going to work up the nerve to ask that girl for a date and I was angry at that other waitress for throwing his note away. Watching the three boys and the typical kid problems they went thru sort of reminded me of Stand By Me. I just loved everything about this film from the way they faithfully created the \"look\" of the seventies (when people only tipped fifty cents!) to the beautiful musical score, the powerful message and the awesome work of everyone involved. If I had my way, this film would have gotten top billing everywhere. SPOILER ALERT, I knew that Mister Sperry would die in the end of the film and Jansen Panettine did a great job showing the grief this boy feels over his beloved friends death. I know that people may mock me for saying this but I feel I am a better person for seeing this film.",
         "Here you're going to read a lot of unfair commentary on this film that is largely based on hatred of basic Christian values. That's come to be expected and that point is even made in the film. If you want to be entertained by a family friendly comedy about a kid who learns a valuable life lesson(in an unexpected way) without having to worry about the obligatory negatives of the average theatrical release then you won't be disappointed. I think you'll find as I did a great story and surprisingly professional grade acting among the young cast members and outstanding performances among the senior members. I was surprised by the quality of this film and I expect you will be too.",
         "I saw a pre-release version about two months ago. As a fan of movies with car chases, explosions, and superhuman exploits, I did not expect to really get into this movie. The story deals with the relationships between characters in a small town in 1970 and feels like a coming-of-age movie as a young man and his friends deal with a childhood crush on a young lady. The boy-meets-girl subplot is a slight of hand before the real plot unfolds. And the resolution of one of the other subplots is the final coup de grace of the film. I found the film moving and well worth watching...again. The film opens today in limited release. My family and I are going to see it.",
         "I decided to give this movie a try and went in with an open mind. I usually love to watch scary movies, but some friends who I was with at the time aren't into scary movies and we went in to see Jonathan Sperry. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised and really touched by this film. Gavin MacLeod did a wonderful job as well as the three boys who played friends in the movie, but I have to say one particular guy stood out in this movie for me. Taylor Boggan, the guy who played Nick the bully, did an amazing job. The emotions he displayed, especially the scene when he was in the bedroom crying to God to help him, brought out emotions in me I never knew I had. He made you feel the pain that his character was feeling, it was such a powerful scene for him to have pulled off beautifully. I know we will be seeing more of this kid, and he is going to be recognized very soon as the strong talented actor he is, he has a great future going for him. This film whether you are religious or not, tugs at your heart, it makes you want to be a better person. It's a shame because I think a lot of people won't give this film a try because they will think of it as just some religious movie, but it is so much more than that. It is really a coming of age story about three boys, who are tormented by a bully, who is in so much pain emotionally that he takes it out on those around him. And in enters Jonathan Sperry, the one man who sees through his pain and helps him overcome it. He brings these boys together, through his love, patience and teachings, and in the end they are all a lot stronger and more forgiving of one another. This movie has everything, laughter, tears and excitement. I really am glad I decided to give this movie a try, it is well worth it!!!",
         "This movie is amazing. In many ways today it is more scary than the saw movie series and I for one cannot believe it was even made. It is a wholesome movie that sometimes focuses on people being nice to each other. It should sometimes surprise us that a wholesome movie with some religious content makes us more uncomfortable at least in the movie beginnings than the slasher movies or saw movies or the like. We have been programmed I believe to think that movies like this are square or out of date, or just not cool or with it. So there is a tendency to want to hide your face at the start of the movie and slink to the door hoping no one will see you. But if you brave it out, and yes, you can even hold hands in the scary parts, you might find something unique. You might find the movie touching, and you might even want to cry a little, yes, even if you are a male. And at the end you might ask, why is it again that we are so afraid to be nice to other humans or watch movies that show that? Maybe if we give it a chance, and this movie a chance, being nice to each other might just catch on.",
         "Our family watched The Secrets of Jonathan Sperry last night and each one of us thought it was an absolutely wonderful movie. We have had this film in our Netflix Watch Instantly queue ever since Netflix acquired it, but had never taken time to watch it. When we decided to watch it as a family last night, my 11-year-old son balked and said it looked like it would be \"boring\", but even he was brought to unexpected tears and smiles here and there throughout (as were the rest of us); and at the end he was the first to say what a great movie this was and that \"we really need to buy this\". The main theme that stood out to me in this film was the impact that one person could have on so many other people's lives, especially if they truly live what they profess to believe. I highly recommend this heart-felt, family-friendly, thought-provoking film.",
         "This is the Christiano brothers' best film (thus far), a lovely coming-of-age story about several youths in a sleepy upstate New York town circa 1970. In some ways it seems like the '50s, and the boys' shorts are definitely post-1985 length, but these are minor quibbles. Gavin MacLeod solidly portrays the title character, perhaps the meatiest role of his entire career, and quite likely an accurate reflection of his offscreen personality. I saw this in the theatre, and the Gospel message is completely at odds with what the other films were selling/saying. It was a sad reminder of what this nation has fallen from. For what could have been a pedantic, by-the-numbers evangelistic tract on film, this is instead a moving, well-crafted, tightly scripted bit of cinema. If this is any indication, we can expect even better things from the Christiano brothers in the years ahead.",
         "A bit sweet but filling. This is a faith based film that is set in 1970. As a child of 14 growing up in a small town in 1970 I found the scenes, clothing and language authentic to the period and that was what was most entertaining to me. The story was simplistic, and uncomplicated but entertaining. As a child growing up in that era and being part of a church going family much of it was familiar. The polite talk and genteel and caring way people dealt with each other was reminiscent of my childhood and a great escape from the crude, crass and lurid entertainment in vogue today. I do wish it had a more dynamic story. Mr Sperry reminds me of two men in my life who were very much like him in the way he went out of his way to bring young boys to Christ. Although I fell from the path many times in my life their memories always urge me to get back on it. As a former soldier, biker club president and self employed businessman my life and faith walk is much more complicated with many more challenges but the simplicity of this story reminds me of a simpler time and re-enforces my resolve to be the man I aspire to be. Although I have seen much of the seedier and cruder part of life in my day the two men who made that investment in me as a boy have kept me in Christ's fold.",
         "Heart-warming and funny. A golden nugget and light-spirited. Great message to grasp and lesson to be learned. Definitely one to add to my collection. Not your usual movie about bullies, and the secrets of an aged man. This movie is filled with lessons, teachings, messages and warnings. However, there is one overall hidden positive message/lesson that I wonder if anyone has or will notice, between \"Dustin\" and \"Tanya\". I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it. Actually thought about using it for a bible study or my own personal teaching for myself. I know I could get a lot more out of this movie than what I have already watching it 5x so far. Unfortunately anything without explicit scenes or tainted by the world's cynical view of everything is very rare in this day in age. Acting is mediocre, but if that's all one gets out of this movie, than sorry but you really wasted your own time with this one.",
         "This movie was very well done indeed. Inspiring, convincing, well acted and great for all ages. The film and sound quality are A+ I wish more movies of this genre were made using the high standards used for this film. I was delighted to see Gavin MacLeod(from the Love Boat) and Robert Guillaume. I grew up in the 70's and this movie brought back some of my fondest memories as I'm sure it will for so many others. There is one very emotional scene that parents of children under 8 should be present for but other than that, this movie has the potential to inspire anyone from 8 to 120. Movie tip: forget the popcorn; bring tissue, lots of it."
