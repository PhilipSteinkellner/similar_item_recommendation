For me this is the third version from the last three consecutive years. After the original French film based on the same name of the book, followed by the Kollywood remake 'Thoongavanam'. The second film was not bad, considering the way it was made to the Indian standards. They did not change much, but in this one the initial parts were almost the same and the following developments were too much. I mean literally they turned it into twice thriller with tight action sequences. Their main idea was to leave the open conclusion for a possible sequel. Which was really too intentional that not everybody would be happy with, for like those who liked the previous versions.\r\n\r\nThe actors were good, but Michelle Monaghan was the best among. Unlike the same characters from other versions, I don't know how they turned Monaghan's role so powerful. That's the negative, as the film Jamie Foxx in the lead. Otherwise, as a neutral, this is not a bad remake. The Immigrant joke was trimmed off, since today's US is not in favour of such comedies in films. And many events, especially film scenes were accelerated. So the camera moves one place to another in a quick succession unlike other versions. Yeah, these changes were needed, since the film was not a fresh piece of work or even first remake. But like I said too muchness spoiled the party. Even though one time watchable film.\r\n\r\n_6/10_",

      "synopsis": "Two men in masks are chasing after a van. They hit the van and cause it to crash. The men are really cops - Vincent Downs (Jamie Foxx) and Sean Cass (T.I.). They fight the men in the van and kill one as more thugs show up with guns. Vincent and Sean shoot the men and steal a duffel bag with 25 kilograms of cocaine in it. Vincent is an Internal Affairs officer who has been conducting a two-year investigation into a crime ring. He knows Sean is a courier for the ring, but his top targets are casino owner Stanley Rubino (Dermot Mulroney), and the boss behind everything, Rob Novak (Scoot McNairy). Detective Jennifer Bryant (Michelle Monaghan) walks into her department with a cut on her face. She speaks to a police psychologist about a recent incident in which she attempted to take down a meth lab but was assaulted by a junkie. Now many of her colleagues think she is in over her head and should take time off, but she is determined to get in on the drug ring case. Vincent and Sean are sent back to the scene of their crime. They pick up some evidence as Vincent and Jennifer meet for the first time. There is obvious tension between them as they both feel the need to take control of the case. Vincent goes to the hospital to pick up his son Thomas (Octavius J. Johnson) for sports practice. Vincent finds out that his ex-wife Dena (Gabrielle Union) is engaged to another man. Both Dena and Thomas know Vincent has been distant since he took on the case, but they were never made aware of the case itself. Vincent is driving Thomas away when the two are ambushed on the parkway. Two men attack them, resulting in Thomas being snatched and Vincent getting stabbed in the abdomen. Almost immediately, Vincent receives a call from Rubino. He knows Vincent took the coke and demands that he bring it to the Luxus casino that he owns within three hours, or Novak will retaliate against Vincent and his family. Sean finds Vincent tending to his wound. Vincent blows up on Sean and orders him to bring him the bag of coke before they are all in trouble. Novak tortures his cousin, who is a DEA informant and one of the men that Vincent and Sean hit when they stole the coke. He has the man hung upside down with balls shot at him before Novak orders his goons to cut out his cousin's tongue. Vincent brings the coke in a trash bag to the Luxus and puts it up in the ceiling over a stall in the men's bathroom. He goes upstairs to meet with Rubino to negotiate for Thomas's return. However, Jennifer arrives at the casino with her partner Doug Dennison (David Harbour). She goes knocking through the stalls when the bathroom attendant tells her that Vincent was going around there as well. Jennifer finds the bag and takes it to the women's locker room in the spa. When it is discovered that the drugs are missing, Vincent tries to go find them himself. Meanwhile, Novak arrives at the casino and begins pressing Rubino for the coke or else Novak's father (who operates an even bigger crime circle) will have something to say about it. Vincent brings Rubino a bag of sugar to fool them as they hand Thomas over to Vincent. They start making their way out of the casino when Novak learns that he was given sugar. One of Rubino's large thugs chases after Vincent and Thomas as they go down by the kitchen. Vincent's stab wound starts seeping, and he admits to his son that he is part of a large drug case. The thug then finds the two and starts fighting Vincent in the kitchen. Thomas attempts to intervene to help his father. Vincent subdues the thug by throwing him through a window into an office. Vincent and Thomas try escaping through the club, but the thug re-captures Thomas. Dena continues to call Vincent as he tries to hide the fact that Thomas was taken from him while he continues to try and rescue him, though he does let her know he is at the Luxus. Vincent poses as a hotel employee in order to get by unnoticed. He runs into Jennifer, who identifies him and goes after him. They have a fight in one of the rooms before Vincent cuffs Jennifer to the bed. He explains his involvement in the case and reveals he is IA, having been undercover for two years and having to keep it from his family. Vincent goes to the locker room to find the bag, but it's gone from the locker. He is found by Dennison and starts a fight with him. Vincent knocks him out in the hot tub but pulls him out so he won't drown. Thomas manages to get away since the bad guys left the door open. He takes Rubino's phone and contacts Vincent to let him know where he is. At the same time, Dena becomes aware that something bad is going on, so she leaves the hospital and rushes to the casino. The thugs find Vincent and Thomas in the club once again. The big thug from earlier fights Vincent again as Novak starts shooting up the place. Vincent breaks off a champagne bottle and sticks the broken end in the thug's neck before getting himself and Thomas out of there. In the parking garage, Vincent encounters Sean, who has learned that Vincent is IA. Another thug approaches them with a gun, leading to himself and Sean shooting each other. Vincent tries to wake Sean up, but he appears dead. Vincent looks at Rubino's phone and sees a message from Dennison. He's on Novak's payroll and has informed his bosses that the drugs are missing and that Vincent could place them. Jennifer and Dennison find the thug and Sean in the parking garage. Dennison goes to Sean, who is still alive. When Dennison asks Sean if Vincent knows of Dennison's involvement, Sean just tells him to go fuck himself. Dennison suffocates Sean to death while still lying to Jennifer. Vincent and Thomas try to get out of the casino as the bad guys chase after them. Rubino tries to get away, but he is arrested by Jennifer, Dennison, and a group of other officers. Vincent and Thomas take a sports car from the lobby and drive into the garage as Novak straps up and puts on a mask. In the garage, Novak starts shooting tear gas canisters all around the place as Vincent and Thomas try to get away. More thugs come in, just as Dena shows up with her own gun. The thugs get killed before Novak has Vincent and his family cornered. Vincent steps out and tries to negotiate with Novak, but Novak shoots Vincent in the chest. Vincent falls to the ground and shoots Novak in the neck and heart, killing him. Vincent manages to call Jennifer's phone and play back Dennison's voicemail so she can hear. Now that she knows the truth, she attempts to shoot Dennison, but he grabs her gun and shoots her first. He then kills Rubino and the driver, causing the car to flip over and crash. The other officers arrive and get Dennison out. He claims that Rubino went crazy and that he killed Jennifer, but she crawls out of the car and tells the other officers to arrest Dennison. Vincent and Jennifer are both taken to the hospital. Both of them eventually wake up, with Dena and Thomas sitting by Vincent's bed. Jennifer goes to Vincent's room. He tells her she's a great cop. The CSI team is sweeping up the garage where Novak and his thugs lie dead. Novak's phone rings, and it's his dad calling. A DEA agent on their payroll answers the phone and tells Novak's dad that there's been a problem.",

         "Jamie Fox and Michelle Monaghan, what were they doing in this? Both are way too good to be in a movie this bad. Hollywood continuing to churn out junk like this and showing their disrespect for the viewing audience by thinking people are going to continue to pay and swallow this stuff. Well maybe some are but my standards are a lot higher than this. Jamie gets stabbed in the beginning of the movie and then walks around through the rest of the movie like he can barely stand up and walk, but yet has all these fight scenes after that where he is beating up everybody with no hint of an injury. Then after each fight is over, he appears again all injured like he is going to pass out, that is until the next fight scene comes up. Jeez. I guess Hollywood is saying, \"don't stab thus dude, cause it makes him fight better. Then the bad guy is shooting a machine gun in the parking garage with a gas mask on shooting tear gas all over the place yet nobody walking through it is coughing a bit. Heh heh. I guess Hollywood thinks everybody are idiots and are not going to notice. This movie was not a good one.",
         "Jamie Foxx is always good value, especially when he's wounded. Although the only difference between his wounded and non-wounded state is that he stops every now and again, groans, feels his wound then takes off again as if nothing had happened. I will refrain from making any jokes about the title - I'm sure there are plenty in the reviews here already - just to say that it bears no relevance to the movie at all. Anyway, back to the movie. The direction, etc is just fine with a few set pieces, but the story is derivative, predictable and by the numbers. You'll even guess who the 'baddie' is long before the end. As cop/action flicks go, it's not bad, but the point is, do you really want to spend your life watching so-so movies. There was absolutely no point in making this movie or telling this story, Jamie Foxx fans notwithstanding. So if you're happy with low-bar movies, go watch it, but maybe you want to raise your expectations and, hope beyond hope, perhaps filmmaker will raise their game. But don't hold your breath.",
         "6 Apr 2017 in an small room with even smaller number of people I start watching this movie that I \"vouched\" for my girlfriend because I quote \" Jamie Foxx plays in good movies.\" Half-way through the movie I already asked her more than 3 times if she want's to go home and watch Star Wars ep-2 (we started watching it because she never saw it). Few people already left the cinema and we only stayed because we payed. Every main or supporting actor is angry for no good reason. The soundtrack is angry. Most scenes are predictable and all intentions are extremely easy to reveal. I thing is for sure. Jamie Foxx can also play in bad movies.",
         "Ecclesiastes 1:9 came up with the oft used quote that \"there is nothing new under the sun\". \"Sleepless\" proves that in spades. Bent copper drama? Check. Dodgy casino owner? Check. Nasty \"Black Rain\" style hoodlum? Check. Kidnapped teen (\"I WILL find you\")? Check. Misunderstood family man? Check. All of these standard tropes are lobbed into the movie blender and pulsed well. Holding it all together are solid performances from Jamie Foxx (\"Django Unchained\") as Vincent Downs, the cop with a dodgy background, and Michelle Monaghan (\"Source Code\", \"Patriot's Day\") as the internal affairs cop doggedly on his trail. In terms of the storyline it's best to go into the film (as I did) with limited knowledge of the plot (on which more below). As the film opens, and playing out a strong anti-hero role, Downs with his equally dodgy partner are involved in a shootout at a drug deal in the streets of Las Vegas. This allows them to get their hands on a significant quantity of heroine. Naturally they pocket this, but unbeknownst to them the deal was between casino boss Rubino (Dermot Mulrooney, \"The Grey\") and the vicious mafia son of the local Novak family, Rob (Scoot McNairy, \"Argo\"). For Downs the pressure is on when his teenage son Thomas ( Octavius J. Johnson) is kidnapped as a trade for the drugs. The film delivers some good fight scenes and action, but nothing we haven't seen before in countless other movies like Bourne. What drags the film down though through is the scripting and direction. There are such a range of implausibilities on show here that it makes you wonder why anyone involved in the film didn't just stop and say \"WAIT A MINUTE HERE GUYS\" and demand a rewrite. For example, Foxx suffers a severe knife wound early in the film, but repeatedly bounces from 'full action hero fighting machine' mode to 'staggering and holding his side' mode without pause. The wound adds nothing but implausibility to the action, so why include it at all?? And a scene in an underground car park involving copious quantities of tear gas brought tears of embarrassment to my eyes: an affliction that didn't seem to affect any of the protagonists in the film! This is a great shame, and writer Andrea Berloff (\"Straight Outta Compton\") and Swiss-born director Baran bo Odar should have more respect for their audience's intelligence (that's the third movie in recent weeks I've made that comment on... it must be the time of year!). It's also extremely irritating that one of the key twists in the movie (although you may guess it) is so blatantly spoiled: both by an audio line in the trailer (at 1:40) and \u2013 more appallingly \u2013 by one of the two straplines for the film on the posters. Thankfully I never noticed this before I saw the film. Fox and Monaghan are too good for the material but have screen chemistry that keeps the film watchable. I also thought Scoot McNairy was great as the cold-eyed crazy hoodlum and it's also interesting to see Dermot Mulrooney, so memorable as the male lead in 1997's \"My Best Friend's Wedding\", back in a mainstream role. By the way, I have no idea why the film is called \"Sleepless\", other than it being based on a 2011 French film called \"Nuit Blanche\" which was perhaps written in a way where it made more sense. Vincent is no Jack Bauer and he gets more than a small opportunity to catnap during the running time! In summary, the movie is perfectly watchable for its action moments. In fact, as I *think* my wife, who is a great fan of \"Die Hard, \"Taken\", et al would like it I've added a star to my initial rating. And it's done with some style such that it has the *potential* to be a good film \u2013 \u2013 which is frustrating. But in my view it's not worth the ticket price at the cinema: wait instead for it to arrive on Amazon/Netflix. The end of the film suggests a set-up for a sequel. I doubt this is a sequel that will ever get made. (For the graphical version of this review, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com. Thanks).",
         "Let me start by saying that I like gritty neo-noir thrillers, Jamie Foxx and dramas that are set in a compressed time frame. The trailer to \"Sleepless\" promised all of this and I was sold. I didn't expect anything outstanding, but something a little bit like Mann's \"Miami Vice\" or \"Collateral\". The digital cinematography by the talented Mihai Malaimare Jr. (\"The Master\", \"A Walk Among The Tombstones\", \"Tetro\") is better than this kind of movie deserves and creates a moody, but still realistic Las Vegas setting using grey, black, blue, green and purple color tones. No color is there only by coincidence. The frame is always beautifully composed. Some of the action footage looks spectacular. So, why doesn't it work? The screenplay by the Oscar-nominated Andrea Berloff is very conventional and full of cliché, but so are other good B-pictures with a less stellar cast. It's surprisingly flat and without any originality at all. You've seen every twist before in better movies. But it's not as bad, that it needs a Razzie nomination. It might have worked if directed by some talented guy, but... The direction is a mess. It's not only weak directing, but incompetent directing, because Baran bo Odar makes mistakes you usually only see in student films, where the filmmakers don't really care about realism too much. Some of the actions of the characters don't make any sense and are staged in an unbelievable manner. My favorite example is the moment when one of the bad guys aims with his gun at Jamie Foxx. He could easily kill him now, but what does he do? He walks a few steps back. Then suddenly Foxx' son in the movie drives into him with his car, without making any noise first, so the bad guy is surprised by his death. Another big thing that bothered me was the son: Why didn't he leave the building after his unrealistic-escape-by-coincidence ? No, he prefers to stay in the disco. Really? These things would not happen in real-life, only in movies, where the director is not able to block and stage a scene in a believable manner. Or he simply doesn't care for realism or logical actions by motivated characters. The whole showdown is ridiculous and unintentionally funny because of the bad direction and the mediocre writing. Maybe good editing could have fixed some errors and save the movie from its ridiculousness, but even then it would still be only an uninspired B-picture. What we have here is proof of disregard for the audience and intelligent storytelling. Maybe Baran bo Odar once showed some promise at the beginning of his career, but based on \"Sleepless\" I would never hire this guy for anything except maybe a car commercial. I only give it 4/10 because of stylish cinematography. A waste of talent.",
         "Sleepless was originally released in January this year in America but only hit UK cinemas on 5th May and is a sort of remake of the French film 'Sleepless Night'. I saw the trailer and it looked like a cool throwback action thriller. Normally January movies are notorious for being low-budget or not very good which is why studios put them out at the start of the year when none of the of the blockbuster films are released etc. So with its initial release 'Sleepless' was lumped in with all of those films and was panned by the critics for being generic, bad editing, boring etc. I saw it yesterday (6th May) and had low expectations due to all the negativity, however I don't know what film the critics were watching, to me it did what it was meant to do 95 mins car chases and fight scenes and not to be taken seriously. The film follows Vincent Downes as an undercover cop trying to workout who is a rat within the DEA, who intervenes in a drug trade between two gangs and takes the drugs. However after that one of the gangs kidnaps his son and demands Vincent to return the drugs, however DEA Agent Bryant is also looking for the gang's drug trafficking for her own personal and professional reasons. What I really like is the time frame of this movie, Downes is given just 3 hours to get the drugs back so it allows the movie to move at a fast pace. Also its good seeing a 15 age rated movie that doesn't pull any punches with the fight scenes (which is what seems to be happening with more of these films e.g. Taken) they are brutal and well choreographed, gun shot wounds splatter blood and stab wounds look very painful. Jamie Foxx acts well in this, he plays the serious/sarcastic cop well and delivers his lines convincingly, Michelle Monaghan is good as Agent Bryant and the two villains are well acted, Rubino (Dermot Mulroney) is more of a traditional gangster style business man, however the standout performance is by Scoot McNairy who plays the psychotic drug lord Novak. It's cool to see an action thriller which is just dumb fun with cool fight scenes. Ignore the negative reviews and give this a watch.",
         "Based on the coming attractions, I wasn't expecting much, and I got even less. This is another good cop/bad cop, is he or isn't he, kind of flick, set in Las Vegas with lots of glitz and glamour to hide what is a very shaky plot. If the glitz and glamour aren't enough to dazzle you, the music tracks will deafen you, and your visual delights will be satisfied with death by knife, death by pistol, death by automatic weapon, death by shotgun, death by truck, death by wine bottle - just to name a few. The acting is pretty good, all things considered, but the direction is appalling and the action-every-minute film has low spots. Generally I like films about internal affairs. \"Internal Affairs\" (1990), \"The Departed\" (2006) and \"Q&A\" (1990) are my favorites.",
         "This is I what I call \"a comedy of errors\" Ridiculous, hilarious effort from Hollywood on a remake of \"Nuit Blanche\" (Sleepless Night), (2011). The original was truthful to its name. but this? if it hasn't been so loud I would have caught a nap. What can I say? predictable, terrible directing acting, editing, and so on and so forth. Repetitive but definitely not boring, because it is more of comedy than an action thriller,... what? anyone here was acting, my bad I thought they were joking! \"Saddest part\"Jamie Foxx will never catch up with Denzel Washington!",
         "Jamie Foxx can't really save this movie though he's probably the bright spot here no doubt. Foxx gets to play a heavy cop fairly straight to which he's up to that. He's better though when his penchant for humor is front and center. It's the overall same old drug/cop story and way too over-the-top constant cat and mouse action that brings things down. Not much meat and lots of filler. This is a confusing ride about a corrupt bunch of law folks and their involvement in the drug business out of Las Vegas. We think Foxx's character, Vincent, is dirty for much of the film. I guess that adds some cloak and dagger extra baggage that's supposed to be clever? While I did find Foxx's character interesting I felt as if he wasn't ever equipped to be a one-man hall of justice. Going it alone, for the most part, he had to survive too many sure-fire deadly encounters with his own, and his hostage son's, life. Everything just kept getting worse to which believable realism was jettisoned.. The makers must have thought if they could bring the action bigger that credibility wouldn't matter? They forgot it was trying to be a real crime thriller early on. in the end there was too much silly action and not enough possible truth. This may prove Foxx can also be an action star, but this movie is entirely disposable and will be forgotten as fast as one leaves the theater. Foxx can't change that even as he survives to be declared a \"good cop\". I recommend a pass as there are too many much better crime flicks that respect the viewer's time with something approaching reality. This is a silly fail.",
         "As far as police corruption flicks go this one tends to line the bottom of the barrel as far as content is concerned. Although it was a fast moving film the characters held inside a casino for the entire length of the movie became monotonous. Since the inception of how policemen take the wrong turn during their career it often shows the rare cop who plunges face first into the mess trying to figure out just who is the bad guy, and who is not. Jamie Foxx plays Vincent Down. An internal affairs undercover policemen charged with finding corruption at its core. Starting with the robbery of Novac's drug supply, which was supposed to be delivered to another source as some kind of kickback or future plans to keeping his business rolling. Amidst this subtle chaos is another internal affairs officer played by Jennifer Bryant who is convinced that Downs is one of the corrupt, and must take him into custody or die trying. But not everything goes as planned when Downs's son is kidnapped by Rubino (Dermot Mulroney) in order for the drugs to be delivered to Novak on time. With plot twists, and strange occurrences popping up all over the casino it was a wonder nobody went insane in the first five minutes. The story became too complicated to follow at one point where you are hoping someone or one of the stars were killed just to put him or her out of their misery in order for the tale to end. Shooting an entire film within a structure often tends to miss-guide audiences for the simple reason that using tension other than car chases or city wide marathons to catch the bad guys leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Examples of such films are 123 Pelham or Die hard series or Raid on Entebbe. The idea is sound but often too boring to make it worthwhile unless a lot of psychological aspects are melded in with just the right amount of edgy violence to make it more appealing, much like Dog Day Afternoon with Al Pacino. Still with Sleepless it did have enough violence, which could have led to the rest of the city but it didn't. It was almost as if an invisible force had the only key to freedom, and everyone else was a hostage without them knowing it. It didn't work in that sense. It could have been more broad if Downs, and his son escaped the casino leading the others to follow their trail along with the internal affairs officers or even throw in Dena who is Downs' wife who could be concerned about her ex-husband, and son rather than leaping into unknown territory without a plan. The music was excellent as a tension builder, the action was good too. But the plot, and ingredients needed more pizazz keeping it city wide than in just one building alone. One of Jamie's finer roles because his acting is done extremely well to show his love, and compassion for those around him as he tries to protect his family. Will Smith could have also done this role too. I wouldn't be surprised if he was already approached to do it. I would say it is a good filler until some of the more high end block busters begin to fill the silver screens in the summer. Beyond that Sleepless to me is a decent watch. Hopefully there might be another instalment leading us off with the DEA as another entity who are corrupt that we noticed at the end of the feature. Maybe then a city wide escapade would work a hell of a lot better than just inside a casino. Recommended to those who like corruption stories.",
         "Crime Thrillers seem to be the rage this weekend, as this is my third movie with the genre tag to review. My latest review is on Sleepless starring Jamie Foxx. From the trailers, this film looks like a mash up of Triple 9 with Taken, and perhaps with a lower budget. Can the man of many talents make this movie, or is it just another knock off meant to take our money. Robbie K here and as always please read on for my input on the latest films to hit the silver screen. LIKES: \u0095 Complicated Crime Story \u0095 Michelle Monaghan's dynamic character \u0095 Humorous Summary: For those worrying about this being another mindless action flick, you have nothing to worry about. Sleepless is more convoluted relationships and chasing rabbit holes than anything else. Much of the story centers on trying to uncover the truth behind a massive drug dispensing ring and who the true leader is. There is not much more I can say past this simplistic plot, but this predictable theme remains constant throughout the entire tale. In fact, the only good thing past this simplicity is Michelle Monaghan's character, a very passionate (and obsessive) cop caught between a lot of rocks and hard places. Her fiery determination, single minded sense of justice, and act first ask later attitude adds the needed excitement to this otherwise bland tale. And the movie is surprisingly humorous, though how much is on purpose vs. accidental remains to be seen. Much of the movie has very \"silly\" moments that had me laughing by how cheesy and out of place it was (e.g. random people showing up, surprisingly bright dealers forgetting to check things, and a seemingly endless supply of ammunition). These ridiculous notions made a targeted serious movie, end up an indirect comedy for this reviewer. DISLIKES \u0095 Gets stale quickly \u0095 Dropped concepts that don't work \u0095 Action nothing like Taken \u0095 Lacked a uniform direction Summary: As I mentioned earlier, Sleepless main theme is walking around a casino trying to find the goods. This endless game of hide and go seek the drug got old fast, as a giant bag full of cocaine continued to disappear despite all the high technology and hired help. Watching Foxx and the rest of the cast go in endless circles lost its entertainment value quickly, and lacked very little suspense. In addition, much of the concepts they highlighted in the trailers did not last long in this movie, which was very disappointing to say the least. The whole kidnap the kid and try to find him was over in five minutes, and the rest of the drama was very lackluster compared to the other films I saw this weekend. An even bigger disappointment was the lack of real action in this movie, a big selling point promoted in the trailers. Surprise, surprise, the action is diluted down to a few staged fist fights and a little shoot out that won't be high on the most thrilling fights list. For this reviewer, all these shortcomings came from what seemed a lack of direction in what type of movie they wanted. Instead of an epic action movie with a crime theme, we got a circular tale where nothing was really accomplished until the final ten minutes. This my friends is the biggest shortcoming of the film, and the missed potential it held. The VERDICT: Sleepless certainly doesn't live up to its name, as I found myself fighting sleep from the boredom I had watching this tale. Outside a convoluted crime ring, and some humorous antics, this movie did not deliver the thrills it set its sights on. If you're looking for a gory, adventure where we walk around a fancy casino, then check this movie out, but this reviewer encourages you to save the time (and money) by skipping this movie. I can maybe suggest if for Netflix, but even that is a bit of a stretch for this movie for me. My scores are: Action/Crime/Thriller: 4.0 Movie Overall: 4.0",
         "I'm absolutely amazed that this film has an average rating of 5.5. Who ever gave it 5 or more stars must have watched a different film than me. Even the great Jamie Fox was terrible in this. Either he wasn't trying because he knew it was guff or it's true what they say about the actor being only as good as the story.",
         "Before review Sleepless i want you guys to know this movie and Arsenal are both rated R for the first time in my country and after hearing many good thing about this movie so i decided to check out this movie and oh boy .......I WAS WRONG.I divided this movie into three parts , the first part is very good both our main heroes Jamie Foxx and Michelle Monaghan are well development .They both has a hard past to push them forward not just for the sake of action but went the movie get into the second part it started to fall apart.There are so many plot hole and character make very dumb decision like in one scene after the bad guys kidnapping Jamie Foxx son and torture him then walked away and left the door open for the kid to escape and tracking him to leads to where his father hiding .I MEAN LIKE SERIOUSLY DID THE DIRECTOR THINK IM GOING TO FALL FOR THAT.THE WHOLE GOOD FIGHT SCENE AND GOOD CINEMATOGRAPHY CAN NOT MAKE UP FOR THIS MESSY OF A MOVIE IF YOU LIKE A GOOD CRIME ACTION MOVIE THAT TAKE PLACE IN ONE NIGHT I SUGGESTED COLLATERAL , RUNNING SCARED OR SAFE IT MUCH MORE BETTER THAN THIS MOVIE",
         "This is the kind of movie that starts bad and gets worse by the end of it. The plot is unoriginal, predictable, fight scenes are awful to watch, the acting is just sad. Although there are quite a few stars, or at least well know actors in the movie, this is a huge let down. If you value your time, i advise you not to watch it. And you want to know whats even worse? I cant believe they planned it to actually have a sequel! The only good thing about this movie is that it lasts 90 min, so even though it pains to watch, it doesn't last that long.",
         "just another, empth, shitty movie with good cop, dirty cop, bad cops, and some psycho criminal. Wouldn't pay a dime to watch it at the movies. Something already done in the past by the fantastic denzel washington (training day). The finale is also sloppy leaving room for sleepless 2, which I am not even going to bother considering.",
         "Sleepless, they really should've called this movie \"Sleeping\", as it's exactly what the audience will be doing as they trudge through this 90 minute thriller that fails to ignite in any way, shape or form as Jamie (real name Eric Marlon Bishop) Foxx's in over his head cop Vincent Down's goes to a hotel/casino and then spends of the rest of the film's running time there as he battles baddies and try's to right his wrongs. A remake of the 2011 French film Sleepless Night, Sleepless has the potential to be a high concept action/thriller with twists, turns, bumps and bruises but as directed by Switzerland based Baran bo Odar, this bargain bin worthy experience is an utter waste of story potential and talent potential as Foxx is joined by slumming it co-stars such as Michelle Monaghan and Scott McNairy (sporting what could well be the years worst feature film hair-do), who all try to no avail to plug the many various holes in this sinking ship. It's been some years since our last Foxx hit, we go all the way back to Django Unchained for this, and Sleepless does feel as though we are seeing Foxx enter into new territory where he begins to find himself headlining rather lethargic procedurals. A shame for an Oscar winning actor that can do and should do much better than this film that surely couldn't have read well on paper. It has been many a year too since Monaghan has found herself making use of her considerable talent, while Scoot McNairy continues on a recent run of impressive and standout turns in not particularly great features but you get the sense the hardworking character actor is quite close to delivering a genuinely unmissable performance in a film worthy of it. Other elements of Sleepless are barely worth discussing as Odar try's but fails to bring energy into the film. Bad guys do bad guy things, cops try to do good things and often fail and Gabrielle Union gets angry at Foxx's Vincent for being a bad daddy, it's truly hard for the watcher to care as no one here is likable enough or disposable enough to invest in and as is the usual with films of this ilk, it's not hard to see where things are heading with about 30 minutes of dull action still to transpire. Final Say \u2013 Taking place in Sin City itself Las Vegas, Sleepless commits the mortal thriller sin of being utterly boring, predictable and overly pedestrian. Barely making use of its big name cast and doing nothing we haven't seen before and seen done a lot better, Sleepless is a dull, forgettable and lifeless event that should be avoided at all costs. 1 bag of sugar out of 5",
         "So there's an active shooter in a nightclub, an active sports car swirling around in the nightclub, an inactive bystander, the police show up and guess who all 7 police officers focus on? You just got hold of a gun in a life threatening situation and you bravely decide to use your fist against an attacker who is bigger than you. You're on a manhunt in an underground garage and you shoot smoke canisters without any gadgets to give you an advantage in the scenario you've just created and then you start firing indiscriminately. I give it a 2 for the established reputation of the cast but this must be the worst movie I ever saw.",
         "The story makes no sense literally I wish I knew before how bad this is. It the stereotype divorced under-covered cop dedicated to his job story, but this one is taken to the absurd. I watched it expecting a good movie given the cast but every action in this movie is irrational. I felt ashamed for the actors at moments, trying to understand how did the cope with their role and the questions they had for the director while filming. I hope Jamie doesn't go Wesley Snipes path... Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie!",
         "The new Jamie Foxx action flick SLEEPLESS is a bit bi-polar as it alternates from surprising (sometimes for the good and sometimes for the bad) and NOT surprising (sometimes for the good sometimes for the bad). SURPRISING:  Jamie Foxx tamps down his natural charm to play \"against type\" as a crooked cop who rips off a drug dealer. NOT SURPRISING:  Because of this, the first 1/2 hour of this film is a mess.  Foxx is boring, the rapid-fire patter of his partner (played by hip-hop artist T.I.) is annoying and Michelle Monaghan plays a tough female cop trying to prove herself to her male counterparts, yet again. SURPRISING:  A fight scene in a kitchen at about the 1/2 hour mark was actually pretty entertaining, making me sit up from the slumped position I was in and thought \"okay...perhaps there is some hope for this film.\" NOT SURPRISING:  David Harbour - who has made a career out of playing bad cops shows up as a cop who might (or might not) be bad. SURPRISING:  As the film draws towards the final battle, Foxx has given up downplaying his natural charm and I found myself actively rooting for him. NOT SURPRISING:  Gabriel Union, in the obligatory \"wife on the phone\" roll decides to leave the safety of where she is at and meet Foxx where the final battle takes place.  Do you think she'll get involved? SURPRISING:  The over-the-top finale as staged by director Baron bo Odar was terrifically over-the-top.  And the film, up to this point, had no indication of this.  It was as if the Director said \"Screw it, we're going for it\" - and it works (at least for me)! NOT SURPRISING:  Dermot Mulroney (or is it Dylan McDermot?) and Scoot McNairy put in good,fun supporting performances. SURPRISING:  They actually set this film up for a sequel! NOT SURPISING:  This film won't win any Oscars nor will we break up into discussion groups afterward. SURPRISING:  My rating 6 stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",
         "You may go sleepless while watching this abduction thriller with a couple of stars, Jamie Foxx and Michelle Monaghan. They're Las Vegas PD detectives involved in drug busting with all the kidnap, corruption components in place. The outstanding element is the awareness that an Oscar winner--Foxx--can be wasted in a hum-drum actioner that surprises not at all. Believe me when I tell you that if you stirred Liam Neeson in with this script, you'd know the difference only by the skin color of the kidnapped children. Although director Odar does a competent job with the foot races and car chases, they are still boiler-plate staples of the genre. While Foxx spends most of the film improbably finding his son, losing him, finding him again in an almost Groundhog Day motif, the action becomes tedious quickly. His life-threatening-wound is ludicrously not debilitating except for a few high-priced Oscar grunts that end up immobilizing a goon or two who have no similar disabilities. It was a dismal afternoon when I saw Sleepless because I love cinematic visuals and watching Michelle make something out of nothing. Otherwise, you'll be more careful about the safety of your children. That's the good part.",
         "The two decades on either side of the new millennium seem to have been the heyday of movies about corrupt cops. After some pretty corny cop movies in the 1980s, 1990 started off its decade pretty well with \"Q & A\" and \"Internal Affairs\". As we moved through the 90s, Hollywood served up \"Bad Lieutenant\", \"Unlawful Entry\", \"Léon: The Professional\", \"Cop Land\" and the Best Picture Oscar nominee \"L.A. Confidential\". In the first decade of the 21st century, we got a chance to enjoy Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning performance in \"Training Day\", followed by the underrated pair \"Cellular\" and \"16 Blocks\" and, of course, the Best Picture Oscar winner \"The Departed\". The current decade has given us less popular dirty cop movies like \"Rampart\" and \"The Place Beyond the Pines\". 2017's \"Sleepless\" (R, 1:35) has things in common with the corrupt cop movies of the previous decade and those of the 90s. The movie opens with Las Vegas police partners in crime prevention (and crime), Vincent Downs (Jamie Foxx) and Sean Cass (T.I.) stealing a bag of cocaine from a group of hooded thugs that they unceremoniously dispatch in the process. When their sergeant is assigning a team to investigate the homicide scene, Downs and Cass convince him to give them the case. Meanwhile, in the same department, Internal Affairs detective Jennifer Bryant (Michelle Monaghan) is recovering from a drug bust gone wrong. Bryant's partner, Doug Dennison (David Harbour) and the police psychologist express concern for Bryant's mental and physical state, but she insists on getting back to work. Bryant is also investigating the aforementioned drug murder because shell casings from police ammunition were found at the scene. As the story progresses, Bryant becomes convinced that Downs isn't what he seems. Things get dicier when it is revealed that the cocaine that Downs and Cass stole belongs to casino owner Stanley Rubino (Dermot Mulroney). Rubino sends more masked thugs to kidnap Downs' son, Thomas (Octavius Johnson) and demands that Downs bring the drugs to his casino if he ever wants to see his son again. As Downs is trying to hide his son's predicament from the teen's mother, Dena (Gabrielle Union), the person for whom Rubino was transporting the drugs, ruthless local crime boss Robert Novak (Scott McNairy) comes looking for his coke. All this drama descending upon Rubino's casino is compounded when Bryant and Dennison, who have been following Downs, show up at the casino and work to figure out what's going on. This leads to a series of escalating confrontations and rising stakes for all involved. \"Sleepless\" is entertaining, but forgettable and fails to live up to its potential. This is a remake of the 2011 French thriller \"Sleepless Night\", but can't match that film's adept storytelling and high tension. Several plot points in this American version are suspect at best, although the excellent cast helps draw you in and there are a couple decent twists late in the story. The plotting feels like a throwback to genre movies of the late 80s and early 90s and the overall quality is as unremarkable as the corrupt cop tales from earlier in the 2010s. \"Sleepless\" is good enough to keep you awake and somewhat engaged, but it isn't impactful enough to keep you up at night thinking about it. \"B-\"",
         "This movie wants so bad to be something akin to Michael Mann's \"Miami Vice\" or \"Heat\", but it so isn't. This would be one of the crime action movie that would periodically come out in the late 90s - early 2000s that I'd come across on HBO one evening to kill a couple hours and it would serve its purpose. That is basically this movie, and that's okay. This movie is pretty consistently entertaining; whether that be in terms of its action or some of the dumb things found in the writing. \"Sleepless\" takes place in Las Vegas where a seemingly dirty cop, played by Jami Foxx, steals drugs from the wrong crime lords and so they kidnap his teenage son in exchange for their drugs back. From there it is up to Foxx to save his son from the drug kingpins portrayed by Dermot Mulroney and Scoot McNairy, all while an Internal Affairs agent (Michelle Monaghan) pursues him amidst the chaos. I'll have to get into some minor spoilers from here. Jamie Foxx plays a dirty cop that stole drugs from Dermot Mulroney and in an attempt to exchange the stolen drugs to get his son back, Foxx stashes the majority in a bathroom ceiling until he can be sure that his son is alive. That's all good and well, but with Monaghan investigating what Foxx is up to, she finds the drugs. Instead of making the bathroom a crime scene, calling in backup, or taking the drugs into her headquarters as evidence she stashes the drugs somewhere else in the hotel. Unrealistic to say the least. Or the fact that 90% of this movie has Jamie Foxx dealing with a stab wound in his stomach. Which he treats it more or less like an annoyance that he has to occasionally check on. Anyways, whenever Foxx discovers that the drugs are missing, his solution is to make his way into a kitchen and stuff a duffel- bag full of powdered sugar in hopes to trick the baddies. Presenting the bag, while it and himself are obviously covered in sugar. Foxx does well in his role, at times I did this to myself how this could have been a spin-off Tubbs movie with just a few rewrites. The villains played by Mulroney and McNairy are kind of ridiculous in their attempts to outshine one another with how much of dick they can be. That kept me entertained. There are more than one plot twists and if you have ever seen a movie like this then you know absolutely where it's going at all times. *SPOILER ALERT* Jamie Foxx isn't actually a dirty cop, he's undercover. Michelle Monaghan's partner that is constantly trying to get her to go home and let him handle things...BIG SHOCK...turns out he's dirty. I know, I know. You never saw it coming...if you have literally never seen a movie before. But, again, that is what amused me about this movie. Especially since I've seen that actor who played her partner portray a terrifying serial killer before, so the second he pops up on screen I said to myself \"well he's probably got a severed finger stashed in his desk for prosperity's sake\"...okay, it never went that far. It was still obvious he was in on it though. Oh, not only does Foxx get his son kidnapped once in this movie but actually twice! Twice!! And instead of going straight to Monaghan with his son to get directly out of the Casino they're trapped in. He tries to avoid her only to result in his son getting captured yet again after they figured out the drugs he gave them were bogus. Again, not feeling like a natural or logical progression of the story, but rather a dire need to pad out the film as long as possible. So that pretty much from there keeps the movie scrambling until it can finally reach a suitable length and hit its climax. So once Foxx faces off against McNairy, Foxx is shot in the stomach. His wife and son are rushing him to the hospital, concurrently to that, Monaghan and her partner (David Harbour) has arrested Mulroney. Those three are sitting in a car being driven by a police escort when Monaghan receives a call from Foxx revealing to her a voicemail left by her partner that completely incriminates himself being in on the drugs and working with the bad guys and also backs up Foxx's story on being undercover...who leaves a voicemail that would contain all that vital information?! A desperate screenwriter, that's who. Now that isn't the dumbest part about this. The real kicker is instead of Monaghan acting cool until they got to the police station and then arresting him...her bright idea is to immediately act suspicious, put her gun right in Harbour's grasp. That way he can shoot her, their key witness, and the escorting cop causing their car to wreck; don't worry though, it's okay because it turned out that him and Monaghan survived so she could finger him for the crime...seriously, she got two people murdered...then the movie has the balls to sequel-bait with a crooked DEA agent answering a call on McNairy's phone talking to his father saying, \"Sir, we have a problem\"...cut to credits...HA! This movie ain't getting a sequel. Granted, I am totally on board if it does. This movie is dumb, nonsensical, and at times flat out absurd. Luckily for this movie, I have a soft spot for stupid. The action scenes, while nothing new, are easy to follow and well done. The acting is honestly solid from all parties. The direction has potential and I felt as the director really wanted to make this as cool as possible; the writing held it back though. So I recommend everyone buy this movie only so I can get my sequel...that's just hilarious.",
         "Maybe if you haven't seen the original, you will enjoy it, particularly if you like a thrilling clash between the cops and gangsters. For me this is the third version from the last three consecutive years. After the original French film based on the same name of the book, followed by the Kollywood remake 'Thoongavanam'. The second film was not bad, considering the way it was made to the Indian standards. They did not change much, but in this one the initial parts were almost the same and the following developments were too much. I mean literally they turned it into twice thriller with tight action sequences. Their main idea was to leave the open conclusion for a possible sequel. Which was really too intentional that not everybody would be happy with, for like those who liked the previous versions. The actors were good, but Michelle Monaghan was the best among. Unlike the same characters from other versions, I don't know how they turned Monaghan's role so powerful. That's the negative, as the film Jamie Foxx in the lead. Otherwise, as a neutral, this is not a bad remake. The Immigrant joke was trimmed off, since today's US is not in favour of such comedies in films. And many events, especially film scenes were accelerated. So the camera moves one place to another in a quick succession unlike other versions. Yeah, these changes were needed, since the film was not a fresh piece of work or even first remake. But like I said too muchness spoiled the party. Even though one time watchable film. 6/10",
         "Sometimes, good movies don't have a chance to amount to anything during their theatrical release. The Jamie Foxx & Michelle Monaghan thriller \"Sleepless\" spent eight weeks in theaters before Universal Pictures pulled it from exhibition. Ultimately, this movie coined less than its cost, falling shy of its $30-million budget. Nevertheless, despite its poor box office take, this suspenseful saga set in Las Vegas exemplified exciting melodrama at its best where the good guys and the bad guys find themselves caught in a crack. Jamie Fox plays veteran detective Vincent Downs on the trail of the villains, while Michelle Monaghan is cast as Internal Affairs police officer Bryant who wants Down's scalp for his alleged illegal activities. \"Straight Outta Compton\" scenarist Andrea Berloff does a slam-bang job of keeping the characters at one another's throats. Scoot McNairy is a short-fused, murderous, adversary who has no qualms about killing anybody, not even when his enemies turn out be some of his own relatives who have passing information to the DEA. Character actor David Harbour of \"Quantum of Solace\" and \"The Equalizer\" may be the only weak link in this pulsating crime saga because he suffers from continually being cast as amoral dastard. Meantime, the action is fast. gritty, and nail-biting. Several characters wind up in body bags, primarily the villains, but even our hero and heroine have reasons to fuss about his or her fate. Swiss director Baran bo Odar bottles the violence up effectively in one Las Vegas single casino on a night where the narcotics exchange is scheduled to transpire. Nobody had planned for everything to go sideways, but they struggle to take advantage of their predicaments. Clocking in at 95 minutes, \"Sleepless\" qualifies as the kind of thriller that never wears out its welcome. Andrea Berloff's no-nonsense screenplay bristles with several surprises, particularly an evil-doesn't-perish ending that suggests the villains are regrouping for the future.",
         "copy of french movie, i don't expect this from good actors at list they should wait some years to remake movies,it was a very good movie the first, and them did exactly the same story copy paste. if this would be make from china or south Korea i will understand. anyway they played very good but i am disappointing."
