         "content": "For some reason I thought this was Tracy Morgan's comeback show after the infamous car accident which turned deadly for one of his co-riders thinking it would be about him dealing with that and overcome it but this was filmed 2 months before that accident.\r\n\r\nSo it's mostly just sex jokes, oral sex jokes in particular and some race jokes and other things but 80% sex jokes or jokes relating somehow to sex.\r\n\r\nNot seen Tracy Morgan in a stand up before so I can't say if he's better or worse than usual, I do like him as a comedic actor though and he's usually alot funnier in movies and series.\r\n\r\nThe crowd was easily amused though, laughing at all his jokes. And to be fair, stand up isn't my favorite form of comedy in general.",
