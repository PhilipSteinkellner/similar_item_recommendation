         "Let me get this out of the way: I LOVED Obvious Child, the first film by director Gillian Robespierre that also starred Jenny Slate. Despite the lack of a similar hook for Landline (most of the discussion over what it was about just seemed to be \"it takes place in the 90s) I was still very excited to see it. Unfortunately it failed to live up to my expectations and to the early promise that the Robespierre/Slate collaboration showed. Landline is indeed set in the mid 90s but it is focused on the romantic relationships of the Jacobs which is comprised of a father who is a copy-writer and failed playwright, a mother whose job I never quite caught, an academic daughter, and a youngest daughter still in school. The eldest daughter Dana (Jenny Slate, both annoying and adorable) is engaged and in a long term relationship. After she runs into an ex-boyfriend she ends up sleeping with him and the two start an affair. At nearly the same time younger sister Ali discovers erotic poems her father has written to his mistress. Bound together by this hideous secret the two of them begin to try to discover their father's mistress while trying to protect their mother from the awful revelation. There is a lot to enjoy about Landline including all the 90s references which aren't over the top but are nicely woven in. At the same time, the script is a bit of a mess and though the film is trying to meditate on long-term relationships and sexual fidelity the last third is so rushed (a very important relationship is rebuilt over a ridiculously short one minute montage) that it undercuts any poignancy the film might have. Slate once again proves herself best in show. Robespierre allows her to be over the top and ridiculous (this is a character who openly snorts when she laughs) and she really runs with it. I'll still look forward to any collaborations director and muse have in the future, but with more tempered expectations.",
         "Landline Cheating on your spouse in the 1990s was more acceptable because the President was doing it. However, according to this comedy it didn't make it any less upsetting on the children. While twenty-something-year-old Dana (Jenny Slate) is cheating on her fiancé (Jay Duplass) with her ex (Finn Wittrock), she learns from her teenage sister Ali (Abby Quinn) that their father (John Turturro) has been having an affair on their mother (Edie Falco). This bombshell not only helps to reconnect the estranged siblings, but also forces Dana to confront her own infidelity and for Ali to face her growing drug addiction. While it's enjoyable to relive the nineties, there is little else to enjoy about this run-of-the-mill period piece. With a derivative narrative about a New York affair, flat punch lines and unlikeable leads, Landline is best left disconnected. Besides, who needed to cheat in the 1990s when landlines offered 3-way? Red Light",
         "The story felt a little generic but the film's makers put their stank into it and made it fresh. Felt almost felt like a Woody Allen movie he did not make because of all the cheating going on in it. The typical story of a family going through hard times. This particular tale revolves around two sisters who discover dad's stepping out on mom, but one of the sister should not throw bricks at glass houses. Did a good job of putting us in the 90s. It seems like there was no real need for the movie to have taken place in the 90s unless the filmmakers were really sold on the name of the film. You see the landlines in the film but they don't really do anything for the story, but there were a few funny moments (really just two) about being a teen in the 90s and the technology available to us.   The characters are really good and the actors give great performances as them, which is what really makes the movie over anything else.   Liked it. http://cinemagardens.com",
         "\"Whatever happened do Jenny Slate?\" (It would be understandable to ask that question \u2013 before 2016-2017.) \"Isn't she the girl who accidentally dropped the f-bomb in her first appearance on Saturday Night Live and then got fired at the end of the season?\" (Yes and yes.) \"Has she even done anything since?\" (Yes!) Slate was a stand-up comedian when she started appearing on TV shows in 2005. After her productive but ill-fated season on SNL (2009-2010), she really\u0085 came out of her shell. Slate and film director and editor Dean Fleischer- Camp (to whom she was married from 2012 to 2016) created the \"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On\" books and short films, with Slate voicing the title character. She then appeared in several TV shows (some at the same time), including \"House of Lies\", \"Parks and Recreation\", \"Kroll Show\" and \"Married\". She then voiced more animated characters in \"Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked\" (2011) and \"The Lorax\" (2012). Slate started really showing her talent as a feature film actress in 2014's \"Obvious Child\" and then\u0085 2016-2017 happened. In 2016-17, she voiced major characters in the high-profile animated features \"Zootopia\", \"The Secret Life of Pets\" and \"The LEGO Batman Movie\". Later in 2017, she continued staking her claim to a prestigious film career in movies like \"Gifted\" and, the subject of this review, the comedy-drama \"Landline\" (R, 1:37). Slate plays Dana Jacobs, a young NYC woman who finds herself at a crossroads. She's newly engaged to a kind, but milquetoast guy named Ben (Jay Duplass), but she reconnects with Nate (Finn Wittrock), an old flame from college, and she feels like she needs some time to figure out what she really wants. She leaves the apartment that she shares with Ben and moves back home, using the excuse that her younger sister, Ali (Abby Quinn), needs her. Ali is trying hard to be a hip chick and deciding where she's going to go to college, but what concerns her the most at the moment is her parents. She has come across some indication that her playwright father (John Turturro) is cheating on her mother (Edie Falco). As the two sisters try to get to the bottom of what their father is up to, they begin bonding as never before and Ali is able to help her older sister decide how to move forward in her life. Since this story takes place in 1995, a lot of the conversations take place over telephones mounted on walls, hence the film's title. \"Landline\" is a heartfelt and humorous examination of life choices within the context of one family. (It is, however not to be confused with another 2017 movie with the same title and starring Matthew Aaron, Khalid Abour and Tom Arnold.) The later (and more widely distributed) \"Landline\" is well-written by Elizabeth Holm and well- directed by Gillian Robespierre (both of whom also did the same jobs and collaborated with Slate on \"Obvious Child\"). They give us a story that is well-paced, relatable, engaging and funny at just the right moments. The acting is excellent, especially by Slate who has maintained her excellent comic timing while emerging as a fine actress. Although the plot seems slight at times, it's strong on insight into issues of romance and family relations and makes for quality entertainment. \"B+\"",
         "1995 was a far simpler time for interpersonal communication, right? Well, at the very least, Gillian Robespierre's \"Landline\" would have played out much differently set in the smartphone era. The \"Obvious Child\" filmmaker re-teams with co-writer Elisabeth Holm and star Jenny Slate to tell the story of a Manhattan family that appears to be falling apart when the teenage daughter discovers evidence that her father's having an affair. As with \"Obvious Child,\" no topic is off limits for Robespierre, especially not sex, drugs and other poor choices. Teenager Ali (Abby Quinn) is a rebel child who sneaks off to clubs and dabbles in hard drugs; working professional Dana (Slate) becomes disenchanted with her fiancé (Jay Duplass) and starts falling for a high school ex and there's no shortage of outspoken marital discord between the father (John Turturro) and mother (Edie Falco). Robespierre handles each of the film's serious issues in earnest, but there's a comedic whimsy that floats through every scene, especially when Slate is involved. Robespierre and Holm's voice as a writing duo is unfiltered - both mature and immature at the same time. Slate does her best work in that gray area and continues to be an underutilized talent. Turturro and Falco are no slouches (in a year with some great movie parents) and they also recognize the dual tones of the film, even if they don't get to hold the narrative for much of the runtime. Moments of human connection are the touchstones of this story, especially under humorous pretenses. Not all that much about these moments is profound, but they're honest and relatable - nothing is fake or manipulated for comedy to an extent that feels aimed at laughter more than truth. And even though the '90s setting feels mostly about fun throwback references, it works to the film's advantage in creating a greater contrast between scenes of in-person connection and moments when characters distance themselves from each other. In today's world, there is no separation. \"Landline\" would have made more of a splash if in the end it wasn't simply a film about owning up to and accepting flaws. It arrives there on its own thoughtful path - an agreeable path that's true to its characters - but the themes are just a little obvious. For the right viewer at the right time, however, they will strike home in a deep way. A good example of the really positive direction independent coming-of-age films have taken in the 2010s, \"Landline\" shows that Robespierre has a deep understanding of what kind of storytelling is resonating with young adults. Namely, she understands formula and situation and anything remotely glossy doesn't cut it. Her film exudes the authenticity, specifically the desire to dig into the questioning and unflattering sides of ourselves, that more mainstream films sorely lack. ~Steven C Thanks for reading!

         "\"Landline\" (2017 release; 93 min.) brings the story of the Jacobs family. As the movie opens, we are reminded that it is \"Labor Day, 1995\". The family (husband Alan, wife Pat, grown-up daughter Dana and her fiancé Ben, and HS senior Ali) are driving back to New York City from their country estate. Everyone settles back in: Dana works are an indie newspaper, and Ali is supposed to start her last year of high school but has drugs on her mind more than books. It's not long that Ali finds out that dad (Alan) may be having an affair, much to the horror of Ali and Dana. Meanwhile, Dana bumps into an ex-boyfriend at a party she is attending with Ben. At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie. What will become of all these characters? To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out. Couple of comments: this movie marks the reunion of writer-director Gillian Robespierre and producer-actress Jenny Slate, who previously collaborated on \"Obvious Child\" (Slate's break-out role). Here they bring another movie that is billed as a comedy, but in reality is just as much a relationships drama. And there is plenty of drama (biting my lip--mustn't spoil!). Of course there are plenty of lighter moments too. One can't help but smile when we see Dana check her voice mail by calling from a public phone, and many other such 90s-specific things. Jenny Slater once again shines in this movie, and it is her character that seems most authentic--in contrast to her sister Ali, who is supposed to be a HS senior, but comes across much older. John Turturro (as Alan) and Jay DuPlass (as Ben) are in fine form as well. Bottom line, this movie kept my attention from start to finish, and I wasn't quite ready to say goodbye to these characters when the end titles started rolling, the surest sign that I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. \"Landline\" premiered at this year's Sundance Film Festival to positive buzz. The movie finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday matinée screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great (about 10 people). Hopefully this movie will benefit from positive word-of-mouth as well as wider exposure on VOD, and eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. \"Landline\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",
         "A school of thought says that monogamy is enhanced by infidelity, a counter-intuitive theory that writer/director Gillian Robespierre and writer Elisabeth Holm appear to support in their engaging comedy, Landline. The family of two girls, Dana (Jenny Slate) and Ali (Abby Quinn), Mom (Edie Falco) and Dad (John Turturro) are in constant dysfunctional mode with two major infidelities and a few drugs. It's really a dramady because the resolutions of conflicts rest in some serious soul searching while the writers have kept enough light tone to lift spirits when gloom seems to be the order of the day. Laughs are more an expression of agreement that life is messy. The antidote is humor and love. Easy enough when dad cries out that his infidelity is borne of never being what his wife wanted him to be. Then Dana embarks on an affair to neutralize her fears of marriage. Both indiscretions seem to be rooted in insecurity. This bright indie respects the humanity of its characters so that it makes no judgment but rather celebrates their weaknesses and emphasizes their strengths and also believes that in 1995 the world is ready for an easy bridge from tape to floppies to digital, from eyebrow rings to tattoos. The film's good will extends to minor characters like Dana's lover,Nate (Finn Whitrock), a pleasant former school chum with a resemblance to John Davidson, in other words wholesome with a cute smile. The film allows that such a romance is not outlandish, just morally questionable so as to endanger her engagement. Equally so dad's affair, although we never get to know his paramour. Mostly Landline is about people who stay connected, not by current restrictive social media but by talking. This retro way of communicating might be the film's subtle prescription for long-term happiness.",
         "This film tells the story of two sisters who discover that their father is having an affair. They deal with it in different ways. The story also tells the love story of every major character in the film. It tells how every person relates to the world around them, and how they connect with their significant others. It is very real life like, and hence it can feel draggy and boring at times. All the couples involved have different outcomes, and it gets interesting and reflective at the end.",
         "'LANDLINE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The new comedy-drama that reteams filmmaker Gillian Robespierre with actress Jenny Slate; they last teamed together in 2014's 'OBVIOUS CHILD'. The film tells the story of two sisters, in 1995 Manhattan, that suspect their dad is cheating on their mom. Robespierre directed and co-wrote the movie, with Elisabeth Holm and Tom Bean, and Slate plays the elder sister Dana. It also costars Abby Quinn (as the younger sister Ali), Edie Falco (as their mom), John Turturro (as their dad) and Jay Duplass (as Dana's fiancé). The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics (although not as good as 'OBVIOUS CHILD'), and it's now playing in indie theaters. The film is hard to watch at times, but it's very well made and moving. The story takes place in Manhattan (in 1995), where teenager Ali (Quinn) lives with her parents, Alan (Turturro) and Pat (Falco). Her older sister, Dana (Slate), is (seemingly) happily engaged to Ben (Duplass). Then Dana runs into an old lover (Finn Wittrock), and her loyalty to Ben is tested. Ali also learns that her father has probably been cheating on her mother. The two sisters try to deal with these problems together. The film is definitely not as upbeat and sweet as 'OBVIOUS CHILD' (which was one of my favorite movies of 2014), but it is just as emotional, in a somewhat darker way though. It's hard to watch at times, but it seems very true to life. The performances are all good in it, and Robespierre is definitely turning into a very impressive filmmaker to watch for. I highly recommend it. Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/PdeLWCp_JrI",
         "LANDLINE (2017) *** Jenny Slate, Abby Quinn, John Turturro, Edie Falco, Jay Duplass, Finn Wittrock. Woody Allen-lite could best describe this dramedy about a NYC family who are going thru several crises largely due to infidelities and identity confirmations. Slate and Quinn are the bickering siblings whose tight knit bond is forged via sarcasm and hearts on their sleeves as they discover their father (Turturro) is having an affair while they are both dealing with their own domestic pitfalls - inklings of wanting something more out of the relationships they both have with other paramours. Filmmaker Gillian Robespierre - who collaborated on the sharp, funny and cleverly warm hearted script with Elisabeth Holm and Tom Bean - has her nostalgia well intact setting the story in 1995 with a fun soundtrack and pre-Internet/cell phone absurdities. Slate's sexy cartoon voice and spiky vulnerability is no full-display and relative newcomer Quinn holds her own with punchy abrasive thrusts-and-parries verbally. An indie gem.",
         "Hark; the epitome of light and what is missing from films is at a new high. Not so much the cinematography, but the essence of filmography is normal. What separates this film from others in its' category is the bond. A mother, a daughter, and a first daughter. The despondent father is cruical to the first daughter (Ms. Slate). Mother is down-trodden so she turns to both. Being alive and the exact opposite of the willing suspension of disbelief carried this film; ever-expansive unto a world of \"non-Westside New Yorkers\". In the view of how transgression erects itself; not one person but Ms. Quinn. In her role; the passion for the \"live\" life excels her aura. First daughter is the care-giver in this whopping tale of family, feuds, and freshness. It is in the opinion of the author of this Review that Ms. Slate wins. Costuming was accurate and the sexual scenes were bountiful and hilarious. Real People Doing Real Things. Real People doing real things.",
         "A lighthearted humorous escape with some gorgeous looking people, some nostalgia, and a lot of wit. A family of four--father, mother, adult daughter and teenage daughter, living in New York City. Deals with themes of fidelity, secrets and commitment. Some things they leave you hanging for a while about. See it for a fun time.",
         "I really liked this movie. The 90's references are borderline over the top but oh so fun to absorb. The sisters are very believable as sisters--part allies and part antagonists. Edie Falco nails it. This is what I suppose would be labeled a 'dramedy', though it felt mostly like a comedy. The realistic and tender portrayals of adultery are very well done. I recommend."

         "Set in Manhattan in 1995, LANDLINE follows three women in one family having lots of sex, drugs, and Japanese food. Navigating monogamy, honesty, and a long-lost New York, the Jacobs family lives in the last days when people still didn't have cell phones and still did smoke inside. Teenage Ali discovers her dad's affair, her older sister Dana uncovers her own wild side, and their mother Pat grapples with the truth that she can't have it all, but her family still has each other. For a generation raised on divorce and wall-to-wall carpeting, LANDLINE is an honest comedy about what happens when sisters become friends and parents become humans.",
