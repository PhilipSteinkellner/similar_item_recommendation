But YouTube is my one of the major social network to hangout. As many reviewers said, it was an average film. Might be rated high by the fanboys. Though it could have been even worse. The same old, same old plot. Below par acting skills. The film particularly aimed for late 20s and early 30s people. The rest of the guys from different generation would find is unfunny.\r\n\r\nA young woman who recently lost her job, as well as broke up with her boyfriend, heads to her childhood summer camp to become a staff member where her two old friends already been serving. Time to recover from all the recent disaster stricken life, she's unable to cope and things take unusual turns to make events more complicated. The remaining story is to tell how she manages around.\r\n\r\nFor such a B movie, it is an acceptable. But beware of predictable storyline. The lines should have been very motivated, especially towards the end. There's no twist, if you already know it's coming and what it is. Too many adult jokes, otherwise the film would have attracted the youngsters, like teens and kids. Simply one time watchable film. Or you can find similar other great flicks out there.\r\n\r\n_5/10_",

      "synopsis": "The movie starts in Chicago, Illinois. An answering machine picks up, and it is heard that Elise Miller (Grace Helbig) and Jeff Sanford (Chester See) are getting married in a few weeks. The caller that leaves a message is a travel agent and is confirming details of their honeymoon trip to Paris. Sticky notes of French words are seen placed around the apartment, and Elise is going about her morning making breakfast and practicing the French words as she goes. She then goes into her bedroom, which she shares with her fiancé, and surprises him with breakfast in bed. However, he doesn't want to wake up, so Elise says she's pregnant to startle him and get him awake. Jeff places the breakfast on the bedside table and begins to talk to Elise. She tells him that she finally finished her book that morning and hadn't gone to sleep all night. She wants to celebrate with sex, but Jeff tells her that they both have to go to work. He then gets up and starts getting ready and Elise hugs him from behind while he is putting on his shirt. He snaps a little saying his shirt is expensive and doesn't want to get it ruined. She pulls back and asks him to get the rest of her stuff from her apartment, but he says he has a meeting and other things to do that day and won't be able to. Elise gets lattes at a street vender for herself, her boss, and a coworker, and as she leaves she bumps into Sally Meister (Ellen Karsten), the camp director at the all-girls camp, Camp Takota. She is in the city scouting out for counselors because they are a few short. Elise tells Sally about her engagement and honeymoon, but cringes when Sally mentions children. She says she's \"not really the offspring type,\" but if she was, her girls would definitely go to Camp Takota like she did when she was a kid. Elise then rushes to work and the two part ways. At work, Elise gets her boss's desk ready for her and as her boss, Celia Burrows (Rachel Quaintance), walks in, they go over the day's plans since the lead actor of a book-to-movie deal is going to be there for fans that won a competition. Elise is expected to cover all of the social media of the meet-and-greet. Celia then starts complaining about the new author they are publishing, but the author isn't writing according to schedule. Elise tries to pitch her book idea hoping that since the other author wasn't writing, she might have a chance. Celia reluctantly agrees to read it, but only because there aren't any other authors they are working with right now and she needs a new book deal. The lead of the hit teen book Moonlight Magic, Walker Paige (Sawyer Hartman), walks in and his fans scream. Elise and a coworker, Manda (Megan Duffy), are walking down a hallway talking about the meet-and-great when they stumble upon Celia and Walker making out in the stairway. Manda takes several pictures from around the corner before they both rush away. A while later, as Elise is uploading pictures from the meet-up, she accidentally uploads the pictures of Walker and Celia as well. Celia immediately fires Elise. Elise goes home crying and sees Jeff in the kitchen. She tells him about what happened while drinking one of the glasses of water he was getting at the time. He tries to cheer her up and suggests they go get drunk. He asks her to go and reserve a table a restaurant they often go to while he gets dressed. As she it about to leave, she realizes he had two glasses of water out when he only should have had one, implying that there was someone else in the apartment. Then, a girl walks out of the bedroom as she is reading the manuscript of Elise's book, criticizing it as she goes. Elise takes the manuscript, some vodka, and leaves to her apartment. At her apartment, Elise spends the night drinking vodka and looking at pictures of the \"beautiful\" girl Jeff was sleeping with. She then gets a notification from Sally that is a picture of Elise with two friends in Camp Takota T-shirts. For the rest of the night, she drunk-dials Sally multiple times saying she will be a camp counselor for the summer. The next morning, Elise is woken up by a car horn outside. Sally had gotten her voice messages and set it up for the Fefferman family to pick her up and take her to camp as they were also dropping off their daughter. The family continues to honk the horn outside, and Elise quickly gathers clothes, shoes, and toiletries in garbage bags and random paper bags before heading outside in both sweatpants and her business top and blazer from the day before. The mother, Kathy Fefferman (Amy Lindsay), has her husband, Bruce (Lee Schall), put Elise's things in the trunk and introduces her daughter, Penny (Kate Goldman). Kathy is very upbeat and excited to drop off Penny because her and Bruce will be going to Paris while Penny is at camp. Elise climbs in, and Kathy puts on French jazz music and continues to talk about her upcoming trip to Paris. Penny empathizes with Elise and gives her a Nintendo DS to keep her busy for the drive. Once they arrive at camp, Elise realizes that it is very empty, and Kathy tells her that she wanted to allow her daughter time to settle in before all of the other campers got there since she is only six. Maxine Reynolds (Mamrie Hart), Elise's old friend from camp then shows up, camp shirt, fanny pack and all, and greets Elise with a hug. She is so excited to see Elise and to hear that she will be staying the summer. Allison Henry (Hannah Hart), another old friend, also comes to greet Elise and tells her that she works as the chef in the Mess Hall. However, Allison is then pulled away by Kathy to go over Penny's dietary restrictions. Elise asks Maxine for a place to charge her cell phone, but is quickly informed that there isn't any cell service at camp anyway, and Maxine takes her phone. They both go to Elise's cabin, and on the walk there, Elise and Maxine talk about their lives since they last saw each other. It turns out that they both live in Chicago but never knew it. Maxine tells Elise that she wants to take over as camp director the next year when Sally retires. She also questions why Elise is there to begin with. Elise doesn't tell the entire truth and just says she got a book deal and wanted to get away from everything to have some peace and quiet to write. They joke around a little before Maxine leaves to allow Elise time to get settle in. Elise goes to sit by the lake and reminisce about the old camp days while writing in a journal. On the first day of camp, Sally and Maxine talk about all of the rules of camp and give a little introduction to the camp. Maxine raps the safety rules while some of the older girls dance behind her. After, Maxine gives the girls that helped her money, but gives the leader of the group, Sarah (Logan Riley Hassel), half since she didn't try as hard. Maxine also comments on the fact that Sarah snuck in cigarettes. Elise walks up, and Maxine gives her a huge binder to help her get back into the camp groove with lesson plans and camp songs. In the next few scenes, Elise is woken up by a loud trumpet. She is seen attempting to do various camp activities including squatting in bushes to pee, giving a craft lesson that goes wrong, teaching archery while the campers continuously point their arrows at her, hiking with campers, dyeing her hands while trying to dye camp shirts, getting soaked in a water balloon fight, fighting off mosquitos, and getting pommelled by dodge balls. She also confiscates cigarettes from the older girls before going to the kitchen to hide with Allison. The two of them talk a little before Allison tells Elise to grab the box of Fiber Nuts if she's ever having a rough day. It turns out that there is a bottle of wine in the box. Elise then asks about the guy in the truck she saw earlier, and Allison explains that his name is Eli Morton (Chris Riedell) and he brings fresh produce to the camp from his farm that is across the lake. Allison picks up on the fact that Elise likes him, but Elise quickly denies it and says this summer is, \"a welcome break from penis,\" and Allison replies with, \"Story of my life,\" implying that she's gay, and the two laugh about her stereotypical lesbian attire of a Chicago Bulls basketball jersey. Maxine is then heard calling for Elise to get back to work. Later on, Maxine asks Elise to check on Penny since she isn't at the Lady Gaga Ice Cream Social. Elise goes to Penny's cabin to see that Penny is playing on her DS, and Elise doesn't get mad but instead asks for the other. Penny isn't really sure about her time at camp and the two of them sort of bond over that fact. At night, Maxine tells campers of the Camp Takota Ghost. She says that the ghost is lured to fires and that Elise had even seen the ghost when she was a camper. The campers then go to sleep a little unsettled. The next morning, Elise is getting out of the shower and getting dressed when she panics about something she sees when putting on her underwear. She then calls Maxine and Allison over a walkie-talkie to help her. They both have a look and come to the conclusion that she has poison ivy all over her crotch from peeing in the bushes and offer various things to help it get better after laughing at her a little. Elise walks around the rest of the camp uncomfortably while the girls laugh at her as well. In the craft hut, Elise tries to get a group of rowdy girls to calm down and only ends up getting them to calm down when she says she's pregnant like she had with Jeff. They are going to be pressing flowers to make a bookmark. She asks if they brought books to press the flowers, and all of them take out Moonlight Magic. A girl from the office then come in, asks for role, and gives Elise several messages that Jeff left. The girls get ahold of the messages and start teasing Elise for having a \"boyfriend.\" Elise freaks out and snaps at them, and Maxine hears her while walking outside. Maxine pulls Elise out of class and lectures her to calm down, finish the class, and they would talk about why she was acting like this later. At a cabin-house a little way from the camp, Elise tells Maxine and Allison what happened and why she's there. Elise laughs at her horrible book idea about a boy who was a loch ness monster trying to keep it a secret from his girlfriend that happened to be a centaur. They are sympathetic and joke a little, and Maxine tells her that she should be whatever she wants to be and not let the world control who she is. Elise responds by saying, \"I just want to be me, but like a happy version.\" They all eat incredible food made by Allison and get drunk afterward. In the middle of the night, Elise tries to find a bottle opener in a drawer but accidentally stumbles upon an acceptance letter from the Chicago Chef's Institute for Allison. She quietly puts it back and goes back to the other girls where they all start singing the old song they made up when they were campers and try to remember how it went. Elise then asks Allison where the bottle opener is and goes to get it when Eli walks into and Elise freaks out. She breaks her bottle of beer as a weapon, not knowing what was going on. Maxine and Allison tell her to calm down, and Allison starts to pick up the glass but accidentally cuts herself. Maxine volunteers to bring her to the infirmary and Eli drives them. The next morning, Eli goes to wake up Elise, but Elise has peed her pants, so the two of them go to the laundry room to get her clothes cleaned, and Eli lets her borrow some clothes. They talk a little and Elise explains the reason she's here. He's sympathetic and tells her about his ex-wife and how he built the farm he now lives on with her, but she only wanted it as a place to sleep with his best friend. They laugh about their problems, and Eli tells her that she's kind of intimidating because she's so confident about everything even though she's a bit of a mess. He offers to row over to the camp if she ever wants to talk and suggests she flash a flashlight over the lake if she did. He leaves, and Maxine walks in. They talk about Eli, but Maxine tells her that she only came in there sit on the washer machine while it was spinning and watch the groundskeeper, Chet (Cameron Britton), while he works outside. Later, Sally's grandson, Jared (John Milhiser), drives up with his assistant, Kyle (Jason McNichols), and Maxine, Allison, and Elise listen in the kitchen as they explain the new camp they are planning for the next that will be a tech camp. Maxine confronts him, and it turns out that there isn't enough funding to keep Camp Takota alive, and Jared will be taking over the camp. As Maxine is leaving, Jared calls her back and shows her the ring finger, saying she isn't \"worth the middle finger.\" Maxine then goes to Sally, and Sally tells her that the only way for the camp to stay was if half of the camp for the next year was full from pre-registration. Not enough kids have been signing up in the past years, and the camp was going downhill with the new tech generation. Maxine promises to have enough campers register. Elise is distributing packages to campers beds and notices that Penny hasn't received any. She has the idea of writing letters and sending them herself as if they were from her parents. It is clear that Penny is very shy and hasn't made many friends. That night, Elise flashes her flashlight across the lake to get Eli's attention, and Eli rows over, but the two of them laugh about how long it takes him. The two of them talk, and Elise asks Eli to mail the letters she wrote for Penny. However, in the pile of letters is a note from Jeff. They talk a little bit a about him, and she comments on the fact that she often changes to suit her boyfriend, but he says she's great the way she is. Allison interrupts them to say Maxine wants to see them in the Mess Hall. Maxine explains the situation with the camp and how she wants to make sure the camp it still there the next year and Jared doesn't take over. She plans to make the camp as nice as it can by Visitors' Day when the parents come to see what their kids experienced at camp. For the rest of camp, the cabins are repaired, signs are repainted, and the camp is cleaned up. It is also seen that Penny gets the letters that Elise wrote, which makes her very happy, and the relationship between Eli and Elise continues to grow as they spend more time together. While Elise is teaching a craft lesson, Celia calls the camp, and Elise goes to answer the call in the office. Celia says that since the photo of Walker and her leaked, book sales skyrocketed, and she wants Elise to come back and oversee the memoir that Walker is writing. She also tells Elise that she read her manuscript and sees potential in it. However, Elise needs to be back the next morning if she wants her job back. Elise goes into the craft hut where Allison and Maxine are teaching some older girls. Maxine proceeds to ask Elise to do several tasks to make sure everything is okay for the night and the next day, which is Visitors' Day, and Elise quietly tells Maxine that she can't do those things because she will be leaving camp that night. Allison has the campers leave before returning to hear what Elise has to say. Elise tells them that she got her job back and needs to be in Chicago the next day. Maxine is furious and says the entire \"I just want to be me\" talk was BS. She also states that Elise is being extremely selfish for just leaving. Elise responds that Maxine herself was selfish for orchestrating the entire \"Save Camp Takota\" idea and expecting them to all follow it as well as for keeping Allison there when she got accepted to a culinary school in Chicago. She says that Allison is scared to leave because of what Maxine might say. Maxine leaves, and Allison stays to say that Elise had no right to make decisions on her behalf before leaving as well. Elise then gets her stuff together and gets her cell phone from the office, but it's dead. She asks Eli to borrow a phone to call a cab, but since the camp is so far out, it would take a while to get there to begin with. She tells him that she needs to leave and why, and Eli is crestfallen with the idea that what they had together and saving the camp wasn't real. He tells her to get her own ride and figure it out on her own. Elise has Chet drive her to the bus station instead. In the kitchen, Maxine and Allison talk about what Elise said about the culinary school. Allison says that she's not entirely sure what she wants and is afraid that she wouldn't like culinary school or wouldn't be good enough. Maxine encourages her to go because that is what will make her happy like Camp Takota makes Maxine happy. At the bus station, Elise spends the night on a bench, using her stuff as a pillow while thinks about everything that happened that summer. When she opens her purse, she finds a letter from Penny that says how thankful she is for having Elise there and for making camp fun for her. The last thing that is heard is the announcement that the Chicago bus was there and ready to leave. It's Visitors' Day, and all of the campers are having fun with their parents showing them what they have done all summer and the friends they have made. Sally is proud of what Maxine has done and hopes that everything will end up okay. Jared shows up and continues to insult Maxine and the camp. Maxine simply walks away, showing Jared her ring finger. Jared gets upset and says he's, \"worth the middle finger.\" At the introduction for the parents, Maxine, Allison, and Elise as well as some other campers were supposed to perform the song that the three wrote when they were campers, but Elise isn't there. However, Elise quickly slips in before they start. They all perform the song together, and Elise apologizes for just leaving like she did. That night, Maxine leads the closing campfire what will be the last for Camp Takota. Jared interrupts and tells the campers and parents about the Digital and Interactive Camp (D.I.C.) that Camp Takota will be turned into. Maxine tells them how Camp Takota was special to her and all of the memories she has from this place. She encourages the campers to not let Camp Takota go even if Jared takes over. On the side of the stage, Elise runs into Eli and apologizes for what she did the previous day. He accepts her apology and says he wants to continue their relationship. They are then interrupted when Allison tells Eli to go on stage as their guest storyteller since he is a writer. Elise is surprised that he is an author, an Allison justifies not telling her by saying she never outright lied. Eli tells the campers and their parents of the Camp Takota Ghost and how it is attracted to the campfire like the one they had that night. Rustling and twigs snapping is heard, and a dirty man steps out from the trees. It turns out to be Jeff, and Elise runs over to him to get him to leave. He is mad that she never returned his calls and is insistent that she has to give him a second chance. Eli steps in, and Elise almost says that he is her boyfriend, but stops herself quickly. Jeff is further angered and punches Eli. Eli fights back, and eventually Elise breaks them apart. She tells Jeff that their relationship was over and to go home. She then turns to Eli, tells him that she's incredibly turned on by what he just did, and kisses him while everyone watches and cheers. Maxine, Elise, and Allison spend the night drinking, and the next morning Maxine and Elise are still sleeping when Allison comes in and tells them to see the huge line outside the Mess Hall. It turns out that the \"ghost\" from last night reminded past campers (parents) how magical camp could be and that they didn't want Jared influencing their kids. The all of the campers themselves also want to come back the next year as well. Chet tell them that over sixty percent of the camp is registered and the camp was saved. Maxine jumps on Chet, kissing him, and then tells him to wait in the woodshed for her. Kathy Fefferman then thanks Elise for everything she did for Penny that summer, and Allison is pulled away when she sees Lindsey Johnson, a former camper that she used to make out with and pretend they were \"practicing.\" By the lake, Allison, Maxine, and Elise sit and talk about the future plans for Camp Takota. Maxine immediately fires Allison so she can go to the culinary school in the city and thanks them for everything they did for her that summer. In the end, it turns out that Allison does really well at culinary school, Maxine is able to enjoy her job as camp director, and Elise writes a book about the time she spent at camp and what she learned there while continuing her relationship with Eli.",

         "I thought it was a funny film, but that's mostly it. Yes, it's a good independent film, and it's amazing how far these youtube ladies have come in comparison to a few years ago. The setting is nice and it has a lot of 'youtube-ish' and good comedy. You can also somewhat relate to the characters, which are played really believable. But it isn't very special and doesn't contain much story-dept. Also the editing really annoyed me. With all the fades and black spaces every few minutes it felt like I was pulled back from the movie and back to the real world. It also has a few short scenes which I didn't thought were necessary. It just didn't really stand out for me. Overall I think it was a very funny and feel-good movie, but it doesn't had very much dept. The result was that it didn't remain in my thoughts afterwards. (I do have to add I was already known with their work before I saw this movie. This may have affected my expectations.)",
         "This movie doesn't deserve more than 6 stars. I might even be a little bit too nice. Although I really appreciate those internet personalities, the storyline wasn't great and most of it was predictable. Mamrie's acting was good (I think she's the most experienced one in that area), so was Grace's but Hannah's didn't convince me (sorry Harto. Boop Boop!). It's a good start, though. This is their first movie and you can see that they had fun making it. I really hope that the next one will be more entertaining as well as more elaborate and witty. That being said, if you want to spend a nice evening in front of a sweet movie, Camp Takota is the right fit as long as you don't expect to be blown away by the storyline and the puns.",
         "This film, despite having traditional, good old fashioned fun at it's very core, is hugely important in terms of indie films of the future. Not only does it rely on downloads for income, it's stars, Grace Helbig (Elise), Mamrie Hart (Maxine) and Hannah Hart (Allison) all spend most of their time being wonderfully funny and talented YouTube comedians. The way everything was produced, distributed, and made- from casting, to vlogging of it's production- marks an exciting future for film. This excitement is heightened when watching the picture itself. Elise, an aspiring writer, seems to have her future secured with to-be husband Jeff (Chester See, another YouTube sensation), spending all her spare minutes researching honeymoons in Paris. However, a rather awful afternoon flips her surface-perfect life upside down. Her old summer camp is the flip side that she finds herself in, after a drunken night on Facebook with her mobile and all the wrong- or right- numbers by her side. Upon arriving at camp, she finds herself being reunited with old friends Maxine and Allison, who don't seem to have moved from when she last saw them, when they were still lil' tater tots experiencing camp themselves. It is not just old friends that Elise collides with, though- a man in plaid with just the right amount of facial hair, named Eli (Chris Riedell), also happens to sail into her life, and sweetly, realistically awkward encounters ensue. Just when Elise begins to get comfortable (or uncomfortable, in one case) with nature, and settles in with the ways of the camp, the continuation of it's home-made, pinterest-style values are put on the balance, it's future uncertain. Can the dwindling fire of the camp be re-lit? Through trials and tribulations, the highs and low(e)s of friendship, shock phone-calls and sweaty-palmed romances, you find yourself at a satisfying conclusion to this question. With beautiful cinematography, a pastel-filled colour palette and quirky, playful, mise-en-scene, the film is a visual treat. The screenplay, written by Lydia Genner and Mamrie Hart, provides belly laughs and truly tear-jerking moments. The execution and deliverance of the script is of extreme quality, especially considering it's stars have never appeared in any full length feature films before, with Hannah Hart never having acted before in her life. Mamrie Hart's presence on screen is undeniable; a natural performer, her comedic timing utterly perfect. Warm, charismatic and charming, Hannah Hart offers to the film a performance so rich and sweet that it's slightly impossible not to fall in love with her and her tank-top-bandanna outfit combination. Grace Helbig shows true potential as an actress, her ability to captivate the audience effortless and natural. She has no trouble at all in leading the film, her balance of incorporating subtle character traits, raw emotion, and flowing humour proving to be finely tuned. All of the supporting actors, including the children, give just as fantastic performances, each adding their own wonderful twist to the tale of Camp Takota. Promoting friendship, sticking to what you believe in, and trusting yourself, this production will make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside- with just the right mix of jokes, development of character arcs and relationships, and enhancement of a beautiful setting, Takota is a very worthwhile watch.",
         "So, this is a movie that is only doing well because people enjoy the Youtubers associated with it. Grace Helbig is an okay actress, believable, and probably better than I expected and absolutely the best in the movie. The plot was silly, and how she reacted to a cheating fiancé was nothing short of ridiculous, but that is the fault of poor writing. The acting was \"okay\", no one was embarrassingly bad besides the boss in the beginning of the movie. I assume she was told to act like a more mild version of Miranda Priestly from \"The Devil Wears Prada\", which means it just looked like an absolutely horrible performance. If the thought comes to anyone's mind to act like Meryl Streep, don't, because you will fall on your face. In short: This movie has alright acting, a silly plot, and very poor writing.",
         "Even though the movie is a low budget film, it is incredibly entertaining. Camp takota is a good movie to watch with anyone. Grace helbig, Hannah hart, and mamrie hart did an outstanding job. I sure did learn something from the film. Even my 12 year old brother liked the movie. I don't regret buying this movie it was worth it. I just wished that they'd get more into Allison's (Hannah) life. But other than that it was awesome. Hopefully there's camp takota 2 or some new movie by these 3 wonderful and inspirational women. Its just weird seeing them act so serious and even fight because not only they're best friends I'm real life and I cannot possibly see them fight but also I spend my days watching them being goof balls and charming in they're YouTube channels so this movie was oddly refreshing :)",
         "I would advise people to look carefully at the reviews, and make sure that they are not being made by members of cast and crew. I follow Grace religiously, because she is beautiful, and talented, and a fairly good actress, and that is the only person that you really care about in this movie, other than the nerdy little girl in glasses, who is never mentioned in the end game. Huge mistake. A better structured movie would have told the story from HER point of view, as a little girl, and through the years. Everybody else in this movie is a cliché, and I blame Mamrie Hart for that. Everybody worships the \"holy trinity of Youtube;\" but why? Because it is a cult of personality that both Mamrie and Hannah cater to. Grace doesn't have to. She is the Beyoncé of the group. Overall, this is actually a pretty bad movie. Two stars out of five.",
         "I don't think this movie was worth a watch at all. I was really bored so just put on this movie and ended up being more bored. I didn't like the cast so much either. The movie was not touching and was not interesting at all. The whole romance thing also lacked chemistry. It felt very bland. It also didn't have much humour and didn't feel funny where it was supposed to be. It was like predictable and nothing very much that'll blow you away. I don't know why it has above 7 ratings here, but i'm sure once the user review start coming in it'll drop. It felt like a very typical kind of movie and wasn't anything new that would amaze people.",
         "This movie is just terrible as well as the acting at times you could really tell these people were trying way to hard to sound and come across as actors. I would say avoid this movie and ignore the biased reviews from youtube fans of these people and take it from someone who has no hidden agenda other than to warn people off of terrible movies and people who really should just stick to making youtube videos and at least try not to act. i am giving this a low rating as i have watched this and really struggled to go past a certain point in the movie before i decided enough is enough of the bad acting by all of the actors/actresses",
         "At the time of writing, this film had an 8.4 on IMDb and mostly 5 star reviews on Letterboxd. I had been waiting for this to come out for months, but I'd been a little sceptical that all these high ratings were just because this is Grace, Mamrie and Hannah's movie. Camp Takota has a very simple and lighthearted storyline with some great jokes and some pretty solid acting from its extremely likable cast. Yes, this was shot on a minuscule budget and had its share of problems regarding distribution but it's beautifully shot and there are some incredibly emotional scenes that I really did not expect. It's obvious that everyone involved in making Takota has a blast doing so and it really does translate onto the screen. It's a fun ride with some very admirable performances.",
         "This is a cute TV-grade movie about an unestablished young -- but not-that-young-anymore -- woman who escapes her dysfunctional life to work as a counselor at a summer camp, although she's just a leeeeetle bit too old for that. \"TV-grade\" meaning that the actors can't really act and that the script is as predictable and boring as ... well, an underdeveloped and underdramatised TV movie. When comely but still totally down-to-earth Elise (Grace Helbig) arrives back at Camp Takota, it quickly transpires that her camp counselor colleagues from back in the day are actually lesbians. That's why they always bunked together, geddit? Elise discovers the charms of simple camping life along with the rugged charms of local hunk Jeff who's an alternative farmer. Will Elise return to her busy city life or ... I'll stop here because I don't want to give away the ending. I don't want to be overly sarky, this is an OK little movie but unquestionably a looooong way from being 7.5/10 impressive, as the current IMDb ranking would have it. Running a successful Youtube channel and being a successful movie actress are two different pairs of shoes after all.",
         "Camp Takota proves that the Holy Trinity of YouTube (Grace Helbig, Mamrie Hart, and Hannah Hart) can successfully deliver a humorous and touching film. The three leading ladies were awesome in their roles, with Mamrie and her character standing out the most (for me). Grace's somewhat dry sense of humor contributed to the hilarity of her jokes and quips. I was really impressed with Hannah in this film too, never having seen her act before. Fans of the three comediennes won't be disappointed, nor will those who have never seen them before. This is an all around touching film that will leave the viewer with a pleasant feeling afterward.",
         "This movie, is terrible. It's like a Lifetime movie but with swearing. My wife only likes movies with happy endings, and even though this movie has a happy ending, it's such sugary fluffy garbage it is PAINFUL to watch, and even she couldn't take it. The film doesn't execute anything positive successfully. The characters don't captivate, aren't believable and it's so very campy. The movie has a few lines of witty dialogue worth a laugh, but the story is predictable and puts the cheese in cheesy. It's literally a waste of 100 minutes of your life. Whoever wrote anything positive about this movie, must have been connected to it in some way or was paid. I watched it, all of it, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.",
         "The film is a masterpiece that contains nothing less than the three most beautiful and talented women of all time. Please buy this film and spread the word! The ultimate feel- good film with a beautiful twist at the end... The story, music and setting for this film all come together to create a film which I look forward to coming back to again and again. The characters are played magnificently, and all seem to (somehow) reflect their Youtube personalities. The added touches and inside jokes all come together to form this timeless sensation that is a joy for everyone to watch, and perfect for everyone, whether you are a Holy Trinity fan or not. I recommend that you see this film, though maybe watch it once through before showing it to younger children due to sex references and occasional swearing. PLEASE go and buy this film!",
         "It's great to see the three YouTube stars doing a film together. I'm not their subscriber, so I don't them. But YouTube is my one of the major social network to hangout. As many reviewers said, it was an average film. Might be rated high by the fanboys. Though it could have been even worse. The same old, same old plot. Below par acting skills. The film particularly aimed for late 20s and early 30s people. The rest of the guys from different generation would find is unfunny. A young woman who recently lost her job, as well as broke up with her boyfriend, heads to her childhood summer camp to become a staff member where her two old friends already been serving. Time to recover from all the recent disaster stricken life, she's unable to cope and things take unusual turns to make events more complicated. The remaining story is to tell how she manages around. For such a B movie, it is an acceptable. But beware of predictable storyline. The lines should have been very motivated, especially towards the end. There's no twist, if you already know it's coming and what it is. Too many adult jokes, otherwise the film would have attracted the youngsters, like teens and kids. Simply one time watchable film. Or you can find similar other great flicks out there. 5/10",
         "All the big Youtubers have been raving about this movie when this came out, and naturally, I assumed that these Youtubers are only supporting their peers that's why they're saying nice things about the movie. The story was pretty mediocre, it has a simple plot that we've all seen before. However, even if that's the case, I still found myself enjoying the movie. For a low budget project, the filming was great. The production did a great job at making a good film out of limited/tight resources. The actors did a great job too, considering that some of them have never acted for a movie before. The emotional scenes didn't feel awkward to me considering the fact that I am so used to seeing Grace, Mamrie and Hannah being comedic and always goofing off. Of course, there were witty comedy and classic puns. You can't really have the Holy Trinity of Youtube in a movie without throwing in some puns, it's what they are known for. Over all it was an enjoyable movie. It wasn't award worthy but I think they made a pretty decent job at this project. And I'm not just saying this because I'm a fan of their channels. In all honesty, this was really well made.",
         "Overall I had a very satisfying experience watching this film, and was able to look past some obvious flaws to enjoy it. I just can't be the only one who thinks that the plot was overplayed. It wasn't just the recycled storyline that got to me, because it really could have worked, what got to me was how much of it fell flat. Maybe I expected more from the fantastic Mamrie and friends? There were so many things about this movie that worked amazingly well. It had boatloads of charm and humor. Mamrie, Hannah and Grace had obvious chemistry (of course). I just feel they should have included more of what worked, and less of what didn't, e.g., the romance. I don't think the romance worked well at all. It was too obvious and lacked any real chemistry. I got more out of watching Maxine and Chet than I did from Elise and Eli. I think they just used the romance as a crutch, when they didn't even need one at all, they had so many other things working for them. They should have focused more on the camp, the friendship, and the comedy. Those were the things that worked fantastically, and for me, made up for the second-hand storyline. On my first viewing I noticed the things that made me cringe, but they were more than made up for by the few perfect moments. It was the second viewing however, that got me bummed. There were so many great things about it, and it had the potential to not just be the okay feel- good movie it was. It could have been a true gem. Maybe a sequel will be?",
         "I'm subscribed to many YouTubers on YouTube and when I heard about 'Camp Takota' I was curious on what this was. I thought it was some type of project that would go completely wrong. I thought maybe this was a project happening that will either be forgettable, unreleased or just go horribly wrong. It's a film starring famous YouTubers Grace Helbig (dailygrace), Hannah Hart (myharto) and Mamrie Hart (youdeserveadrink). This movie is a great movie, especially since it's a first for these YouTubers. The acting was great overall but had some minor flaws sometimes but you will probably not notice them. When I saw the main characters act, I looked past their YouTuber status and the people I saw on YouTube and saw them as the characters they were portraying rather than \"Hey, look at this YouTuber,\" Al though, I feel like the characters are just exaggerated versions of the YouTubers, but they were all great anyways. This film has really funny, smart and great dialogue. Some of the jokes are hard to miss if you don't pay attention for one second, but this movie is very funny overall. The dialogue during the dramatic moments were very realistic and I actually cared about these characters and wanted them all to be all right. If you're feeling sad or feeling a little bit under-the-weather, I definitely recommend this film. It is really a heart-warming and a cozy film. This film also has pretty decent cinematography, I felt that I was in a different country sometimes. This movie is great overall, especially since (I'm assuming) these YouTubers have only acted in this movie. It's a great acting/writing debut for all of them. 7/10",

         "Three of my all time favourite YouTubers in a single film that sums up how important independent cinema can be! Follows a typical linear narrative, and uses a lot of cliché material at times, but done in such an acceptable and hilarious way which can only be understood and tolerated if you're a fan of their work, and after following each of their journeys on YouTube over the last several years, its very clear to see their creative input in the film, and how well its been used; but this is all good, good stuff! Possibly open for a sequel, but id prefer to see their work implemented in other, similar comedy styles! Well done for all your hard work ladies, I know how hard making a film can be! :D",
         "In addition to today being the premiere of season 2 of House of Cards it was also the premiere of the movie Camp Takota (2014). I felt split between which of the two to watch first but I ended up going with Camp Takota and I'm glad I did. Camp Takota is a movie made by YouTube's Holy Trinity, Grace Helbig, Hannah Hart, and Mamrie Hart. I have to admit that these three were the sole reason I wanted to the see Camp Takota and I honestly didn't expect the movie to be more than just acceptable. I was wrong. Camp Takota is a good, solid movie; and more than that, it is a movie that doesn't feel like most other movies. The specialness of the movie lies in the details and the way an otherwise ordinary tale is told. Camp Takota radiates both endearing familiarity as well as a delightful special Camp Takota charm which comes together and takes the movie from good to great. I, for one, am completely surprised by Camp Takota. My low hopes got put to shame by what turned out to be a great movie. Definitely a movie I can recommend, especially if you like the humor of either of Grace Helbig, Hannah Hart, or Mamrie Hart on YouTube.",
         "Not only am I HUGE fan of Grace Helbig for she is one of my most favorite you tubers, I now a even HUGER (is that even word?) for CAMP TAKOTA !! I loved it so much even more than I thought I would. I could not be more proud for Grace Helbig, Hannah Hart, and Mamrie Hart for achieving this wonderful movie but to my surprise they are extremely great actors as well as you tubers. I cant get enough for all the other actors such as Chester See and Chris Riedell for putting up such an amazing plot ! (Especially that fight/kissing scene... ) You won't regret watching this movie. Its CAMPTASTIC. k that was weird. just watch it.",
         "This film is so thoroughly enjoyable, that I am of the opinion you should just stop reading this review right now and go watch it. Go. Now. ... needing specifics? All right then. Beautifully written, this film will make you laugh, sigh and feel all the feelings without once letting you down. The story is adorable and relatable and everything down to the last detail is thoroughly thought out and impeccably crafted. Hollywood wishes it could produce something this refreshing. Grace, Mamrie and Hannah bring it to the big screen (well, you know what I mean) in a way that will surely have Tina and Amy watching their backs! Their performances are everything you were gleefully anticipating and more. If you're a YouTuber from way back, you will be thrilled. If you are new and being compelled to watch by a manic friend, you will be hooked. It's important to note that the friendship of this trio, as well as the love felt on the set by everyone down to the tiniest camper, comes through in a beautiful and genuine way in this movie. You know a labor of love when you watch it. It warmed my heart and made me grin from ear to ear even when I was also crying. I cannot wait to see what they do next.",
         "This film does not have a rating for some reason. I would give it a PG-13 rating, going borderline R rating. I have followed these 3 talented women (Mamrie Hart, Grace Helbig and Hannah Hart) on YouTube for a while now and I have to say \"Camp Takpta\" is everything it was expected to be. This film is new, fresh and vibrant. A good length, roughly an hour and forty-five minutes. Got straight to the point. Definitely some funny moments, some serious moments, and romantic moments. Also definite room for a sequel if they make enough money. This is a classic regular-Saturday-sit- down-and-relax film. Wonderful job all around. Motivates all up and coming film directors. Would recommend this film to anyone in the 16+ age range. General good acting from the main cast. Hannah Hart definitely fit right in with her supporting role.",
         "6/10 +2 stars for being progressive It's a feel good movie about finding love at camp. Which cling a bit Disney teen movie. What you get is a really progressive movie. It's a heart warming comedy, a bitter-sweet storytold through believable dialogue, which contain massages with surprising depth for this genre. It manages to achieve the feel-good wibe with a sweet massage without losing to much realness or depth and I admire that. The movies most striking characteristic is the mixture of realness and over the top exactly what you would expect to happen but times two. Conventional storyline, told in an unconventional way. As quite the social justice tumblr activist I have trouble finding comedies that I enjoy, with out feeling like it's a guilty pleasure, but I really liked this one. It earned two extra star because it did so many things right. In many areas and in ways you wouldn't expect. There were segments I didn't enjoy, some of the storyline and the editing (like the opening scene). The movie is a bit like a rough diamond, some polishing wouldn't hurt, but it's still a freaking diamond. This is the kind of movie you can watch at a movie night and be sure that it puts everyone in a good mood.",
         "I absolutely loved it! Couldn't ask for more in a funny, lighthearted film with a lot of love and laughs. Really reasonable price to buy from their website Camptakota.com or now on Itunes! You get a lot of extra bonus footage. If you want more like this then you should definitely subscribe to 'Mametown-Mamrie Hart','its grace- Grace Helbig' and'harto-Hannah Hart'on youtube. I was surprised (but in a good way) - to see the romantic side of this script, and the actors/actresses involved in this sub-plot were really natural and convincing. In fact considering a lot of the younger campers looked VERY young, their acting was pretty good (adorable) and didn't trip you up as a viewer. Mamrie, Hannah and Grace are amazing together and should DEFINITELY act/write more films together! I'd buy them!"
