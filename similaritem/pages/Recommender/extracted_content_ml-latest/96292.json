         "A woman's marriage to a wealthy landowner is threatened when her childhood sweetheart, now a famous musician, returns after a long absence. Loosely based on Theodor Storm's novella, this melodrama was set in rural North Germany. Directed by the notorious `Jud Süß'- director Veit Harlan and featuring his wife Kristina Söderbaum in the female lead, this film offers some stunning colour photography.",
         "I have only seen this movie once, years ago, but since then I have been watching out for it to be shown again on television, because I think it's one of Germany's best dramas ever made. The characters are so emotional and the portrayal of their feelings is so refined, this picture is surely ripe for a revival. I even think it's better than Storm's novel itself!",
         "I went to see this at the cinema in Vienna, fully expecting to hate it...after all it was directed by one of cinematic history's all-time villains, Veit Harlan, who directed the notoriously antisemitic drama Jud Suss. And yet...I found myself drawn into the story in spite of myself, and in spite of the fact that Kristina Soderbaum (Harlan's wife) lacks charisma, a charge which can't be laid at the door of her co-star, Carl Raddatz, who is one of those ugly-but-sexy men, and has a distinct screen presence. The reason? The film is so poetic, so haunting, that even though its melodramatic tale is much-ado-about-nothing in some ways, it burrows beneath your defences. It is' at times beautiful to look at, and the score is often overpoweringly evocative. Proof that in artistic terms at least, even villains are not necessarily two-dimensional.",
         "Immensee is based on a novella by Theodore Storm. The propaganda ministry took advantage of the fact to promote self sacrifice. Christine Soderbaum portrays Elizabeth who lives on the estate of Immensee with her mother ,played by Carolla Toelle, she has no desire to ever leave it. With her next door neighbors Eric, played by Paul Klinger, with his sick ,on the wheel chair father,portrayed by Otto Gebuhr, known for his Fredrick the great impersonations, appearing for the first time in a color film.Reinhart , portrayed by Carl Radatz , is a music students who is training to be a symphony conductor and composes his music, is on a holiday and staying with his parents, portrayed by Lina Lossen , who played the prison maiden in to the New shore, and Max Gulstorf as his father.Rein And Liz are in love with each other. They see each other every day, but Rein is wild and likes to go to new places meet different people while Liz wants to stay at Immensee forever. This is the conflict in this film,she wants him to settle down at Immensee and marry her and he want her to go with him around the world. Then there's the neighbor Eric , he too is in love with Liz but but is too shy to let his feelings be known. Otto Gerbuhr character is a stoic who accepts that death is coming to him. I think this was a propaganda message to the German audience to except the death of their love ones fighting for Adolph. Well He promises her that he will come back on his birthday as he goes back to the music conservatory. The next day that he leaves she misses him. Her mother tries to discourage her from him cause he's not a settle down type. She encourages Eric to take more interest in her. His birthday comes and his fellow music students students surprise him at 12 midnight at his dorm with a party. He had written a song about his girl friend Liz and the students surprises him out of his bed with a party and they sing the song with Jesta, played by Kathe Dykhoff, his second girl friend, on the lead with the chorus of students. The party headed by , I hope I'm not wrong about this., music student friend, played by Wilfried Seyferth. Character German actor stalwarts, Clemens Hasse and Maltie Yeger , they're first appearance in a color film, show up as students too. As Rein goes into his bed room to get his robe on , Wilf notices this red book and he open it up it's songs he had written about his girl friend Liz. He and the students start reading it and choose one song and start to sing it. Rein comes out of his room and sees Jesta with his book he chases after her to get it while the music students watch.He does come back to Immensee but when he has to leave and this time for more years, He ask Liz to come with him when she takes him back to the train but she turns him down.

         "This film has not aged well. It's a melodrama with capital M, and the director isn't ashamed of using everything in his arsenal not to let us forget that. The acting is pregnant with tears, the dialog is highly noble without ever being more than superfluous, and everything is through-scored with an academic, predictable, serious and dignified symphonic score, which flows over the spectators like syrup over flies. The film might work, if the protagonists were more sympathetic. They are, however, not: Karl Raddatz is incredibly ugly, even though he is supposed to be the handsome hero. Kristina Söderbaum only has one or two emotions to display, and to be quite honest, being a healthy woman who looks as gentle as a pork pie, she really shouldn't have been cast in all these over-suffering roles. But then, her husband knew better. The colour photography is very good, and some of the cast - like pretty Käthe Dyckhoff who enjoyed a brief career during the war - are likable."
