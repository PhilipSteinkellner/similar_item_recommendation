In addition to the giraffe hunt, the film shows other aspects of !Kung life at that time, including family relationships, socializing and storytelling, and the hard work of gathering plant foods and hunting for small game.",

Pollution, eating species into extinction and massacre of environment happens on global scale: sacred and very needed by life on Earth trees are being massacred by human predator. Gold mining, illegal tree cutting, illegal ranching in Amazon already destroyed a lot of sacred trees. Animals' habitat is disappearing with exponential (unbounded) rate. Films: \"AMAZON with Bruce Perry\", \"The End of the Line (2009)\". Most vicious predator (human) must learn to stop destroying its own environment. While most vicious predator propagates with exponential (unbounded) rate, the nature and animals disappear with exponential rate at the hand of most vicious predator. Most vicious predator must stop unbounded (exponential) reproduction: it leaves no space for healthy environment for most vicious predator and leaves no space for animals. CONSUMPTION is not \"cool\" anymore. But we could forgive the makers of this movie because at the time of its production (1962) we did not know what we know today. The movie serves a good example of how the world can change in only a few decades. But that's what few decades allow to happen: for human predator to multiply exponentially (at unreasonably colossal rate) and the rest of animals and nature to disappear with exponential rate. Welcome to SIXTH Extinction!"],
