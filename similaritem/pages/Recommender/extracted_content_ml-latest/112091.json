         "This movie has a 6.4 rating as of May 2014 which is slightly too low I think. I give it a 7.5 out of 10. I have noticed that thrillers, unless they are great thrillers like The Usual Suspects etc.. are scored very low because of two reasons. Firstly thrillers are general slow paced at first and build suspense and tension. Some people lose interest quickly. Secondly, some people just don't get it. Due to the audience not following the dynamics of the thriller they score it low. The title Anna is a better title than Mindscape in my opinion because the story is a personal story about the character Anna and the main character's memory of his past love also named Anna. The main concept of Anna is not original and there are little things in the movies that require you to suspend belief etc etc etc...like all movies it is not perfect...but I really enjoyed the movie..I think the acting was great from Mark Strong and the support cast..I didn't know that the young girl, played by Taissa Farmiga, is the younger sister of Vera Farmiga. She is excellent. I think the story was predictable and I would have done something slightly different to make it less predictable but I can't explain further without spoiling. Having said that I still really enjoyed the movie. It is much better than most thrillers out there, some with much bigger budgets. Some reviewers have posted on the message board that they didn't like the details..I loved the details, this is what elevates the movie above most..it may not always be believable but Hey! we are watching a movie about a guy who can enter peoples memories, what was everyone expecting... It is a really interesting thriller that is well acted and despite being predictable it has a very clever plot versus underlying plot script...I recommend it above the majority of thrillers out there....great work!",
         "Again: Many spoilers ahead. At first, I kind of liked this movie - the two lead characters are well played, and so is their relationship as it develops through the meandering memories and the developments in the supposedly real world. It's adequately somber. The twists towards the end were a bit obvious in my opinion - of course she was luring him to the house and setting him up, and of course these were his memories, with the distant guy watching in precisely the way the main character explains at the beginning. Unfortunately, once you start to think about the plot, it falls apart. He's a detective, yet he doesn't really look at any of the clues he has taken home (e.g., the yearbook) in any depth until after the case is practically closed. Nice evidence board decoration he had on the wall - he should have perhaps drawn one up for this case too. And when called, he does this oh so old stupid movie mistake of rushing in without telling anybody. When will movie writers finally stop using that? Her side is even worse. There were signs of her interacting with the outside world, e.g., her drawing of stairs where he believes to have seen her. Was she able to occasionally escape? Apart from that, nothing of her whole back-story was explained; did she or did she not commit any crimes? Had she just been at the wrong place in the wrong time? How much was fabricated by her, how much was honest? What was with that \"Mousey\" confusion? Who was lying about what now? And finally: If she wanted to be assumed dead to get away from her parents, didn't sending the picture refute that purpose entirely? What is she living on now anyway? If running away was all she wanted, she evidently didn't need this convoluted plan to do so. When our main guy arrived at the house, the doors were already wide open. I guess you can explain some of those aspects away with \"those were just his memories of her memories\", but frankly, I think that's just an excuse for a script which was too obsessed with its twists.",
         "The plot of Anna is a lot like the movie Inception or Dreamscape. So, in that sense, the basic story idea isn't 100% original. It's set in the near future where there are apparently investigators called remote viewers or memory detectives who are much like psychotherapists who can actually enter the memories of people to determine what has happened. This can be useful in a therapeutic sense but can also be used to determine someone's guilt or innocence. John (Mark Strong) is one of these folks who can enter folks' memories and this is made more difficult due to some of his own troubling memories. John's latest case is Anna (Taissa Farmiga)ÔøΩa teenager who is unusually bright and perceptiveÔøΩbut who also might just be a sociopath. However, in viewing Anna's memories, John feels for the girl and thinks that perhaps folks are conspiring to have her committed to an institution when she is quite sane. Why? She's an heiress and her step-father might be setting her up to steal her fortune. But, through the course of the film it becomes more and more difficult for John to trust all the memories of Anna's that he's seenÔøΩand she might have some sort of strange hidden agenda. What's REALLY going on? And, by the end of the film, this might STILL be a question you are asking yourself. This is a movie you best watch while you are 100% percent focused. The ending, in particular, is confusing and might benefit from repeated viewing. I did this and understood what the filmmakers were trying to doÔøΩbut also noticed some plot problems at the same time. In particular, the film hinges on a panicked phone call John gets late at night from Anna. It sounds like someone is being killed! John does NOT phone the police. He does NOT take along anyone as a witness and he just blindly walks into what turns out to be a trap. Yet, at the same time, he's supposed to be a very smart and competent man! If you can ignore this serious confound, the film is pretty exciting as well as very well acted. Strong, in particular, is really good in the lead, as is Farmiga. In fact, the acting is the best aspect of the film. Despite these being relatively unknown names, the actors did a really fine job. The music also was quite fitting and tense. If only the film's plot problem near the end was cleaned up a bit, I would have given it a higher score. But what good is a mystery-suspense film when there is such an obvious plot problem? The film is interesting and worth seeing but not exactly a must-see for me.",
         "I like the idea of reading one memories. Although an old concept from cinematic point of view, I have always found a memory reader interesting, because memories are not a recollection of events. It is an interpretation. Hence, the concept of a memory reader is a trickier than one would expect. Most of the films and TV shows get this concept completely wrong. Anna was different. It actually showed how memories are interpretations of past events. The psychiatrist in a bid to find out the deep rooted issues of the teenage girl realizes how her memory cannot be completely trusted to figure out time-line of events that made her psychologically disturbed. The movie was extremely engaging till the climax ruined it all. I would try not to give away any spoilers but all I can say is the ending is utterly insipid, lack-lustrous and a total spoilsport to what could have been an inspiring psychological thriller. It seems as if the director Jorge Dorado did not wish to provide a twist in the end but did it just for the sake of giving one! What a sad sad way to make a disaster! Do not waste time on this movie. Period. Exclamation mark.",
         "Based on the reviews of this movie that I read on this site, I went into this film with high hopes. 90 minutes later,I was truly perplexed as to what all the buzz was about. Maybe films today are so bad that even \"average\" rates as \"very good\"? Well, I don't know, and while the film was not a total waste of time, it had little to offer,and was not as half as interesting as the reviews had lead me to believe it would be. The good: The beginning of the movie is very well set up: the movie takes place in the not too distant future where there are people who have the ability to recover and view the memories of others. The protagonist of the movie is a broken down memory reader in need of money and so he goes back to his old employer in search of a job.He is given a \"simple\" assignment: get a very precocious teenager to eat. But said teenager is *very* smart and not what she appears to be... Both the male lead (the returning memory recovery expert) and female lead (\"Anna\",the teenager) are played very well. The bad: Very convoluted plot, which devised to make the movie intriguing,in the end was a little over the top and maybe too clever for its own good. The ugly: The ending. Much ado about nothing. I was surprised that after all the complex twists and turns in the move it all came down to (what was in my opinion) an ending that is simple but unfortunately didn't really make much sense.",
         "First let's get the whole \"dynasty\" issue out of the way. These days in Hollywood, more care and attention is spent launching the careers of offspring/sibling than at any other point in film history. For example, in other reviews, I commented negatively on Will Smith's courageous attempts to turn his son into the next de Niro. Not going to happen, sorry Will.. This is a different story. Taissa Farmiga has got spark, she's got grit, she's got glow. This is a dynasty that just might find some traction. Next let's talk about the science because most people won't even know there actually is science. The original title of the film was Mindscape which was borrowed/stolen from the scientific work of the same name by Dr.'s Targ and Puthoff, based on their work done at SRI in the 80s. Using double-blind protocols, their work established for the first time the scientific validity of the RV phenomenon, even though the media mocked them for years afterwards. In other words, the science for this film is not necessarily from Crazytown. That's helpful to know. As for the film itself, it is surprisingly engaging given its very strange pedigree. Directed by a Spanish director, the film has not one but three major British talents --- Mark Strong, Brian Cox and Indira Varma-- all going \"accentless\" just for this production. Overall, this film is also unusual in that it faithfully demonstrates the stoic and disciplined direction one generally associates with British TV drama -- although clearly intended for US audiences. The above comment is actually not a criticism at all, but (to be fair) US viewers may find the pacing slow. It isn't. It is just very, very, controlled. Mark Strong's character is the \"glue\" that keeps the film together This requires him to be simpatico with the audience, and he is. Ironically, the actual script requires Strong's character to \"have trouble staying grounded\" (quote), yet it is precisely Strong's ability to ground the film that keeps it flowing. As for the story itself, to go into detail would likely spoil it. I would really really like to tell you that the theme behind it is new but it simply isn't. (If you are a curious cinephile, look up the 2003 production LIFE OF David GALE.) Bottom line: good clean fun. But what this film will be remembered for is young Farmiga.",
         "Mark Strong has a loyal cult following, and I can get on board with that. He's interesting to watch. But this film isn't worthy of its leads. The story isn't clever enough, and the movie relies too heavily on clich√©s to create atmosphere. Rather than casting a Brit in the role of Anna, the British actors (Strong, Brian Cox, Indira Varma, Richard Dillane and Saskia Reeves) all accommodate newcomer Taissa Farmiga by adopting faux American accents. The whole film, complete with blue filters and a couple of outdoor shots of some American Metropolis with no name (it's filmed in Spain), is a kind of inauthentic American thriller. The premise is clunky, requiring some awkward exposition from the outset. This must be some time in the future, because detectives can read minds now. Strong's \"John,\" (no last name), while recovering from a personal tragedy which is interfering with his work, is assigned to \"Anna\" (also no last name), a teenager with an eating disorder. Even the names in this movie are generic. In a plot device shamelessly lifted from \"Inception,\" the film that \"Anna\" desperately wants to be, John's wife loses a child and uses her husband's gifts to live in her memories, ultimately unable to escape her virtual reality. We never meet her. Anna's messed-up parents never really get their comeuppance, which is unsatisfying. In her home, she's monitored by a nurse, Judith (Varma), through a camera installed in her bedroom. I've never heard of such a thing happening in real life. The nurse hits it off with John instantly, although there's zero chemistry on camera, and after a perfunctory date in a depressing bar, John politely declines an invitation to \"come upstairs\" within 24 hours of meeting her. These people are all very unprofessional. When the nurse is thrown down the stairs, purportedly by Anna (we never actually find out whether she did this or any of the other horrible things she's been accused of), John goes to the hospital and clutches Judith's hand as though she's the love of his life. She spends about 5 minutes on screen throughout the whole film. Cox is similarly underused. Accused of serious misconduct which later proves to be groundless, we're never really sure what to make of him, and ultimately it's not pertinent to the plot anyway. The film requires serious suspension of disbelief. For an empathic detective, John is bafflingly obtuse. He treats a young girl (with a history of sexual abuse by an older teacher) in her bedroom, of all places. The treatment requires them to hold hands. Anna flirts brazenly with him from day one, but a few mumbled comments about transference notwithstanding, he never distances himself from her. She sketches him, watches him sleep, and at the end of their treatment, she hugs him, as does her mother. In real life, a psychiatrist/mindreading-detective would be like \"WHOA!\" In fact, it's not clear why John is allowed to \"treat\" a vulnerable child with obvious mental and behavioural issues, let alone administer sedatives prescribed for her mother. He's a detective, not a psychiatrist. Who gives children sedatives after a trauma anyway, outside of an intensive car unit? And how is this new, unproven method of entering a person's mind and witnessing their memories deemed appropriate for an unbalanced juvenile? And how does it actually work? However it works, Anna seems to be more cunning than everyone else in this film, which beggars belief. John makes so many obvious missteps you wonder if he's ever seen a movie before. I felt like yelling at him, like you do in pantomimes. \"Don't go into the woods!\" I'm still not clear on what Anna actually did and what she didn't do. The twist towards the end neatly resolves all of the outstanding plot holes, in the same way that finding out the whole movie has been a dream is a resolution. It was profoundly unsatisfying. John, released from the pain that's been haunting him for years, celebrates his new-found freedom by \"going upstairs\" with the nurse we forgot existed. It's almost identical to the ending of the underwhelming \"Blood,\" in which he also plays a detective, also with Brian Cox. None of the characters in this film are developed in a way that makes them relatable, and you never invest emotionally in them. Anna herself is cold and robotic rather than engaging and seductive, and despite Strong's tangible talent, and a lot of superfluous smouldering, we never really get a handle on his character. He's just a cardboard cut-out of an American detective with personal issues. Maybe if we'd seen more of his relationship with his wife, instead of just a glimpse of blurry memories and a photo that could have been clipped from a catalog. The nurse was more of a plot device than a person, so we never get to see John engage with anyone on a human level. Strong and Cox are actors of substance, and it's a pity to see them wasted on an underdeveloped story. Farmiga isn't bad, but she's too young and inexperienced to carry a film. I'm not sure who they're pitching this to: savvy \"Inception\" fans, or the teen-girls who might have watched \"The Bling Ring.\" I doubt it will satisfy either audience. Why they changed the name \"Mindscape\" to the mindlessly generic and well nigh unGooglable \"Anna\" is beyond me. \"Anna\" is an okay way to kill a couple of hours, if you don't have anything else to do. But Dorado's attempt at a Hitchcockian suspense movie falls flat. If you want to see Strong in a moody noir-ish thriller, try \"Welcome to the Punch,\" a proper British film where everybody uses their real accent. Or just watch \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\" again.",
         "Memory detectives have the ability to enter their client's memories. The largest memory detective agency is Mindscape run by Sebastian (Brian Cox). John Washington (Mark Strong) is one of the best but he had a break down. He needs the money and returns for another job. Sebastian gives him the supposed easy case of gifted Anna Greene (Taissa Farmiga) who refuses to eat. Her mother Michelle (Saskia Reeves) and stepfather Robert (Richard Dillane) are one of the richest family. Judith (Indira Varma) monitors Anna 24/7. As John dives into her memories, it becomes questionable what is the real truth. I like the overall paranoid feel. However there seems to be some easier detective work that could provide proof outside of his memory work. I keep thinking that there are missing pieces or avenues in the movie. I don't know why John is not more suspicious of Anna. The final scheme is so convoluted and specific that it's unlikely to work out exactly like that. The writing by the Holmes need a few more passes and maybe by a fresh pair of eyes. Jorge Dorado is trying to step up to the big director's chair and delivers a workmanlike effort. Taissa Farmiga is intriguing and Strong is effective. However the script is not quite right. The idea itself is not particularly new but I do like the Hitchcockian feel. The final twist is obvious before the reveal but I still like it. The movie could be much better.",
         "Summary: Mindscape is a decent thriller that delivers some twists and surprises. 70/100 (B-) A man with the ability to enter peoples' memories takes on the case of a brilliant, troubled sixteen-year-old girl to determine whether she is a sociopath or a victim of trauma. I saw some of the trailers and they were very interesting to me, however in spite of its boring trailers, I saw the movie and I really liked it. It may be predictable for some people but not to me. The premise is interesting and the cast did an awesome job during the whole film. The entire cast is so damn talented, Taissa Farmiga (American Horror Story) and Mark Strong (Kick-Ass) did an amazing job here. Moving on, the concept is awesome and original to me but I have some issues with the script, because some of the dialog was predictable and the film becomes somewhat silly in its third act. Anyway, the most interesting elements in Mindscape are all the \"visions\" that the film shows us, some of them are very disturbing and strange. The movie cares about its characters and their previous story. In addition, all of these characters are very well developed. I actually felt sorry for Anna's character, her story is quite sad; also, Taissa Farmiga does an excellent job performing Anna's role. Moving on, the film keeps you guessing the whole time and I liked that; you don't trust in some of these characters and you don't know if Anna is crazy or she's just an innocent girl. It is entertaining and it makes sense. Another thing that I like about it is the ending, Mindscape ended up being entertaining, interesting, different, well filmed and superbly acted; in spite of some weak dialog and a messy final act. Its final act has its ups and downs, but the last 5 minutes are quite good, the ending is perfect and well done. I also loved the art design of the end credits. I think that it deserves at least a 7/10 rating, it's a very underrated flick. (B-)",
         "Anna, or Mindscape as the original title goes, rides heavily on the presence and acting capabilities of its two main leads, Mark Strong as John, a psychologist with mind reading abilities, and Taissa Farmiga as Anna, his young and eerily disturbed patient. The film itself revolves around the idea that certain humans have developed their latent psychic abilities to such a degree that they can read the minds of others and thus help them overcome traumas and illnesses of the mind. Yeah, it's a bit Inception-esque, but it's different enough in style and atmosphere that you won't mind. Still, the best part about this film is Mark Strong. His quiet dignified performance holds almost all of the scenes together and his interactions with Farmiga are very interesting to witness. Farmiga's performance suffers a touch from her relative inexperience, at least compared to Strong. You can definitely tell that she's acting in the earlier scenes, but she gets better quickly and her character as a whole nails the eery wonder child trope. Plot-wise the film is nothing special, being relatively easy to predict and offering no real twists, but it's more of a moodpiece in any case. I would have liked for the actual mindscape scenes to be a bit more creative and the story as a whole to be a bit more overreaching in scope, but those lacks only mean that the film is merely good instead of great. Mindscape is worth a watch if you're looking for a thriller with a more thoughtful tone and lacking in excessive brutality and gore."
