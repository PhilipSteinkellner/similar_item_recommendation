         "There are some movies that insult your intelligence, that present you with inane dialogue, bad direction, non-existent plots, and sloppy acting. Some movies contain one or more of these factors...some contain all of them in varying degrees. But in The Creeping Terror, each factor is included and ramped up to a Spinal Tap 11. The Creeping Terror is the worst movie I have ever seen. It takes badness to a level I had previously thought unattainable. Motion pictures of this anti-calibre (Manos: The Hands Of Fate is another example, and even THAT is better than this ultra-turkey) are so mind-bendingly awful they achieve a kind of transcendent brilliance that is impossible to describe in words. It takes real effort to make a movie this bad, folks. Anyway, the 'plot'. Reversed stock footage of an ICBM or Mercury rocket crashlands in Angel County, California, and disgorges a hideous man-eating creature that resembles a squashed fish finger with a camo print bridal train. The pantomime meance crawls with painful slowness about the countryside, killing people by somehow encouraging them to not run away and actually force themselves into its' bottomless gullet. As the alien snacks on the populace, the government tries to keep the threat under wraps, while assigning a scientist who is younger than one might think, an army commander with a troop of six men and a newly-wed deputy sheriff to combat the invasion. Legend has it that most (if not all) of the soundtrack of The Creeping Terror was lost after shooting was completed, and if this is true, then the loss was a truly inspired accident. In the place of 99% of the dialogue, we get *incredibly* earnest narration. Narration that swerves giddily off-topic at any moment, mind you. For instance, in the midst of the non-action, the voiceover guy and the movie stop to deliver a bizarre homily on the virtues of marriage. This is accompanied by a scene where the deputy and his new bride make out like demons in front of the former's pal. Creepy is an apt word, especially with a title like this movie has. Voiceover Guy keeps you amused as the flick staggers through its' short-but-interminable duration, detailing what our heroes are discussing as they mouth the words. Some events that need explanation are not narrated, others that do not are. There's no pattern to the use of voiceiver, any more than there is a pattern to the plot. But it gets worse. Who can go past the thermometer scene, in which a soon-to-be-eaten mother takes her baby's temperature THAT way? Thankfully, the act is implied rather than shown, but one must wonder what the scriptwriter was thinking...or on...when he wrote that part. 50s and 60s monster flicks always have some sort of sexual moral on show, and Terror is no exception. Most of the carpet monster's victims are eaten while they're necking. Or dancing. Yes, the hysterically drawn-out jive dance massacre near the end of the film (which comes complete with irrelevant greaser fistfight) shows us clearly that if you're going to boogie on down to the devil's music in the mid-60s, you should fully expect to be consumed by a panto slug from Venus. There are so many fantastically awful bits in the movie I could mention...the death of Fat Grandpa, the anti-tree rage attack said fat person's grandson has shortly before the slaying, the tootling music that replaces sound for most of the movie's last third, the scenes where the army guys pretend to fire their toy guns at the alien...and the truly demented scene where the deputy sheriff ineffectually beats the control panels of the UFO with his gun...and later a steel pipe... for an uninterrupted two minutes without the slightest success. The concluding narration, where Dr Bradford's hope for the future of Humanity is detailed by the narrator, rivals or beats any of the crazy speeches in the films of Russ Meyer or Ed Wood. Students of fetishism may see some significance in the way the director lingers on shots of female legs sticking out of the alien's mouth. Demented beyond words, this is a Grade AAAA+ ultrabomb that makes Plan From Outer Space look like Dawn Of The Dead. Lovers of bad cinema must see it! There is NO film worse, trust me. Oh, and I must add that the deputy sheriff's wife's exceptional beauty makes me wonder why *this* was the best movie she could manage to get signed on for.",
         "Another Mystery Science Theater 3000 classic, The Creeping Terror, oh, how this \"film\" makes me laugh like no other. This is the movie that you hear about that was made in the old days that had the worst effects in the world, the horrible acting, the plot holes that stretch from here to Albania, and the God awful story that just makes you wonder what the writers must have been smoking to think that it was gold in their pocket. Everything that is wrong about this movie, you can imagine it, it's just ridicules. A newlywed deputy, Martin Gordon, encounters an alien spacecraft that has crash landed in fictional Angel County in California. A large, slug like, monster emerges from the side of an impacted spaceship. A second one, still tethered inside, kills a forest ranger and the sheriff when they independently enter the craft to investigate. Martin, now temporary sheriff, joins his wife Brett; Dr. Bradford, a renowned scientist; and Col. James Caldwell, a military commander and his men to fight the creature. Meanwhile the monster stalks the countryside, devouring a girl in a bikini, picnickers at a hootenanny, Grandpa Brown and his grandson while fishing, a housewife hanging the laundry, the patrons at the community dance hall, and couples in their cars at lovers' lane. The protagonists ultimately deduce that the monsters are not intelligent. They are mindless biological-sample eaters. The bio-analysis data is microwaved back to the probe's home planet through the spaceship. At the end of the film, both creatures are destroyed, but not before the signal is sent, boding ill for the human race, but perhaps a threat that may not come for another two million years. The galaxy to which the transmission was aimed is a million light years away, in the opinion of the dying scientist character. Seriously, my favorite scene will always be the dance hall scene, this HUGE sluggish slow thing that goes into the local dance manages to eat everybody? Not only that but randomly a fight breaks out between the people for no reason. For some reason people are screaming at each other vs. just trying to escape the monster. I love also how everyone that gets eaten by this creature doesn't really run, they just stand there waiting for the monster to eat them. As a episode for Mystery Science Theater 3000 this is a true classic of it's own, I highly recommend it, if you're looking for the ultimate laugh, go ahead and see it, Mike and the robots just add the commentary that you're pretty much thinking and just needs to be said out loud. This is one of the best bad movies ever made, it's so much fun to make fun of and I'm sure that your parents will deny that they ever existed during the 1950's. 1/10",
         "You think \"Plan Nine\" was bad? At least Ed Wood had sync sound, and shot the film with the right exposure. This wacky little gem from 1964 is my vote for the worst film ever. A monster (made up of a moldy carpet flung over crawling kids, who are plainly visible) attacks locals in Nevada. Director Art J. Nelson (Who resembles a spaced out Tarantino, and plays the film's hero.) reportingly lost the dialog track to the film, but replaced missing talk with a narrator for driver safety films. Highlights include the carpet guy attacking a high school dance (Monster makes sure he doesn't wreck tables and chairs) the army is called out in one scene (This \"army\" consists of five guys in helmets being transported in a pick-up truck!) 80 minutes of mindless fun. It's like watching local third graders doing a production of \"Bridge On River Kwai\"",
         "There was only one possible reason for this movie to be made and that was to see women's rears stuck up into the air as they went down the monster's gullet. Just to keep from being called a pervert, the director tosses the monster some male actors and extras he didn't want to pay. Monster ? It's a living shag rug with several other dirty shag rugs sewn together. At one point, it even snags on a car and the \"puppeteers and victims\" inside have to hump a car to get freed. In fact, you know its going to be a bad movie because it requires a narrator to explain what's going on as you watch it. Actually, the narration is supposed to cover up a lost soundtrack; any sane director would have called it off at that point. The \"attacks\" are pretty ridiculous; the thing moves so slow that everyone has well enough time to run, and it makes so much noise there's no way it can sneak up on you. These people want to be eaten so the monster dutifully obliges. This movie may have been made just to show off the rolling hills and scenery of Lake Tahoe where it was filmed. After this movie, you'd think no one would ever go there again.",
         "I agree with all of the comments made here, except those that state that \"The Creeping Terror\" has no redeeming value. I couldn't disagree more. Just remembering scenes from this turkey has given me innumerable laughs over the years! That is worth a lot. Yes, it makes \"Plan Nine\" seem like sophistication itself. Yes, it is the worst movie ever made. But that doesn't mean it's not lovable! Just thinking of the contrived staging in order to make it seem (unsuccessfully) plausible that this laboriously slow-moving creature could catch anyone who was not unconscious brings on a giggle. It gives new meaning to the stage direction: \"Stands rooted in fear.\" Watching those Army guys squeeze themselves together into a \"catchable\" grouping, so tightly packed that they don't even have space to aim their weapons, is hilarious! And to think that this \"indestructible\" creature is ultimately killed by some guy running into it with his car is a total hoot! No Japanese super weapons needed here!! Considering how bad the sound is, maybe the funniest thing is that when persons are eaten by the creature, their screams are just as loud after being swallowed as they were on the outside. If you're missing the laughs in this movie, maybe you need to view it a couple more times. \"The Creeping Terror\" is a terrible/funny film.",
         "Forget Manos, this is without a doubt the worst movie EVER MADE! The incredibly dull monster, bad dubbing, bad acting, annoying narration and lack of narration during parts where you need it, the stupid couples who never learned how to run, the idiot military who cant figure out how to shoot a gun, the unexplained sub plots,no Torgo, EVERYTHING IS WRONG IN THIS MOVIE!! Even watching it on MST3K is nearly impossible, but if you are going to watch it, use Mike and the bots!! The movie starts with stock footage of a space shuttle lifting playing backwards. A couple and a cop decide to investigate, blah blah blah monster eats people, blah blah blah monster explodes. AVOID THIS FILM BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY!",
         "What really sets this movie apart from other bad films is the makers' utter lack of embarrassment at the disastrous technical execution of the film. It isn't just that the monster is an old carpet, the exterior of the spaceship appears to be a garage door, and the editing is so incongruous it seems almost abstract. These shameless idiots actually lost or destroyed or never made a soundtrack, so they substituted bad narration (complete with weird pseudo-psychological non-sequitor explanations of characters' motivations), random dubbing of snatches of dialogue (\"My god! What is it?\"), even more random music (startlingly awful music) and under-mixed sound effects. You must see it. It's so bad it commands your attention, but the pacing is so slow it can only really be watched in fast forward.",
         "I usually get a kick out of watching science fiction movies made forty or more years ago, especially those where the inside of the spaceship is so spacious with an enormously large amount of headroom, the astronauts dressed like factory workers, the equipment on board looking hopelessly cumbersome gawky and ineffectual. The story line was usually lame and the special effects usually extremely amateurish and sometimes laughable. But to some extent or other they are good fun to watch and are funny since no sensible person could possibly take such movies seriously. One just sits back and enjoys the ride. There are exceptions, however. Those include movies which unabashedly demonstrate the lowest possible acumen in ALL departments namely plot, story line, quality of cinematography, editing, sound, special effects, props, acting, revealing mistakes etc. A lot of movies are deficient in all of these but most directors make some sort of attempt to ensure some sort of acceptable standard otherwise, why bother, right? The other night I watched TCT on the Drive-In channel and, as the movie progressed, I was scarcely able to really believe what I was looking at. It was rock bottom in ALL departments. It was almost as though the people involved in this movie did not really want to have anything to do with it but they were somehow or other obliged to persevere, to the detriment of the actors, crew and ultimately the audience. The Swiffer, Shag pile..no sorry I mean err umm Monster (yes, that's the word I was looking for), the absolutely superb acting, the incredibly high quality sound track, the really authentic looking spacecraft (later eagerly emulated by the producers of 2001 - A Space Oddyssey), the crack troop of soldiers with their pop guns and water pistols, the Oscar nominated editing work. All these facets were displayed and undertaken at the lowest possible standard. In fact, the producer of this movie must not simply have scraped the bottom of the barrel, he must have looked underneath it! Whoever it was that conceived and executed this DUNGHEAP of a movie must be severely smitten with such a level of masochism as to warrant their being incarcerated into a lunatic asylum. When they had finished this movie, and then reviewed the pre-release pilot and agreed to circulate it, what on earth went through their heads? How ANYBODY in their right mind could POSSIBLY have thought that this movie had ANY merit whatsoever is mind boggling. Did anybody at the original review REALLY think \"Wow, is this ever a GOOD movie. Can't wait to see how it is received!\" No cinema that showed it could have possibly felt happy about doing so (the viewpoint that a movie is good because it is so bad did not have prevalence in those days). A deserved career suicide for ALL concerned.",
         "I agree with another viewer, this is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I must admit I have only seen it once and was with a group of people in a party atmosphere, but we all laughed til it hurt. I would like to know where I can get a copy of this classic.",
         "Yes! It's all true! By any standard of film-making (acting, lighting, sound, direction, writing, pacing, camera-work, sets, characterization, etc.) The Creeping Terror justifiably earns the very lowest score possible. I don't believe that a worse movie could be made, intentionally or otherwise. So why do I love this film? There's something undeniably sincere about this movie. The writer/director/leading man Art Nelson must have believed so strongly in the project that he insisted on finishing it even when he accidentally dumped the audio equipment into Lake Tahoe. The actors were REALLY trying to look scared when they were crawling into the creature's mouth. (OK, maybe Grandpa was a bit slack in that department.) The dancers were giving it their all--even that guy that keeps hopping up and down and twisting his forearms in tight little circles. The narrator did his best to dramatize the action. (\"...GRENADES!\") The soldiers took obligingly took Mr. Nelson's direction and stood motionless in a small group waiting for the creature to devour them. They all must have BELIEVED that they were doing good work. It's a tribute to the (admittedly bizarre) vision of Art Nelson that this movie was made, much less released. What did he see that we can't? This is a fascinating movie that I have watched dozens of times and will watch many more times. It's not a worthless waste of time. It's true auteur-ship at it's misguided best."
