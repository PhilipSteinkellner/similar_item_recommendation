         "When this film was made Chevalier was aged 48 and had already made over 30 films.By contrast Lockwood was aged 22 and had made 9.They are a rather odd couple in a rather strange story.Firstly we have Autin Trevor offering Chevalier £10000 not to pursue Betty Stockfield.This he agrees to as the money is to be given to Stockfield's fathers creditors to save him from bankruptcy.Chevalier then goes off to France with a young Desmond Testler in tow.Testler's character is not related to Chevalier's.Chevalier meets Lockwood on the road and eventually falls for her.When he gets the chance to take up with Stockfield again he first seizes then rejects the chance in order to be with Lockwood.However there is very little chemistry between the two.Little also to make one suspect that within a couple of years Lockwood would become a big star.",
         "This film made in 1936 shows Margaret Day Lockwood's continuing her development into a British leading lady actress.Made during the latter part of her film apprenticeship, she is teamed up with the great Maurice Chevalier (Paragot) in a musical playing an honest waif (Blanquette), who is looking for work in cabaret. Maurice, a landlord, has to leave his official fiancé, (Joanna Rushworth), played by Betty Stockfeld, because he does not want her fraudulent father to suffer the weight of the law for his embezzlement of £10,000 which a rich businessman will cover as long as Maurice agrees not to see Joanna as he has designs on her himself.Maurice feels he should leave his home in England and go travelling to France together with a talented artistic boy (one of his tenants Asticot), played by Desmond Tester.Along the way they meet the waif Blanquette who is short of money but insists on repaying Maurice's loan of 10 Francs as soon as she is in work. The story is about how you should choose a wife/husband who is naturally suited to you culturally and socially and not for personal aggrandisement or for money."
