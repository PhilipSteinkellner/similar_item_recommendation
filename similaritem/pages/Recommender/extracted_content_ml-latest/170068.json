      "reviews": ["Cagan Irmak's latest film opens with a dream-sequence in which sculptor Temmuz (Deniz Celiloglu) dreams of a new beginning, heralded by a young man (Aras Bulut Iynemli). While out by the sea in Istanbul one day, he sees the young man in human form: born without arms or legs, Ihsan (the young man's name) leads a half-life, being cared for by his mother (Zuhal Gencer). Temmuz concocts a scheme whereby he can see Ihsan on a regular basis, and tells him that, as Ihsan appeared in his dream, the two men's lives must be inextricably linked. Ihsan agrees, but asks in return that Temmuz should kill him, as he (Ihsan) wants to ask God why he should have been born as he was. The film charts their relationship, as Ihsan ends up moving in with Temmuz. As a sculptor, Temmuz is interested in recreating human forms; once Ihsan appears in his life, he approaches his creative task with a renewed vigor, while at the same time trying to treat Ihsan like a normal human being (something the young man has not experienced before). Director Irmak has a lot to say about human relationships, and how destiny can sometimes bring people together in the strangest of ways. The only real problem with TAMAM MIYIZ? is the ending, which seems somehow rushed after Irmak has taken so much care to establish the relationship between his two protagonists. Nonetheless credit must be given to the two leading actors, especially Iynemli, who turns in a performance little short of miraculous,"],
