         "This movie is not a \"rock\" movie. It is a \"people\" movie. The performances turned in by the cast were complete, realistic and believable. I say this from the standpoint of someone (a female) who hammered it out in a working rock band for 20 years... The characters had unfortunate crappy jobs, they DID have problems with their parents and each other, as life on the road is HARD. In fact, out of all the \"rock-n-roll\" movies I have ever seen, this played out to touch home better than anything else. The person who wrote the scathing review ~ I'd bet my Gibson he was never in a bar band, scraping dimes together, stealing food. And I'd bet my SM57 that he never had to play the cheesy Holiday Inn Lounge. Anyone who thinks being in a working band is fun, easy, nothing but a good time, check out Light Of Day. It will open your eyes. The side-plot of an illness that strikes the family is more than touching and also true to life, as I had the same thing happened to me. The dialogue in the movie is so realistic that I can't watch it without cringing. This movie is the real deal, not some drummed up rock-n-roll fantasy compiled for \"wanna be's\" or wishful thinkers.",
         "Light of Day is one of my favourite Rock n' Roll films. Not the most popular choice, I'll grant you. A lot of people might question that, but let me explain my point of view. Most rock films deal with the rock star lifestyle. You know all the clichés: sex, drugs, booze, limos, groupies, hotel room demolition and general decadence (not that there's anything wrong with that; Spinal Tap is another favourite of mine!). In other words they deal with what is essentially UNREALITY for the vast majority of rockers out there. Instead they deal with a fantasy or an ideal, with what all us rockers would like to think is waiting for us just around the corner. Light of Day, on the other hand, deals with real life, and what Rock n' Roll means to several ordinary people. Several ordinary people dealing with ordinary, everyday problems; work, relationships, family, estrangement, disillusionment. Music is their refuge. As Patti Rasnick (played by Joan Jett) says \"Music is all that matters. One hour on stage makes up for the other 23\", and that is essentially the theme of the movie; No matter what life throws at us, we'll get through it as long as we have music. A theme that is reinforced by the final musical performance of the movie (I wont give too much away, don't worry). There is absolutely no glamour to be found in this movie whatsoever; and that's one of the things I love about it! Its pure, unglamorous REALITY. Travelling in a van, playing dives, boosting food to survive another day on the road and doing it all for the love of Rock n' Roll, and knowing that the alternative is just too f**king odious to seriously contemplate... Okay sorry, I'm getting a bit heavy handed with my review here, but anyway, in conclusion: forget Family Ties (I haven't even seen an episode of that show in about 15 years, who gives a damn?), Michael J. Fox does an awesome and realistic job in Light of Day (all the members of The Barbusters played live in the performance scenes), the plot has a subtlety and realism missing in practically every other rock film I've seen, and the songs are great! Yes, I recommend this film to anybody who's ever played in a travelling band, or just loves Rock n' Roll. BTW, in case my American friends are wondering: \"favourite\", \"glamour\" and \"travelling\" are not spelling mistakes. ;-)",
         "Back when I was 21, I went with a few friends to see another film (I forget which, now) that had sold out, leaving us with this film as an option that we took. I was so pleasantly surprised that a film I would otherwise never have bothered with turned out to be so resonant with me. I expected a teenybopper rock'n'roll picture. This film is nothing close to that. This is a gritty, hard-edged slice of life. It is full of realistic human emotion and genuine observation of actual \"rock'n'roll\" lifestyle, which for the vast majority of rockers means nightly sharing of a van and a motel room and splitting up a few hundred bucks five or six ways before expenses. The scene in \"Motel Hell\" where Fox doles out the money (after enumerating the expenses including \"forty-five dollars for that tire, and eighteen for the Chinese feast\") just struck such a ringingly true chord with me. The secondary drama, which plays out as you understand that the primary drama (will the band make it?) is already moot (Fox knows that the Barbusters have no chance; Jett continues to chase the dream regardless) commences with the discovery of their mother's illness. The interplay between Jett and her mother in the hospital as the mother lays dying and they reconcile their long-hardened differences is surprisingly well-played, especially on Joan Jett's part. I expected great acting from the superb Gena Rowlands; I expected zero from Jett and was blown away instead. I'm surprised she never got any other real roles; I found her to be extremely easy on the eyes and quite a lovely and talented actress. Whatever. The film has a terrific ending. No, they don't make it to the big-time, but you never expect that to happen anyway. It is simply a satisfying ending that matches the size and scope of this terrific film, which was never intended to be anything more than a look at a Cleveland family who has two members who happen to play in a road band. Catch it once in your lifetime.",
         "This film may not be a work of genius, but it touched me deeply in 1987 and it still does. Joan Jett and Michael J. Fox touch a chord literally and figuratively as polar opposite siblings who share a passion for music. Gena Rowlands is absolutely brilliant as the desperately ill mother who clings to her faith for solace and dominates her children out of fear for them. The soundtrack is jam-packed with old-fashioned style rock n' roll. An instrumental piece (titled Elegy) underscores the leaden sadness throughout the film and is ethereal and beautiful. For anyone who has struggled with family strife, there will be familiar territory here. This film is, in my opinion, underrated and worth a second (or a first!) look.",
         "This film is notable for two reasons: The excellent writing, and the amazing acting performances of Joan Jett (surprise - this woman can ACT!), and Michael J. Fox. Mature, heart-wrentching emotional drama centered on the trials of a dysfunctional family headed by matriarch Gena Rowlands - who also gives a stellar performance. Jett should have been nominated for an Oscar for her performance - particularly the scenes with her dying mother. An insightful, brutally honest script coupled with exceptional acting produces a film of unusual emotional power. Very moving and thought-provoking. A must-see, and definitely one of the best films of the 1980s.",
         "Joe (Michael J. Fox) and Patti (Joan Jetti) play in the band `The Barbusters'. They use to play in bars in the suburbs. Patti is the singer of the band and a single mother, has a beautiful son and is very rejected by her mother Jeanette (Gena Rowlands). They do not accept and understand each other. The father of Patti's son is unknown by her family. Patti wants to follow the career of musician, but her brother uses the band indeed as an alternative for the lack of job. Joe is the link between Patti and Jeanette, trying to resolve and absorb their problems. A terminal cancer in Jeanette changes the relationship among the family and cruel revelations are presented in the end, with a final redemption of the characters. The melodramatic screenplay of this movie looks like a Mexican soap opera, but the soundtrack is great. There is a minor participation of Jimmie Vaughn, as the singer of another band (`The Fabulous Thunderbirds'). This movie is not a masterpiece, but entertains, especially if the viewer watches it without any expectation, just for killing time. My vote is five.",
         "I thought this film had an original story and a great script. Michael J. Fox puts forth a wonderful attempt to make us believe he is Joe Rasnick, aspiring rock performer, and, as always his acting is on the level and heartfelt. Joan Jett, while trying really hard to play the wild and sometimes estranged sister Patti, just can't seem to find the emotion needed to make her role believable (her musical performance doesn't disappoint, though). Gena Rowlands, as usual, is superb in her attempt to make us buy her as Joan Jett's righteous and disapproving mother. All in all entertaining, yet not quite believable.",
         "I wouldn't go as far as to say this is the greatest rock n roll movie Ever, but I think this is the greatest bar band movie EVER! I grew up around Cleveland about this time, and this is how it was! My brothers are muscicians, and this was THEIR story! Back then, not many movies were filmed in Cleveland because of how it looked. It was sooooo refreshing to see a movie that not only showed how Cleveland looked, but how the people that lived there REALLY were! Joe( Michael J. Fox) reminds me so much of my brother it's scary! And Patti ( Joan Jett) was who I wanted to be!! Not to mention the music ROCKS!! I have been to the Euclid Tavern ( I think it's closed now) and the Akron Agaora (I know that's closed) and that's how they really were! Kudos to Paul Schrader for making this movie! BTW........CLEVELAND ROCKS!!!!! (Did I mention that Michael J. Fox is my favorite actor? GET BETTER MICHAEL!!!!!!!)",
         "I never enjoyed the cutesy characters they always have Fox portray. Here he does a great job as a \"regular\", decent guy who is loyal to his family and just wants to know what his dream is. I think that Joan Jett did a fantastic job -- not too many musicians can cross over so well into movies. Fox and Jett are believable as brother and sister and Gena Rowlands is always incredible. I think this movie was panned because people expect Mr. Fox to be silly and boyish (two things that he wasn't in this movie.) Good for you, Michael.",
         "This movie has really received undue negative ratings. With rocker Joan Jett in the cast, I'm sure most people were expecting a fun rock and roll movie. Instead we got a somber movie about forgiveness and reconciling with the people you love. Jett may not be perfect, but she certainly isn't the hack of an actress that this film's detractors make her out to be. I thought she brought a blue collar sensibility and realism to the part. Also, Jett and Michael J. Fox were portraying members of a bar band. If you expected them to sound polished and professional, you really missed the point. The story may have moved slowly at times, but I found it to be quite original. Although the mother died, I don't see what's so cliche about it. The tension between Gena Rowlands and Jett was quite believable. I liked that is wasn't sugar-coated. If this movie had been sugar-coated a bit, I'm sure the ratings would have been higher and I'm sure it would have made more money. However, I don't think it would have been as good of a film. Give it another chance."
