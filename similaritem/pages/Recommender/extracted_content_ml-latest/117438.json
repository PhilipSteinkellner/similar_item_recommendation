She is sent to relatives in the country to recuperate from severe sickness.\r\n\r\nOnce there she meets another young girl, who is blond and also has beautiful blue eyes like Anna. Anna feels real connection to this girl. During the film we learn more and more about Anna and this young girl. \r\n\r\nIt is a film that is both beautiful very well worth seeing.",

            "content": "> Some people're destined to meet the secret friend.\r\n\r\nFrom the director Hiromasa Yonebayashi of 'The Secret World of Arriety' fame. Based on the 1967 English novel of the same name and so the important characters borrowed the western names. This is what I call a fine adaptation, great transformation from the words to the motion picture. Actually, it suited for the narration from the standpoint of Japanese culture and lifestyle, especially for this anime version with the beautiful fictional coastal landscapes. Whenever I remember this film in the future, that Marsh house would be the first thing to pop out in my mind, an unforgettable landmark for sure.\r\n\r\nThe movie promos were damp. The posters were not that impressive, but okay and the trailer was very ordinary. Studio Ghibli was the reason to go for it, so I expected nothing spectacular from the movie. Even while I was watching, I thought it was just an enjoyable mystery flick, but you know sometime the value of the whole movie comes at the end twist. Once the end was near my stance changed, especially after the hidden truth revelation. Some movies need a re-watch to terminate any doubts regarding characters and scenes. As for this movie, if your focus is straight, then it's does not require.\r\n\r\nNot a technical brilliance like the director's previous movie, but the story was strong and twisty. The characters were very interesting, suspense was the movie's influence for the audience to stick till the end. There is no loose end, certainly gives a few topics to discuss about, but the narration moves on a circular track and hits back like the boomerang. That does not mean it is a time travel or something. The narration bends and blends with the time. To realise what is real and what is not, you have to wait till the end. After seeing the film, I understood everyone's childhood memories could monopolize if we encounter same object, place, person and other things again in the later life. Yes, I had few minor experience in my life as well.\r\n\r\nThe opening dialogue itself a hint of what kind of movie it is going to be. There are two prominent girls, Anna and Marnie in the story, like the Anna and Elsa from 'Frozen'. The narration flips on a regular basis to tell the multiple layered story. As this film was a puzzle in portrayal, obviously viewers try to solve it, including me. I tried my best. I thought Anna's childhood toy was something to do with all the fuss, but I was terribly wrong. That was a perfect divert if you observe it closely. In another perspective, I kept 'The Others' and 'The Orphanage' in mind, but was not even close to where this story was heading. Whether you succeed or not, very fun to solve a mystery, you know. Finally, it gave me full satisfaction like that indirectly I saw 'The Uninvited' once again.\r\n\r\nFeels like the Oscars was concluded yesterday, but I am already thinking about the next one. If I am not wrong this movie is definitely one of the contenders for the best animation race, along with 'The Good Dinosaur' probably. Absolutely, I would be disappointed if I don't see it in the final five. There is lots of time between now and then, so anything might happen, who knows. After all, this film has already won my little heart and millions of other's. I know no one can replace Mr. Miyazaki, but feels like Hiromasa Yonebayashi could come near if his future projects as much effective as his one. Best of luck to him and he's only a 41. But remember Isao Takahat is 80 and still in the race, yet to announce his retirement. And this film was very close to his 'Only Yesterday'.\r\n\r\n> I love you more than any girl I've ever known.\r\n\r\nStudio Ghibli is like Disney Studio from the east. As we know, narrating a fairy tale having the tween girls in the lead is what they're famous for. The previous couple of movies were out of their trademark, so, happy they are back with this masterwork. At a same time I am very very very very sad, because it's their final movie after the 30 years of triumph. Since Hayao Miyazaki's retirement everything falling apart from the studio's management. They've given reasons and it is only a temporary, though hope the rise of 3D animation is not the one to halt the production, praying for the pause to be lifted soon.\r\n\r\nThis film is not just passing through from this giant anime production house, but it is a masterpiece. As usual, it is a girly movie and that does not stop grownups, especially men from a watch. I loved it, everytime when I like a movie I express my desire for a sequel and so I did for this film. Though it was one time story with nothing left over for further development, possibly some new thing can be attached to it. Whatever happens this movie will remain as one of the best from the studio and can compete with any modern animations and live-shot masterworks. Highly recommended, not just for anime or animation fans, but for mystery and who love the layers in story narration.\r\n\r\n9/10",

         "Following Miyazaki's retirement, the pressure was heavy on Director Yonebayashi as the next successor of Ghibli Studio. But in the Japanese multimedia, it was stated by the Former Director Miyazaki and Producer Suzuki that the future successor was finally decided after watching Yonebayashi's first solo directed movie \"When Marnie Was There (2014)\". Was this really the case? My answer - Yes. This movie is unique in a sense that the story revolves around two female protagonists \"Anna\" and \"Marnie\"; although it does remind us a hint of the nostalgic movie \"My Neighbour Totoro\" which starred \"Satsuki\" and \"May\", their relationship is far more complex. As the story progresses, their relationship becomes more clear and vivid to the audience, and the confusion of the intertwining reality and the dreamlike world starts to unfold. The two girls go on a journey as they discover each others past and dwells upon their current problems, and gradually develops an unbreakable bond that unites them stronger. Although the trailer did cause some confusing misunderstandings between the two girls in Japan, and at the same time my expectations lowered; after watching the movie it was no doubt a splendid and flawless piece of art both literally and figuratively. It is worth noting that Yonebayashi truly challenged the impossible, as even Miyazaki had once thought of making this novel into a movie but had backed down due to its continuous complex changes that occur in the world of the two girls. Furthermore, Yonebayashi has created his \"own\" depiction of the sky in this movie, and is no longer the \"blue sky\" and \"white clouds\" that Miyazaki has portrayed in his series of work. So we can expect to see his own unique world of Ghibli gradually bloom in the next upcoming years. To summarize the experience, it was astonishing how we, the audience ourselves can go on a journey together with the protagonists to overcome their obstacles. Paying attention to the changes in Anna's facial expressions is extremely crucial if you want to enjoy this movie. The succinct yet complex portrayal of these two girls really make you think of the depths of friendship.To conclude, I would like to end with Suzuki's logo that he had written for the advertising poster. The message of the logo is so sincere that to me there is no better way of epitomizing the message that the author and the director was trying to convey to the audience - „Äå„ÅÇ„Å™„Åü„ÅÆ„Åì„Å®„ÅåÂ§ßÂ•Ω„Åç„Äç- \"I love you\"; an unconditional love.",
         "Have you experienced a feeling like this? The kind of feeling that your sorrow and loneliness nailed you down and you fell into the deep darkness alone, then you stood up, and finds sparks and sparks of lights appeared, leading you to the end of the nightmare, and when came out, you found the sunshine was warmer than ever? This is the movie \"when Marnie was there\". I like this movie. It's a story about two lonely girls, about family and the world, magical but real. As a OCD viewer, my left brain kept investigating who that girl is, and my right was eager to know what will happen next. The good thing is, however, both my brains were astonished and satisfied again and again, unlike how other Ghibli movies roll. This new film, which is the first one after the retirement of the two great founders, shows the skills and talent of the next generation Ghibli artists. Future is saved, or maybe better? And as many Ghibli movies, \"when Marnie was there\" is full of beautiful paintings and musics, voices recreating the characters vividly, and an unforgettable theme song in the end. The story, like I said, is fabulous. I don't like spoiling movies, and the secret in this case is the core and foundation of everything. I'll leave it to you to discover. Enjoy!",
         "This film has the honour of being the first anime film that I experienced on the big screen. I THINK the moments when I was walking out the door after the movie defined what I felt about the film: I overheard a teenage girl saying: 'Don't know about you, but I never noticed violin music in films before this.' Then she proceeds to hum Anna's theme out loud...note by note. OK, first of all, I don't know what films she has being watching before this, because pretty much every film I watched with a decent score had music I can remember. But even I must admit: The music is the hero in this film, its by far the loudest sound maker in the film, as the strings overwhelms you while the subdued virtual camera pans across typically well-produced Ghibli background art with a bit of light sound effects. I think this film has mastered musically silent scenes...by perfectly contrasting them with scenes where the music takes the reins. The feelings to dread, loneliness and the atmospheric feelings when Anna was exploring the marshes. I find it intriguing that Marnie's theme was hinted at the beginning, even before the appearance of Marnie, taking its full form about half way into the film, but was never given a full fanfare moment: its a tender woodwind led melody that usually takes the form of a bittersweet waltz, its really quite beautiful to see our two main characters dance to it. Anna's theme; definitely the most memorable theme of the film; is written sorely for tear-jerking. The second phrase of this theme takes the form of a 7 note motif, with the first note jumping almost an octave apart to the second before sliding down with the following 5 notes: vintage nostalgic and beautiful writing. Anyone who can survive these 7 simple notes must have a brick for a heart. And this basically sums up the music of this film: simple, beautiful and absolutely nostalgic: it is able to etch itself into your brain without the brute force of brass and percussion, relying mainly on tender piano and woodwind solos and a warm strings section. Even the credits song; interestingly sung and written in English; is practically created just to give you nostalgic feelings and tender melancholy. If I have to describe this film in one word, it would be 'sweet.' That's it. Sweet. Every character; no matter the amount of screen time they get, are awfully likable, the Oiwa family is fun to watch while they had the spotlight, Sayaka, who briefly appears as an adventurous and curious girl, is pleasant to see on screen, Anna and Marnie share a lot of sweet and cute moments, each one leaving you with a big smile on your face. The exceptions to this are characters mainly shown shown in flashbacks: the maids and a brief character called Emily. What I like about Ghibli films like this; a general lack of concrete plot timeline (see Kiki, Totoro and Poppy Hill); is just how...character-driven these films are: there's no plot points that taints and 'conveniently' motivates the characters, instead the plot is moved along by character motivation itself; even if some characters may appear for just seconds...they still somehow serve a profound purpose: The most brutal scenes in the entire film is when the elder Hisako tells her story to Anna and Sayaka: we get to see how Hisako, Anna and Marnie are connected through time. Granted, I would've like to see more of Marnie, Sayaka and Hisako; particularly Hisako; but what I got was satisfying. Needless to say, the art and animation is flawless, Studio Ghibli just utterly celebrates hand drawn animation...its backgrounds feels like vivid recreations of Monet paintings brought to life, the Marsh House drawn on pencil by Anna and oil painted by Hisako looked stunning on screen. So...is this a good film to farewell Ghibli in the foreseeable future? Yes. Is it a masterpiece? It succeeds in many ways but fails in some others. Like I said, the side characters have much more to bring to the table, Anna can be a bit whiny and annoying at first, but she grows like any main character should, Marnie feels too...perfect, and her backstory does not seem to fit her character at times...but she's still a likable presence on screen. Overall, a must watch if you want a easy segway to slowly get into Ghibli films. The soundtrack? Now, this is a possible masterpiece...I would rate score with 5* if its theme based rating only, but overall, its a 4.5*. I also recommend you to check out the included image album: particularly the Anna theme suite.",
         "A young girl moves to the country for the summer under the advice of her doctor. There she befriends a young girl with flowing blonde hair who she begins to build a close bond with. The two build a strong friendship, though the mysterious, ethereal Marnie clearly is more then meets the eye. The movie When Marnie Was There, appears from the outset to be a coming of age story, with the focus being a young girl discovering her past in a far off place, through the mysterious Marnie. However to contrast the tropes of the coming of age narrative, there is an unshakable sense of passing in this story, from the ghostly appearance of Marnie, to the mysterious boatman and the frail condition of our heroine Anna, we have a tale which is as much a story of childhood as it is of eventual adulthood and death. Much has been made of this movie for being the first Studio Ghibli movie post Miyazaki's and Takahata's retirement, both of whom were the founders of Studio Ghibli as we know it. Many have speculated as to whether this movie offers a glimpse of the future of Ghibli in younger hands, and from reading a few of the English language reviews already availible, many seem to contemplate whether this is a swan song for Ghibli or possibly a new dawn. Having just seen this movie, my overriding opinion is that Ghibli is alive and well and in the director Yonebayashi, they have a director who is a fitting heir to the masters Miyazaki and Takahata. The movie When Marnie Was There carries all of the hall marks of great Ghibli, as you would expect from Ghibli there is; attention to detail, a strong narrative, well fleshed out characters, a great score, gorgeous visuals. This list reads as a standard for Ghibli animation, but what we should appreciate is that most movies failed to attain any of the points listed above, Ghibli achieves this with each and every one of their movies, and this is not attained effortlessly, but what we see when we watch a Ghibli movie are master crafts man at the peak of their creative powers striving for perfection in hand drawn animation. There is a creative vigor on the screen, one which screams both joyously and artfully. When Marnie Was There fits nicely into this bracket, and proves that Ghibli will endure long after Miyazaki and Takahata has left the building.",
         "I've nearly watched all animations by Studio Ghibli (and many others other than from this studio) and I can with certainty say that this one is the best animated one! It's like a live-action film with great actors :) Every single emotion is magnificently drawn! When you watch this animation, you shouldn't expect a thriller or scenes of action.. the story is widely dramatic and heartbreaking. It has lots of suspenseful moments that make you want to watch it till the end and the ending is really worth the wait! The anime is about family problems and a young & ill girl's way of dealing with it. One could say that it is her coming of age story which is not easy for her, so she finds a \"friend\", a mysterious foreigner who helps to find herself and make her see the world with different eyes ;) People who think animations are just for children or for younger generation are completely wrong! If you have prejudices, go and watch one and see it for yourself! I can recommend Spirited Away & Grave of the Fireflies. And I really can't believe that Studio Ghibli will take a break from filmmaking now... or will maybe never come back to it again. It's a mess! After seeing so much untalented people doing so many films and earning much money (especially those cheesy Hollywood animations), although for not deserving it, I'm aware of the fact that real artists should be praised! BTW: I don't easily give a film 10/10 ;)",
         "\"When Marnie was There\" is about a lonely girl named Anna who stays with her Aunt and Uncle in the countryside for heath reasons and while there she strikes a friendship with Marnie, an unusual girl who lives in an old mansion by the lake. Hiromasa Yonebayashi's second film as a director, following \"The Secret World of Arietty\" is a wonderful tale about adolescence and growing up. The film has beautiful animation and a style that departs from Miyazaki's films - being more grounded in reality, but still having moments of magical realism whenever the two girls meet. Pacing can seem slow and sedate at times, especially for the first forty minutes when not much seems to be happening in terms of plot, but if you see it through to the end, everything comes together nicely in this mysterious and sometimes emotional story. Studio Ghibli have said that \"Marnie\" might be their last picture, or at least their last feature film - which is a bit sad because the company has consistently made excellent animations throughout the years - Miyazaki or otherwise. I hope they do return with more films in future, developing a new generation of talent and keeping traditional animation alive.",
         "I decided to watch this after seeing it's poster ad which showed two girls standing back to back close to one another, and, yes, the first thought that came across my dirty train of thoughts was, \"This must be shoujo-ai.\" That honestly what triggered me to watch it. Because, honestly, the sort of posters that come out under Studio Ghibli's works never (if I'm correct) features two girls hand in hand like the one depicted in Since Marnie Was There. But boy was I ever wrong for trusting my trashy sixth (or is it seventh??) instincts :-p The story is poignant at its best. It made me cry my eyes out almost all throughout the story, only because, I can relate to the characters' pain expressed and shared in the story very well, and I'm sure those who've experienced the kind of pain Anna and Marnie experienced in their lives. This is also the kind of story that makes you stuck in watching the show if only just to enjoy watching the beautiful scenic art and animations it could offer the audiences. I fell in love immediately after Anna arrived in the countryside. Gosh, the word 'beautiful' just won't do justice to how mesmerizing the art that depicts all those breath-taking scenery in this movie. And just listening to the ending song, made me bawl out ever the more, I had contain myself from making much snotty nose noises in my room, haha. In all seriousness, I want to applaud Studio Ghibli, for once, in their whole studio, for creating a story that doesn't center on LOVE between a girl and a boy, but instead, on grasping the essence meaning of the word LOVE itself, which is so much for than just a love story between a guy and girl. Love yourself, love and appreciate others, kindness, is important as well.",
         "The last film to be produced under the Studio Ghibli banner before the acclaimed animation studio decided to take a break from filmmaking following the retirement of Hayao Miyazaki, When Marnie Was There is an elegantly crafted & gorgeously animated tale that intertwines dreams with reality as well as past with present, only to end up getting entangled in its own web. Based on the novel of the same name, When Marnie Was There follows Anna; a 12-year old girl who takes a trip to a countryside town for health reasons and discovers an abandoned mansion where she finds an unlikely friend in Marnie; a blond girl. As their new relationship blossoms over the next few days & both get to know each other better, it is unraveled that Anna is more closely related to Marnie than expected. Nicely directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi, When Marnie Was There is his sophomore effort following his debut feature, The Secret World of Arrietty, which remains my favourite Studio Ghibli film to be not directed by Miyazaki. And although his latest is no doubt an ambitious work, its pay-off won't be rewarding enough emotionally unless the viewers try to connect the dots all by themselves by doing a little digging of their own. The technical aspects are expertly carried out for each frame of it is sumptuously animated & vividly photographed from start to finish. Editing tries to juggle various elements of story at once & doesn't always succeed. However, there isn't any issue with the pacing for its 103 minutes of runtime never becomes tedious at any given moment. Also, the background score brims with tracks that infuse a soothing feel into the narrative. The Japanese voice cast is only as fitting as the studio's previous works. However, it's the beautiful relationship between Anna & Marnie that leaves the biggest mark. The film can be viewed as a coming-of-age drama that follows the journey of Anna from a lonely & anxious girl at the beginning of the film to a more confident person later in the story. Marnie herself exhibits an aura of mystery around her that not only allures Anna but us viewers as well. On an overall scale, When Marnie Was There isn't as magical as Studio Ghibli's finest films but its take on friendship & isolation nonetheless manages to cast a spell of its own in bits n pieces which makes its story captivating for a while. A love story, a coming-of-age tale & a deep journey into one's own past, When Marnie Was There may or may not benefit from multiple viewings but for now, it has to settle for an underwhelming experience in my book. Still, it's worth a shot!",
         "From the director Hiromasa Yonebayashi of 'The Secret World of Arriety' fame. Based on the 1967 English novel of the same name and so the important characters borrowed the western names. This is what I call a fine adaptation, great transformation from the words to the motion picture. Actually, it suited for the narration from the standpoint of Japanese culture and lifestyle, especially for this anime version with the beautiful fictional coastal landscapes. Whenever I remember this film in the future, that Marsh house would be the first thing to pop out in my mind, an unforgettable landmark for sure. The movie promos were damp. The posters were not that impressive, but okay and the trailer was very ordinary. Studio Ghibli was the reason to go for it, so I expected nothing spectacular from the movie. Even while I was watching, I thought it was just an enjoyable mystery flick, but you know sometime the value of the whole movie comes at the end twist. Once the end was near my stance changed, especially after the hidden truth revelation. Some movies need a re-watch to terminate any doubts regarding characters and scenes. As for this movie, if your focus is straight, then it's does not require. Not a technical brilliance like the director's previous movie, but the story was strong and twisty. The characters were very interesting, suspense was the movie's influence for the audience to stick till the end. There is no loose end, certainly gives a few topics to discuss about, but the narration moves on a circular track and hits back like the boomerang. That does not mean it is a time travel or something. The narration bends and blends with the time. To realise what is real and what is not, you have to wait till the end. After seeing the film, I understood everyone's childhood memories could monopolize if we encounter same object, place, person and other things again in the later life. Yes, I had few minor experience in my life as well. The opening dialogue itself a hint of what kind of movie it is going to be. There are two prominent girls, Anna and Marnie in the story, like the Anna and Elsa from 'Frozen'. The narration flips on a regular basis to tell the multiple layered story. As this film was a puzzle in portrayal, obviously viewers try to solve it, including me. I tried my best. I thought Anna's childhood toy was something to do with all the fuss, but I was terribly wrong. That was a perfect divert if you observe it closely. In another perspective, I kept 'The Others' and 'The Orphanage' in mind, but was not even close to where this story was heading. Whether you succeed or not, very fun to solve a mystery, you know. Finally, it gave me full satisfaction like that indirectly I saw 'The Uninvited' once again. Feels like the Oscars was concluded yesterday, but I am already thinking about the next one. If I am not wrong this movie is definitely one of the contenders for the best animation race, along with 'The Good Dinosaur' probably. Absolutely, I would be disappointed if I don't see it in the final five. There is lots of time between now and then, so anything might happen, who knows. After all, this film has already won my little heart and millions of other's. I know no one can replace Mr. Miyazaki, but feels like Hiromasa Yonebayashi could come near if his future projects as much effective as his one. Best of luck to him and he's only a 41. But remember Isao Takahat is 80 and still in the race, yet to announce his retirement. And this film was very close to his 'Only Yesterday'. I love you more than any girl I've ever known. Studio Ghibli is like Disney Studio from the east. As we know, narrating a fairy tale having the tween girls in the lead is what they're famous for. The previous couple of movies were out of their trademark, so, happy they are back with this masterwork. At a same time I am very very very very sad, because it's their final movie after the 30 years of triumph. Since Hayao Miyazaki's retirement everything falling apart from the studio's management. They've given reasons and it is only a temporary, though hope the rise of 3D animation is not the one to halt the production, praying for the pause to be lifted soon. This film is not just passing through from this giant anime production house, but it is a masterpiece. As usual, it is a girly movie and that does not stop grownups, especially men from a watch. I loved it, every time when I like a movie I express my desire for a sequel and so I did for this film. Though it was one time story with nothing left over for further development, possibly some new thing can be attached to it. Whatever happens this movie will remain as one of the best from the studio and can compete with any modern animations and live-shot masterworks. Highly recommended, not just for anime or animation fans, but for mystery and who love the layers in story narration. 9/10",
         "When Marnie Was There is Studio Ghibli's last film to date, as well as the potential to be the studio's final film. Let's critique the movie, shall we? The Bad: Possibly the final Studio Ghibli that will ever be, since this movie is a box office faliure in its native Japan. The Good: Gorgeous animation, as expected from Studio Ghibli, great characters, deep and enthralling story, which I will not expain in this review since it contains spoilers, excellent voice acting courtesy of Sara Takatsuki (Anna Sasaki), Kasumi Arimura (Marnie), Susumu Terajima (Kiyomasa Oiwa), Toshie Negishi (Setsu Oiwa), Nanako Matsushima (Yoriko Sasaki), Ryoko Moriyama (Elderly Lady), Kazuko Yoshiyuki (Granny) and Hitomi Kuroki (Hisako), and finally, beautiful music courtesy of Takatsugu Muramatsu and Fine on the Outside by Priscilla Ahn is a good song as well. Since I heard Hiromasa Yonebayashi quitting Studio Ghibli, I would like to see him go to Studio Chizu and team up with Mamoru Hosoda. If you have not seen this movie, go ahead and watch it."
