      "reviews": [
         "Karloff tops a first class cast supported by the beautiful Marg Reynolds, who was at the beginning of her climb up the ladder after years of bit parts. (She was the fem lead in the best of all Abbott and Costello films, Time of Their Lives (A must see)). Grant Withers as the top cop works with the oriental Karloff character to solve a couple of murders. Others who shine are Frank Puglia as a shifty crime boss and Lita Chavret as the second fem banana. Script by Scott Darling and George Waggner holds well. This is a typical 1940's classic that is fun to watch. Directed by the very professional William Nigh who has more than 100 notches on his directorial gun. Made by Monogram studio. This is one of 50 films in the Horror Movie DVD pack that's well worth investigating. This film is well worth the time.",
         "Although not as legendary or eloquent as his contemporary British colleague Sherlock Holmes, Oriental detective Mr. Wong successfully solved quite a lot of difficult cases as well, with his splendid observation talents and marvelous deduction skills. \"The Fatal Hour\" is the fourth film in a series of six, all but one starring the unequaled master-actor Boris Karloff in the role James Lee Wong. Police Captain Bill Street always calls him upon for help whenever there's a complex murder case with connections to the oriental community of San Francisco. In \"The Fatal Hour\", Street's colleague and long time friend Dan O'Grady has been murdered during his investigation of an extended oriental jewelry smuggling network. The owner of the dubious Neptune bar near the harbor � where all the smuggling import and export takes place - is the obvious suspect, but there are a lot more people involved. This isn't a very sensational film in terms of violent bloodshed or wild car chases, but the plot is quite compelling and the dialogues are fluently written. There are a couple of ingenious red herrings and I liked the realistic aspect that Wong isn't a superhero who prevents further murders from happening and thus has to face several more dead bodies during his investigation. Even though pretty much performing on automatic pilot, Karloff is terrific and he receives good feedback from the supportive cast. Particularly Marjorie Reynolds is likable as the obtrusive yet helpful gossip reporter Bobby Logan. Recommended in case you have 70 minutes to spare.",
         "The Mr. Wong series borrows somewhat from the Torchy Blane series at Warner Bros., i.e. feisty female reporter annoying the police officer/boyfriend, but also key to solving the crime. A comment was made elsewhere about that character here having a \"Lois Lane\" moment. Torchy Blane was allegedly the inspiration for the Lois Lane character of Superman comics. A humorous, but probably unintentional, mistake shows up early in the film when Boris Karloff's darkening makeup is forgotten on his neck, giving him a two-tone head. Although one can disparage Karloff for these films, keep in mind that film actors then, as now, need and want work. There are plenty of other well-experienced actors appearing in the Mr. Wong films, whom you can see in better films at better studios in the 1930s, or even in later films. Although Karloff was making \"B\" films at Monogram and Columbia around this time, at least he had an \"up\" blip in his career when he played a major role in \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" on Broadway from 1941 to 1944. This film is no worse than the formulaic TV series we have now, both comedy and drama, TV now being today's equivalent of the \"B\" movies of yesterday.",
         "A trio of familiar faces reunites in this engaging Mr. Wong mystery - Boris Karloff as the Chinese Detective, Grant Withers as San Francisco Police Captain Bill Street (though he was \"Sam\" Street in the first two Wong films), and Marjorie Reynolds as feisty Herald newspaper reporter Bobbie Logan. Street \"unofficially\" seeks Wong's help in solving the murder of friend and fellow detective Dan Grady, who was working on a smuggling detail - \"Smuggling and San Francisco mean the Orient\". Besides Grady, the bodies pile up rather quickly in this whodunit; by the time the film is over there are a total of four corpses. The action moves back and forth between Frank Belden Sr.'s jewelry shop, the Neptune Club owned by a shady \"Hardway\" Harry Lockett (Frank Puglia), and the apartment of Belden's financier John Forbes (Charles Trowbridge). Thrown in for good measure are Belden's son Frank Jr. (Craig Reynolds), who has a thing for mysterious vamp Tanya Serova (Lita Chevret). Except for the young Frank Belden, who's acting is a bit forced and over the top, the rest of the cast are all mixed up in the smuggling scheme that Wong rather handily solves by piecing together details involving radio control technology and a rigged telephone call. As we've seen before, Captain Street comes across as a brash blow-hard, but he gets his comeuppance rather nicely at the hands of reporter Logan at the end of the film. With both Wong and Street at the mercy of Forbes' gun, Bobbie uses an ashtray to fake her own weapon and trick the villain into submission, after which Mr. Wong dials up the Herald with the news - \"Oh yes, this is a scoop.\"",
         "Let me start by saying that I love these good ol' mystery flicks from the 40's. They're usually nice a short, filled with decent acting and predictable plot lines. While this did only run a mere 68 minutes, and the actors were as good as usual, I must say I was rather surprised at the outcome. Great twist in what I had pegged as a predictable film. The characters were all great, though I can't quite buy Karloff as a Chinaman. Grant Withers was great as the typical hard-boiled cop, though I must say this particular cop was more flustered than most, providing some fun comic relief. The trademark female reporter was pretty good here as well, played by the beautiful Marjorie Reynolds. If you're a fan of this kind of movie, I highly recommend it. Better than most! 8/10",
         "Now here's a good mystery film starring Boris Karloff as Inspector Wong, 'the Chinese Copper' as one non-PC character calls him. Here, he's helping out the San Francisco police track down the killer of an undercover cop, who's been killed while working for a smuggling racket. Wong teams up with Detective Street and a journalist named Logan (well, she always snooping around at least) and heads off to the place the copper was last seen � The Neptune Bar. The owner of the bar, Hard Way Harry, is a wise guy who looks like he did for the copper, but there are other spanners in the works � A piece of jade Wong finds leads him to a jeweller who's in debt, and who's son is hanging around the Neptune Bar with a piece of skirt Hard Way Harry knows. At first I was scratching my head trying to understand what was going on (and spending a lot of time wondering what age Jason Robards would be when he appeared � turned out it was his dad�I'm so stupid), but then things start to gel as the killer started taking out some witnesses and what not. So Wong's got a race against time to find out who the killer actually is (the killer even kills a guy at the police station) - eventually he figures it out, but even then he might be too late as the killer has figured him out too! This quick moving thriller was a lot of fun to watch, as there's plenty of red herrings, twists, and suspenseful noir-ish set pieces to enjoy. A nice surprise, this one, as I expected to be a bit bored (it's another non-horror included in Mill Creek's 50 Horror Classics - essential for folks curious about old films). There's your plug, Mill Creek - send money to Bezenby, 12 Biscuit Island, Button Moon.",
         "After a number of Mr. Wong detective movies, Boris Karloff's performance as a \"Chinese copper\" is a smooth transition in believing Karloff is Chinese. The battling twosome of Captain Street and Reporter Bobbie Logan returns as usual. Because of the number of mysteries solved by Mr. Wong, Street seeks out the detective in solving the murder of Street's friend and fellow cop, Dan O'Grady. A level head is needed in solving this mystery. Numerous clues appear and only Wong can see them. Of course, this will occur only if Wong can survive till the end of the movie. For once, the female reporter Logan saves the lives of both of the men. A good movie to watch if you like a mystery.",
         "Neither of the six films in the Mr Wong series are great but they are entertaining enough. The Fatal Hour does drag a fair bit, the photography could have done with a little more finesse and while he is much better than he is in Mr Wong in Chinatown Grant Withers overacts, shouting his lines too much. I didn't find it a bad film at all and found it an improvement over Mr Wong in Chinatown. The sets and lighting are effective enough, the music is jaunty and eerie and the dialogue has good doses of humour and thoughtfulness. The story is not as predictable as it sounds, the murders are not particularly creative but the plotting is diverting, fills the short running time very well and the twists and red herrings add to the intrigue and fun(personally I didn't find it that convoluted) though would have been more effective with a brisker pace. The Fatal Hours also is one of the better acted films in the series. Boris Karloff regardless of reservations of authenticity is very magnetic and gives a dignified and thoughtful performance. Marjorie Reynolds is very sassy with the humour coming naturally to her, she and Withers do have some good chemistry. The supporting cast is one of the stronger and more consistent ones of the series, Robert Puglia is the standout as the film's most interesting character and Craig Reynolds also injects life and humour to things. In conclusion, not great but better than expected. 7/10 Bethany Cox",
         "What will you find in and around an oceanside watering hole called The Neptune Club? A little jewel smuggling, a little multiple murder and a whole lot of red herrings. San Francisco policeman Bill Street (Grant Withers) teams up with Chinese super sleuth James Lee Wong (Boris Karloff) to get to the bottom of things. This involves weeding through an almost never-ending parade of suspects to find out which one is going around murdering those who threaten to expose a back room crime operation. And there may, or may not, be more to it than meets the eye. And you may, or may not, even be interested in even viewing this creaky old chestnut. The first ten/fifteen minutes don't exactly do an adequate job of reeling the viewer in, but the film does pick up speed and becomes more interesting (and entertaining) after awhile. Though listed as a horror-mystery, this is more of a mystery with a slightly higher body count than usual, a few shadowy horror movie-like touches (particularly a hand brandishing a pistol emerging from a dark corner of the bar) and, of course, the presence of horror legend Karloff. It's entirely set bound; I don't recall a single scene taking place outdoors, though there is frequent mention of a harbor, shipping docks and a secret passageway we never get to see. It's also incredibly talky, with very little on-screen action. There's no style, no visual flourishes and the camera-work itself is strictly of the point-and-shoot variety. However, the dialogue isn't too bad and neither are the characters. The film also has a sense of humor; namely Marjorie Reynolds as a plucky reporter who annoys the heck out of the fuzz by showing up at every crime scene unannounced but still manages to uncover many of the important clues. Withers' aggressive, reactionary, often-screaming policeman is almost perfectly balanced out by Karloff's smooth, observant and very patient oriental detective. The supporting cast is mostly decent; particularly Frank Puglia as the shady owner of the Neptune Club. Still, I wouldn't go out of my way to see this unless you're a Karloff completist or enjoy creaky lightweight rainy day murder mysteries. There are worse ways to pass an hour or your time. This was either the fourth or fifth entry in the Wong series; Karloff played the same character in MR. WONG, DETECTIVE (1938), MR. WONG IN CHINATOWN (1939), THE MYSTERIOUS MR. WONG (1939) and DOOMED TO DIE (1940).",
         "The Fatal Hour finds the Chinese scholarly detective James Lee Wong as played by Boris Karloff helping the police the murder of a colleague of Captain Grant Withers. In all the Wong mysteries Withers has absolutely no shame in requesting and getting help from his Oriental colleague. Before the 68 minute running time of The Fatal Hour is over we've got three more murders and being this is a Monogram Studios Production the number of folks who could be the culprits falls drastically low. And Marjorie Reynolds is still forever trying to use boyfriend Withers to obtain yet another Lois Lane type scoop for her newspaper. The deceased cop was on the smuggling task force of the San Francisco PD and Wong's investigation takes him to a respected jewelry store in the Bay City as well as the waterfront. By the time the film ends it can only be one of three suspects and I think you'll have figured it out before it's over. It's a Monogram Picture so take it for what it is worth."
