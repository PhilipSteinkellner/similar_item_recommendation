         "I make no apologies for saying that Busby Berkeley's incredible sequence to \"The Lullaby of Broadway\" is one of the most beautiful, chilling, and exuberant moments in the history of American cinema. Not only is the number amazing from a visual standpoint, but is a fantastic illustration of urban isolationism, and attitudes of \"The Great Depression.\" Dreamlike and hypnotic, the song easily seduces the moviegoer as its short character study takes flight, then leaves its viewers in a bizarre state of discomfort as its story takes an abrupt and disturbing turn. I know it's cliched, but they really don't make 'em quite like this anymore!",
         "The GOLD DIGGERS OF 1935 converge on a resort hotel and get involved in staging a lavish charity stage show. With this film, Busby Berkeley, Warner Bros.' genius choreographer, produced another tuneful, eye-popping spectacle to beguile Depression audiences out of their spare change. With some gutsy performers unhampered by anything remotely resembling an intelligent plot, Berkeley provided plenty of laughs & glitz in this follow-up to his popular GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933. The large cast is all attuned to the nonsensical merriment. Preppy Dick Powell is in excellent good voice as the hotel employee wooing rich girl Gloria Stuart, who only has to look lovely for the cameras. Alice Brady is properly shrill & strident as a miserly millionaire insistent on getting her own way in all things. Hugh Herbert is delightful as a daffy fellow interested only in his collection of snuff boxes. Hilarious Adolphe Menjou steals his every scene as a penniless Russian impresario who is obviously slightly crazed. Bold & brassy, the marvelous Glenda Farrell gets to play the only true gold digger in the film. Frank McHugh is Brady's son, desperate to enjoy a forbidden romance. Grant Mitchell oozes unctuous charm as the somewhat smarmy hotel manager. Movie mavens will recognize Nora Cecil as the head hotel housekeeper & E. E. Clive as Herbert's chauffeur, both uncredited. While the cast is all shamelessly willing to entertain, it is the two production numbers near the film's climax which have given it its place in movie history. �The Words Are In My Heart,' with its gorgeous girls and hypnotically undulating white pianos, showcases Berkeley's love for regimented precision & choreography, engendered years before during his stint with the military. The seminal �Lullaby Of Broadway' is a perfect example of Berkeley's way of telling a story through music & dance--in this instance the tale of a Big City girl's ultimately horrific night. These two completely different numbers are tied together by the skein of Berkeley's genius and counterpoint each other beautifully.",
         "While the stars of this film Dick Powell,Gloria Stuart,Adolphe Menjou And the vocal by Wini Shaw all were very good, it was Busby Berkeley's film.Many say it was his finest effort, and stands alone today.His production number \"Lullaby of Broadway\" will never be duplicated again. There were over 100 dancers that took part in it with absolute precision,none of them ever missed a step.Hollywood could not produce such a film today, the talent is just not there. And Dick Powell and Gloria Stuart had a cute little number, in \"I'm going shopping with you\". The other production number \"The words are in my heart\" with 56 miniature pianos also great.",
         "GOLD DIGGERS OF 1935 (Warner Brothers, 1935), directed by Busby Berkeley, is a lavish musical set in New England's Wentworth Plaza, a summer fashionable hotel, featuring a cross section of people working or staying there, many wanting to make some extra money for themselves, hence the title \"Gold Diggers.\" In this edition, the \"Gold Digging\" is done by both men and women, with the exception of the romantic leads. Dick Curtis (Dick Powell), a desk clerk working his way through medical school, is engaged to marry Arline Davis (Dorothy Dare), employed as a the hostess there. Guests at the swank hotel include Ann Prentiss (Gloria Stuart), the daughter of the ultra wealthy but stingy widow Matilda Prentiss (Alice Brady), who wants Ann to marry eccentric middle-aged millionaire, T. Mosley Thorpe (Hugh Herbert), but before Ann will commit herself into a loveless marriage, she wants to go out and enjoy herself first. Mother Prentiss consents to this, but with protection, by hiring Dick as her escort. In the meantime, Arline becomes interested in Humbolt (Frank McHugh), Ann's girl-chasing brother with four previous marriages. While Mosley gets time away from Ann to write a book about snuff, he is pursued by Betty Hawes (Glenda Farrell), a gold-digging stenographer. More complications ensue when the freeloading Nikolai Nicoleff (Adolphe Menjou), a Russian theatrical producer mooching off the hotel, is asked by the manager, Louis Lamson (Grant Mitchell) to stage a musical show that will not only help pay for his bill, but to help benefit the Charity Milk Fund. Sponsored by Mrs. Prentiss, she wants everything in the show to be \"small and cheap.\" With all this is set aside, the real entertainment begins with two lavish production numbers choreographed by Busby Berkeley. With the score by Harry Warren and Al Dubin, GOLD DIGGERS OF 1935 opens instrumentally to \"I'm Going Shopping With You,\" where employees, including bellboys and chambermaids, musically preparing the hotel for the upcoming guests. The song is later introduced by Powell as he escorts Stuart on a shopping spree, charging everything to her mother. This is later followed by the tender love song, \"The Words Are In My Heart\" sung by Powell to Stuart on the motor boat. For the charity show, the first number is \"The Words Are In My Heart\" introduced by Powell to Stuart in period clothes, followed by a parade of chorus girls playing the tune while sitting on movable white pianos. An excellent number that needs to be seen to be appreciated. When one thinks Berkeley cannot outdo that piano segment, stay tuned for the 14 minute finale, \"The Lullaby of Broadway.\" Sung by Winifred Shaw, the big climax of hundreds of dancers in the night club sequence is an instant classic. This segment alone is usually clipped into movie documentaries, especially a segment into public television's 1971 90-minute presentation of \"The Movie-Crazy Years,\" a look back into the history of Warner Brothers movies of the 1930s. \"The Lullaby of Broadway\" went on to win the Academy Award as best song of the year. While \"Shopping\" and \"Words\" are underscored throughout the story, with insert of \"Tango Del Rio\" from WONDER BAR (1934), only \"Lullaby of Broadway\" gives indication of one being inserted here from another movie or musical short, considering the fact that the song isn't heard at all until its grand finale, thus saving the best for last. In closing, GOLD DIGGERS OF 1935 is grand scale musical showing that Berkeley handles his production numbers better than the weak plot. Alice Brady's character can often be annoying while the Warners reliables of Frank McHugh and Hugh Herbert tend to strain a bit for laughs. For character acting, Adolphe Menjou acquires a thick Russian accent to match with his comedic moments opposite Joseph Cawthorne as another heavily accented August Schultz. Distributed to home video in 1989, and DVD many years later as part of the Busby Berkeley collection, GOLD DIGGERS OF 1935 often plays on cable television's Turner Classic Movies. (***)",
         "\"Golddiggers of 1935\" stars Alice Brady as a cheapskate determined that her daughter will marry a wealthy older man as planned. In order to make sure this happens, she gives her daughter a last wish as a single woman, which is to let her do what she wants (i.e., have fun) all summer at the resort where they're staying. So mom hires the student doctor at the reception desk, Dick (Dick Powell) to escort her around. Oh, and then there's the show for the milk fund. And what a show! The daughter in question is the beautiful Gloria Stuart, who a mere 60+ years later will receive an Oscar nomination for \"Titanic\" and make it at last! 96 at the time of this writing, Stuart today is completely recognizable as that dazzling blond of her youth. There's no mistaking those incredible eyes or wonderful voice. It was really a treat to see her in this. The film is remarkable for its milk fund numbers only - the rest of it isn't much. Berkeley pulled out all the stops with a mesmerizing array of moving white pianos played by chorus girls in gowns, and follows it up with \"Lullaby of Broadway.\" Sensational - so imaginative, dark, and atmospheric, truly one of the best numbers in cinema. Its unusual beginning (also done at the end) will cue you in immediately that you're about to see something different. The cast is first rate - Powell, Stuart, Brady, Hugh Herbert, Dorothy Dare, Glenda Farrell, and Adolphe Menjou. Parts of it are overacted, almost as if the actors were on stage, but you won't be sorry you saw Berkeley's work at its best.",
         "Seventy-three years have elapsed since this Gold Diggers movie was released, and it is well worth remembering that for many Americans The Great Depression was still fairly well depressing. Two years into the first administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the overall level of unemployment was dropping, but entirely too many people were what we would now call \"underemployed.\" They were working -- like the hotel staff in the fictional resort where all of the events in this movie occur -- \"for tips.\" Not only that, they were required to pay their managers 'a tithe' of whatever they collected. All of that is laid out in the first sequences of this incredible film. In a very real way, this movie was an employment bonanza all its own. The extraordinary dancing sequences in \"Lullaby Of Broadway\" clearly required about a hundred dancers and the musicians: this means that there were also dozens of supporting personnel required for the task of doing rehearsals ( including musicians ). Perhaps it wasn't the best pay-day for most of these people but it was a pay-day in Hollywood. Busby Berkeley has received many accolades for his work in 42nd Street, which is quite possibly one of the greatest American films ever made. But the energy and style and the enthusiasm which is on display in the dancing routines for \"Lullaby\" was not faked. Maybe this movie has all the intellectual 'nutrients' of cotton candy and maybe that's a valid criticism, but it was work and honest work at that. This is a greatly entertaining film built out of the flimsiest of dramatic components, yet one thing remains true, it's a hell of an entertaining ride. The comedic elements were clearly drawn comic-book style, and I do not find that objectionable in the least, for the goofiness of the lead comic actors is still charming all these decades later. OK, it is true that many millions of modern film fans may not have the slightest idea what 'snuff' is -- finely powdered tobacco -- but funny is funny, and the obsession of the screwball expert who is collecting them is still really funny !! If it wasn't funny, then why are 'nerds' still getting laughs in movies today ?? It's the same basic kind of humor. The rating of 8 for this film does take into account the tissue-thin plot for this second \"Gold Diggers\" episode, but it remains one of my personal favorites and that is said after having given it several viewings. Look back on this as an historical document. See how people behaved before being constantly tethered to their cell phones, before being obsessed with 'global warming' or the price of gasoline. Oh, and Gloria Stuart is so incredibly beautiful that she stops the action in almost every scene she's in, as does Wini Shaw's singing. A great film for a cozy Saturday night, and it is also certified as being 100 % zombie-free.",
         "Who cares if this plot has been seen before, and/or how many times? There is pure magic in this film, and the magic is the production number, \"LULLABY OF Broadway\". This picture deserves classic status for that number. It starts with the very affecting voice of a woman singing right to the audience. We are treated to an elderly Fred-and-Ginger type of dancing which, in spite of the ages of the dancers, is one of the smoothest, slickest, thrillingly romantic dance sequences you'll ever see. Then there is the tippy, tappy magic of ALL those dancers, tapping their way onto the screen. There is no better production number ever to appear in any movie. (I am allowed exaggeration; I am Sicilian). Do yourself a great favor and see this dance number.",
         "Three production numbers with the finale being the apotheosis of group tap dancing. The 'Lullaby of Broadway' production number will probably never be duplicated. If one considers the time when this musical was produced, the effect of the Winifred Shaw special(Dick Powell actually finishes off the song)is a wonderful example of encapsulating the fast paced life of the Broadway of the 30's. \"I'm Going Shopping With You\" is a catchy tune but not of classic standards. Still the production of this number is entertaining. \"The Words Are In My Heart\" does not start out well when first introduced by Dick Powell while sitting in the parked speedboat. Notice the strain on his voice in the line '. . .the moon above makes the mu-sic'. Very strident. He improves on this when he gets an opportunity to sing it again. '. . mu-sic' is much less strained. The production of this number with the pianos, however, is extremely enjoyable. The pianos seem to glide effortlessly across the floor and manage to mesh perfectly. Remember, this was done before computers and much hydraulic equipment. So how was this accomplished? If one looks closely under the pianos nearest the screen, unmistakably you will see a pair of black trousered legs propelling the outline of each piano as it glides into place. Imagine the hours of preparation and drill it took to perform this feat to produce the effect seen on the screen. That's how it was in the Depression 30's. This writer must confess that the visibility of the trousers was not noticeable until pointed out on a program discussing the film within the last couple of years. It certainly was not noticeable to the 12-year old who was fortunate enough to view this classic when it first appeared in the middle of the Depression 30's. These musicals helped to make the Depression bearable.",
         "Caught this one on TCM the other night. Good music, lots of beautiful girls and an inane plot, humorously acted out by a talented cast. What more could anyone ask for? This is what the \"movies\" were all about when life outside the theater was in the middle of the Great Depression. You might be making 25 bucks a week and probably forked over a quarter to see this picture. For your money you were able to forget your troubles as you watched the Busby Berkeley dance numbers and listened to the tunes of Harry Warren and Al Dubin. Not a bad deal then and still enjoyable now on cable, video or DVD. It seems to me that the actors of that era had more talent than most of those plying the craft these days. I also like the cast introductions, common to the era, showing a brief moment from the film, portraying the introduced in a flattering way. Style and class unfortunately seem to be in short supply in most films of the present era which has become much more concerned with finding new ways to shock or offend us as they happily take our money (9 bucks?). Sure, there were better examples of the 1930s musical genre but this one really ain't all that bad. You could do worse than sit down and watch.",
         "In 1935 with the country in the midst of the Depression this kind of escapist entertainment is just what the public wanted. And the studio best equipped to give it to them was Warner Brothers. The Brothers gave complete creative control to Busby Berkeley having him direct the whole film instead of just the musical numbers. And the talented Mr. Berkeley hit one big home run with this. Back during the late sixties when the nostalgia craze was going on Warner Brothers re-released this and Footlight Parade back in the cinema. It was quite the treat for me to see this first on the silver screen as it was for my parents and grandparents. You never worry about plot or story in these films, they're just an excuse to plant musical numbers in the film. What plot there is involves tightfisted dowager Alice Brady both financing a charity show at a favorite summer resort hotel of her's. She's brought her two children along, the beautiful Gloria Stuart and the idiot drunken son Frank McHugh. She's worried about some gigolo sweeping Stuart away as so many women have done with McHugh so she hires hotel clerk/medical school student Dick Powell to escort her. I think you can figure out the rest. But we also have from the Warner's stock company Hugh Herbert as another eccentric millionaire staying there and goldigging stenographer Glenda Farrell and Dorothy Dare a goldigging clerk who respectively land their intended targets. But borrowed from his usual haunts at MGM is Adolphe Menjou who steals the acting honors in a scenery chewing performance as a hammy Russian theatrical director who's a deadbeat chiseler as well. This film should be watched for him alone. Harry Warren and Al Dubin contributed three songs for this film. Dick Powell sings The Words are in my Heart and I'm Going Shopping With you. But the real hit song was done by Wini Shaw in the huge production finale. I'm speaking of Lullaby of Broadway which won the second Best Song Oscar given out. it's Busby Berkeley at his surreal best."
