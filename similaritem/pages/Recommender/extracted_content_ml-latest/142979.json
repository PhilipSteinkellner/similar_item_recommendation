         "An aesthetically beautiful film, this Taiwanese export is perfectly shot and lit, with every scene being photo-worthy. Darkly twisted, with an emphasis on the supernatural, we follow a hit-man who's being haunted by the spirits of those he has killed, on his quest to rid himself of the spirits who just won't leave him alone. He is joined by Lin, a psychic, who aids him in his journey, which sees them confront his old employer and the police.",
         "THE LAUNDRYMAN is a quirky Taiwanese thriller with a mix of genres and styles. It's a bright and vibrant looking film about a hitman who works as a laundyman and low-grade worker by day and assassin by night. His problems arise when he finds himself haunted by the ghosts of his victims and he turns to others for aid in getting rid of them. The comedy is of the quirky style, but the characters are largely appealing and the actors work hard to make the story come across well. There are directorial flourishes and fight scenes aplenty, as well as some very dark and violent moments that you wouldn't see in a comedy from any other region."
