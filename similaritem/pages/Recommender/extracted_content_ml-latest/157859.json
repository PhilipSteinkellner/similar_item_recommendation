      "reviews": ["I have been debating if I should bring my 7-year-old niece who still believes in tooth fairy to watch this. Yes it is funny and comical and leads you into fantasy. It also brings you hope as a burglar has a kind heart. But if you bring a kid who still believes in Santa Claus to see this film, you might kill his/her imagination. After all it is light, heartwarming and quite a feel good movie. If you are still young at heart you surely would enjoy it. The story unfolds on Christmas Eve when 6-year-old Antoine (Victor Cabal) goes to bed after dinner, hoping to ride with Santa Claus on his sleigh to see his father. Naturally Antoine is stunned when Santa Clause (Tahar Rahim) appears on his balcony, thinking Santa is on his way distributing presents. Little does the boy know that the bearded guy is really a burglar, trying his luck at luxurious Parisian apartments. Determined to be his apprentice, Antoine follows Santa on his mission and the duo embarks on an adventure on Paris rooftops. But Antoine gradually realizes this man may not be Santa he expects. The story ends with a warm note and a moral. It is as satisfying as reading an elaborate moving picture book for children, except this is for the young at heart. Well, why does it matter? Let's all be young and innocent in this time of the year and just enjoy the flow. Great acting from both actors and you really feel the bonding and the different emotions. Little Victor is so cuuute! Paris at night is, of course, forever romantic. Merry Christmas to all and have a great holiday."],
