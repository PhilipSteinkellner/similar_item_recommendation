         "For a made for TV movie I thought that it was a great popcorn movie - don't expect anything to be very accurate and don't expect any award winners in this bunch but I do recommend this for a TV type version somewhat like \"The Replacements\". Look for cameos from real NFL players & officials.",
         "In the year 2000 (keep in mind, this is two years ago, not four), two men had the motivation to create the most miraculous piece of art on this side of the Mississippi. Thanks to Jere Cunningham and Tom Flynn, the world can now enjoy Second String, a delicious TV movie depicting a tale of a rag-tag gang of second stringers (thus the title) who are thrust into the position of starters due to an order of bad oysters. Because of the motivational direction of both the director Robert Lieberman and the Buffalo Bills' last minute QB, Dan \"Give 'em hell\" Heller (portrayed by Canadian actor, Gil Bellows) the oft Super Bowl snake-bitten Bills find themselves in the ultimate position. With an intriguing mix of internal and external conflict, a love story, comraderie that only the fine sport of football can bring, and an overall theory that the underdog can compete, Second String is an excellent movie worthy of viewing every possible moment that it appears on TNT. The only thing potentially bad about this production is the spelling of the Costume Designer's first name, Jenifur Jarvis.",
         "I may be biased on this as I am a huge Buffalo Bills fan. However, the \"gem\" of this movie is not where most people would think. The gem in this movie is how Dan Heller won over his teammates with his leadership. If I were teaching how to manage people, this film would be required viewing by every single student in the class. At first, he thinks his chance is totally zero, but then one fluke incident - and he's basically the CEO of the on-field team. Instead of just going in and saying \"I'm Dan Heller - I'm the guy and do what I say\" - he takes the time to learn about his \"second string\" and why they are on the second string. You come to find out that just about every one of them would be stars on any other team, but for one reason or another - they ended up on the second string. His butt is pulled out of the fire by his wife who believes in him more than he does and his long time friend Jerry who gives him a huge lecture after they barely win the first playoff game. What struck me was after that talk with Jerry, he takes the time to really dig in and learn about his teammates - and he goes the extra mile to make them a lot better. He works out in a graveyard with the running back helping him to learn cutback moves. When he finds out his left tackle can't tackle the play book, he learns what is required of that position on every play and then tells the guy what to do on every play - just like he had it in high school and college. They work overtime ( night practices ) with new plays he draws up just for them that he knew would work with their talents. He reaches out to every player, even \"Ernie Weathers\" - the grizzly veteran with a chip on his shoulder so large, it takes the last play of the Super Bowl to remove it. Ernie doesn't get it until Dan tells him - \"What if we do win and you had nothing to do with it? - how would you feel knowing you didn't do a thing to earn it\". That finally gets Ernie thinking and he makes the winning move on the last play of the game to win it. He even wins over the coach who admits to him that he was never given a chance because the coach didn't want him because he didn't fit \"his system\". Even when he's pulled for someone who is supposedly better for the Super Bowl, its quite obvious to all of the players who made them better - and why. When things start to go wrong in the big game and even then he tries to explain it to the new guy, the new guy doesn't want to listen worth a crap. Thus, his teammates mutiny, knock the \"3 time SB champ\" out with a head butt, and they put Dan back in. And that my friends is the ultimate gem that many managers need to learn - you adjust for the players you have, not what you want your players to do. This is true for any workplace - and not just sports. I personally have been in great work situations and horrid ones, and the great ones follow what Dan does to the letter and the horrid ones follow the lead of \"Tommy\". I personally worked for a guy in one situation who had a cast of people who on paper weren't up to the challenge - but every day he told them they were - and although I can't give more details - I will tell you that 20,000+ jobs were saved because of his effort. You know when you're working for Dan, you know when you're working for Tommy, hopefully there are enough Dan's where you are who keep the Tommy's at bay or even keep them out of the company. So to the writer of this movie, you have a gem - if you want to make a lot more money for this film, license it to a \"Dan\" who can use it to make better managers.",
         "Being a Bills fan, I originally found it annoying that they made a movie about the Bills and the losing of four superbowls. But once I began to watch, I felt really connected. It was actually nice to see the \"Bills\" win the superbowl, and I must say, that for a TV movie it was actually very well done. Gil Bellows as the QB, and Jon Voight as the old-school Coach did a very fine job. 8 out of 10",
         "Well intended and interesting, especially for football fans. The Buffalo Bill's offensive starters are side lined by food poisoning. It is now up to the bench warmers to take the team to the play offs. A glory hound coach(Jon Voight)is not thrilled with his replacement quarterback(Gil Bellows)a former NFL star relegated to selling life insurance. Bellows not only has his former coach to contend with, but also an egotistical free agent quarterback(George Eades). Bellows takes the bench jockeys and meshes them into a contending team. Supporting cast:Richard T. Jones, Lamont Johnson,Teri Polo and Evan Dexter Parke. Very entertaining trick plays keeps this daydream between the lines. This is fun to watch.",
         "Craptastic! This movie is as wonderfully predictable as it is cheesy. Primarily because the characters are fairly enjoyable. Set your expectations low and you will not be disappointed. This is not a rip-off of \"The Replacements\" it is far superior. Instead of watching a bunch scabs, (the lowest life form on the planet-read Jack London's definition of a scab), the audience is treated to a much more inventive, though highly improbable, reason as to why the the starting squad is not available to play football. The story takes you away with groans and yeah rights. Chances are you will laugh out loud at the contrivances and trickery. On an added note of actual production value. The cinematography is actually pretty awesome during the game play, especially since the budget was far less than an actual feature film. Not worth renting, not worth planning to watch, but definitely worth your time. I would have much rather seen this whilst trapped on a plane than The Replacements.",
         "One of the better \"underdog\" sports movies. Voigt is strong and believable. Bellows is good but as others noted, T Polo's character is shallow and forgettable, like her contrived performance (her lines are strained) G Eads is better here than on CSI and he gets big points for making the viewers dislike him. Even though its predictable, this is much better than \"The Replacements\" and other films with this premise. Worth watching? you bet.",
         "A delightful little movie about getting a second chance. No real BIG names except Jon Voight of course. Perfect for the small screen. The cameos by the real players were well done and not too hammy. Football fans will enjoy the \"trick\" plays.",
         "The nice thing about this down-to-earth-hosed-over-qb-wins-the-big-one film is that your wife doesn't walk into the room just as a very foul word comes pouring out of the tv set. In fact, she'll enjoy it with you because there are no drugs, outrageous sex, or make-me-sick-and-shudder bone crunching neck snapping hits ala \"Any Given Sunday\" happening here. Jon Voight starts off as the despicable coach one can't help but detest (pompous control freak), but he then surprises you by confessing his shortcomings to the miracle game winning 4th string qb he cut from a previous team, realizing that loose cannon (improvising) qbs CAN win games, ala Johnny Unitas, Fran Tarkenton, and Doug Flutie. It is not deep, but definitely predictable, and is still a watchable, easy going, low-paid-guys-with-heart-DO-win, kind of dvd rental. This NOT Ben Hur! A good rainy day at home or drivein (good luck) film. Don't think so hard. Relax.",
         "We just got \"Second String\" on video today, and I always the sucker for underdog movies, and after reading the synopsis on the box, decided to check it out. I was rather impressed by this small release (we only got two copies in). Now, I too, got the whole \"Replacements-wannabe\" vibe that several of the other reviewers may have had. However, I really got into this one a lot more. I thought it had a much better, and more importantly, believable story to it than the \"Replacements\" did. I thought Voight did a much better job than Hackman ever did as the old coach. Bellows was great as the QB, and since his 5-year stint on TV, its great to see he's making a comeback. I particularly liked when Bellows helped out his teammates with their physical and mental aspects of their game. While other movies have done this several times over, \"Second String\" doesn't have that corny feeling that is left over for the viewer to digest. Instead, it adds a little humor into it. I chuckled a few times as the players were counting up how much their running-back would pay up for the Superbowl party everytime he dropped the football. If you manage to find this treasure somewhere in the back of our store and are trying to avoid some of the more recent blockbusters that have been released, try giving it a chance. I'm sure you'll be quite impressed.",
         "** mild spoilers within ** Your level of enjoyment in watching this film will depend to a large degree on how you watch it. The casual football fan who has not seen too many underdog sports films will probably find it enjoyable. As someone who has seen many of the countless similarly-themed films, I thought it was OK, but nothing new (and nothing that had not been done better elsewhere). Someone who follows the Bills and knows their history of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory may be amused by the way the plot line overlaps with some of the more angst-ridden moments in Bills history (everything but O.J.). Scott Norwood and the Music City Miracle both come in to play. One ironic component of the film is that the Bills (and Doug Flutie) qualify to play the Chargers in the playoffs. In the off-season after the movie was shot, Flutie left the Bills for the Chargers, and a lot of bad blood flowed between the teams as the result of some back-office dealings. The script contained holes that were obvious to someone with a more than casual interest in the game. There were some subtle and not-so-subtle flaws in the way the games played out--some decisions just would not have been made as they were in the film. There was also a shocking lack of media hype surrounding the NFL post-season (not that there's anything wrong with that, but it takes away from the realism). Any athlete in Heller's shoes would be surrounded by reporters at every turn (which would have provided an opportunity to explore his ambivalence and growth through the film). My main problem with the film is that the story line reflects a less than thorough understanding of the game. The subtle flaws and relentless plays on Bills historical references pulled me out of the mood and flow of the story. There was very little original content, and since the plot was pretty predictable, the way the story moves from point A to point B should be cleaner. Overall, the film was watchable, but nothing special. I saw it in the middle of a sports film marathon on cable, though, and I found most of the other movies more compelling.",
         "This was a good football movie, it showed whats its like to be at the bottom of the ladder on a football team, and then be thrust into the starting roll. I really liked the idea that it had an overall bigger lession to teach as well.",
         "(SPOILERS) This movie was watchable, but not very good. My main problem with the film was the uncanny resemblance to the movie \"The Replacements,\" starring Gene Hackman et al. This becomes most apparent in the final game, the Super Bowl. Every aspect of the game mirrors the final game in \"The Replacements.\" They even ripped off the whole plot involving a hotshot QB being brought in to win big game, but not listening to the coach. Even some of the dialogue as this QB complains about the second stringers is almost exactly the same. Oh, and the ending (SPOILER) is the same as well. The hotshot QB is sent walking, and replacement player Bellows comes in and brings his team back from the brink of failure to win. Big surprise there. My advice? Rent \"The Replacements.\" Much better.",
         "I thought the movie wasn't too bad, but George's part was too small. His character was a jerk, but it is nice to see that he can play parts other than the studly nice guy! Gil Bellows was good, also. I haven't seen him too much since Ally.",
         "Wow, this movie was horrible. As a Bills fan I was really looking forward to it, but this was bad. They should have left it on the shelf it was on for 4 years. I can't believe a guy like Jon Voight would sign on for something like this.",
         "\"Second String\" is a TNT production released in 2002. Some criticize it as a low-budget variation of 2000's \"The Replacements.\" The story revolves around the Buffalo Bills who hire a star college player who never made it in the pros to help in practice. Dan Heller (Gil Bellows) takes the job because he needs the money and is pressured by his wife (Tori Polo). When the starting line-up of the offense suffers food poisoning, Dan and the other second stringers have to step up and prove themselves. Since this is a TV production, you can't expect the spit and polish of films like 1999's \"Varsity Blues.\" Speaking of which, Jon Voight played the coach in that one too. He's essentially the same character in \"Second String,\" except he's coaching for the NFL and not a high school team, not to mention he's a few notches less malevolent. In any event, Voight more than has the gravitas to pull off the stubborn, pushy coach. Bellows is great as the every-day guy protagonist and Polo shines as his wife. The rest of the cast is good and, despite the low budget, you can tell thought and effort was put into the story and filmmaking, but because of its limitations it's only moderately amusing and fails to achieve the greatness of \"Varsity Blues.\" I was a little let down with the women considering the resources at their disposal; Polo, for instance, is underutilized. Where this movie soars is the underlying message. Heller is thrust into a bound-to-lose situation and must rise to the challenge. As the quarterback, he has to take the reins of leadership and corral the troops, even if they don't want to be corralled or don't think they can win. Heller's humble, but forceful approach to leadership is contrasted with a hireling star quarterback that the coach signs-up for the playoffs, Tommy Baker (George Eads), who thinks he can unite the team and lead them to victory on bluster and bloviating alone. The film runs 100 minutes and was shot in Toronto, Hamilton and Woodbridge, Ontario. GRADE: B",
         "i'm not a bills fan, but this fact did not cloud my judgement. it's just a bad movie. why is it bad? totally unrealistic. first off, the movie started off in the playoffs, that's too short a time. the next thing is referring to the last two games in this movie, the afc championship game and the super bowl. in both games the bills are down 21-0 and win. i know that's not impossible, but here what is: the touchdowns scored by the bills offense. an offensive tackle on a REVERSE throwing a PASS? huh? except for the punt return that won the first game(unlikely in the way that happened too) all the bills scores looked stupid. then there's the old footage of the real nfl throughout the movie. on one clip i saw andre reed, #83, on the field before a game. if you're not going to have the real players in this game, don't show the footage. it ruins the atmosphere of the film. oh, yeah, look at randy moss and terrance shaw of the vikings walk out of the tunnel before the super bowl, then five minutes later see cris cater on the sideline. also, for a super bowl that is played in new orleans, it looked like the h h h metrodome. the one plus was the actual actors acted well. it's just that this movie had too many holes in it. c'mon, the bills and vikings in the super bowl? why, so two super bowl bum win one? please. i also wish they would have mentioned the year this stuper season was taking place in. andre reed hasn't played for the bills since '99, so i'll say '99. doug flutie was ok, gil bellows was cool, jon voight did good(but why is he in this turkey?) but this movie is awful",
         "All y'all hatin' on the fact you'd probably neva make the cut for \"Second String\" need to save it. If more guys out there took their sorry behinds to the gym for once...maybe y'all have a chance....well,...maybe. Take Shawn Woods' \"HOOK\" physique for a \"perfect\" example...and I stress the word \"perfect\" Put that in your pipe and smoke it...!!! You couldn't look better Sha-Shawn",
         "I don't normally write reviews, but this \"film\" was special. I couldn't turn it off. I don't believe I've ever seen a worse movie, but there I sat, watching. It was like a horrible car wreck with blood flowing all over the highway. It was disgusting, but I couldn't turn away. Where do I start? The movie seems to think it's a sports thriller, but it's so utterly ridiculous, it can only be a comedy, but it's not funny, not even in a dumb/silly way. It's like watching your cousins try to act out a skit on family get-togethers. It's painful to watch, but at least it's only for a minute or two. Second String went on for over an hour. Whoever was involved with making this movie should not work again. The writing, directing, acting, and everything was just terrible. The problem is I can't describe how bad it was; you just had to see it. And I'm sure this will NEVER be shown again, so unless you saw it, you're out of luck. I mean it was almost worth seeing just for the fact that it gave me some appreciation for every other \"bad\" film I've seen over my lifetime. And for every film I see in the future that I can't stand, I will think to myself, well, at least it wasn't bad as the Second String."
