         "I think we all have a secret fantasy to show up the police at their job. A movie like Murder She Baked: A Deadly Recipe plays right into that. Also playing into that fantasy were such shows as Murder She Wrote, Mrs. Wainthropp Investigates. And who more than Agatha Christie did that when she created Jane Marple? Alison Sweeney of Days Of Our Lives has created an interesting character in Hannah Swenson, owner of a small town bakery who likes to dabble in police business. She probably gets away with a lot because like Jane Marple her instincts are right. And she bakes such delicious goods no one wants to incarcerate her especially the cops who love her delivery of them to the station. But Sweeney is involved in a bad one. Someone murdered the chief of police in the parking lot of the police station. Ty Olsson who plays the victim was not loved by his staff, is in a campaign for re- election, has a messy personal life, and on top of that is getting close to an auto theft ring that's been plaguing his town. So there's a lot of people who have motives. With Cameron Mathison as one of the deputies who likes Sweeney's instincts and her in general, but gives her some kind of official cover for her own investigations while warning her of the consequences of interfering with police business the two make a good team. I have to say in the end the motive for the slaying was truly bizarre and the perpetrator a pitiable figure. I can't say more other than the perpetrator gives a great and subtle performance. My first exposure to this series of which this is the fourth film made for the Hallmark Channel. Sweeney's character is a winning and an interesting one.",
         "Allison Sweeney and Cameron Mathison star in \"Murder, She Baked: A Deadly Recipe\" on Hallmark channel. In this mystery series, Sweeney plays Hannah Swenson, who owns a bakery, The Cookie Jar, in Lake Eden, Minnesota, and she has a penchant for solving mysteries. This time, it's the town sheriff who has been murdered, and his deputy, Hannah's brother-in-law, is a suspect. Hannah gets to work trying to clear her brother-in-law, but as she does so, she finds herself in danger. All My Children's Cameron Mathison plays Mike, a police officer, who is crazy about Hannah. He has some competition, but it looks like he's winning. This was slow, but okay, with decent acting. The leads are pleasant. One thing I noticed was that not everyone had a Hollywood figure - I guess it was the bakery influence. It's a good influence. For trivia buffs, the director is Kristoffer Tabori, a former actor who is the son of Viveca Lindfors and Don Siegel. Viveca had a stage and film career, and Don Siegel? He directed the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers."

         "The town sheriff is murdered during election time and Hannah the owner of the town bakery teams up with the smitten town dentist to clear her brother-in-law of the crime. All the while the lead detective who is also smitten with Hannah is trying to keep her out of trouble.",
         "In the small town of Eden Lake, Minnesota, tensions are running high in the sheriff's office as it's election time, with incumbent Jim Grant running against Deputy Bill Todd for the Sheriff's position. Historically, Sheriff Grant has taken over the high profile case of the day, solving it just before the election, which has largely led to his election time after time. This time, the case he has taken over, a series of car thefts, was previously led by Bill, who accuses the Sheriff of using his position for his own political gain. Meanwhile, Hannah Swensen, owner/operator of Hannah's Cookie Jar bakery/café and Bill's sister-in-law, is leading a committee to put together a cookbook as a fundraiser, the committee which decides which recipes make it in and which don't. Gary Koehler, who runs the local salvage yard, has submitted his deceased mother's thought to be lost but newly found famous \"perfect\" fudge cupcake recipe. A problem with the recipe as is is that Mrs. Koehler has listed an ingredient solely as a secret one, Hannah who is tasked with figuring out what it is based on her own previous consumption of the cupcakes. One evening when the committee is preparing the recipes for judgment at the community center, Sheriff Grant stops by to put up some campaign posters. Shortly thereafter, Hannah and her very pregnant sister/Bill's wife, Andrea Todd, find Sheriff Grant's dead body outside the center, this the fourth of four times in recent months that Hannah has found the murdered body in town. With Bill being caught on surveillance footage outside the center when he previously said he would be at home, he becomes the primary suspect in the Sheriff's murder. Detective Mike Kingston, one of the two men vying for Hannah's affections (the other being dentist Norman Rhodes), is leading the investigation for the Sheriff's department. Despite Mike's insistence that Hannah not get involved, she, with Norman's help, decides to figure out who killed Sheriff Grant, as she wants to ensure that her imminent niece/nephew has a father who is at home and not in jail. Hannah's attention turns in two directions: Nettie Grant, the Sheriff's widow, as rumors abound that the two had not had a happy marriage ever since the death of their son, then young adult Peter Grant, in a car accident several years earlier; and Paige Miller, the wife of Deputy Kevin Miller, who had open but quiet animosity toward the Sheriff, she who was at the center that evening. As usual, the closer that Hannah gets to the truth, the more her life could potentially be in danger. All the answers may be who is sitting behind the wheel of the black pickup truck that seems to be following her around town."
