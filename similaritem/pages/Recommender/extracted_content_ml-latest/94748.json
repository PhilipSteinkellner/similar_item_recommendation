      "synopsis": "It's 1971. Cathy Rush is a woman ahead of her time ... and she's about to embark on an adventure for the ages. A new era is dawning in the country and in collegiate athletics, where a national champion will be crowned for the first time in women's basketball. In the lead up to this historical season, major universities are preparing their game plans to win that first title. Meanwhile a tiny all-women's Catholic college in Philadelphia has a more modest goal: find a coach before the season begins. Providentially, Cathy Rush is about to find Immaculata College. Recently married, Cathy is dealing with the aftermath of a truncated playing career. While cultural norms would have her staying at home, she's willing to do the hard work necessary to help her new team reach their goalsor perhaps she's just trying to achieve her unfulfilled dreams through them. From the beginning, her challenges are as imposing as the big-school teams Immaculata will face on the court. Cathy learns there is no gymnasium on campus, she receives little support from the school's Mother Superior, and the school is in dire financial straits. To top it off, she may not even have enough players to field a team! While it appears the Macs don't have a prayer, all hope is not lost. With the help of Sister Sundaya spunky assistant coachand the support of a booster club of elderly nuns, Coach Rush creates a new game plan that just might bring the teamand the schooltogether. Will this pioneer buck cultural norms and spur her rag-tag team to unexpected heights? Or will her hard-driving ways create a wedge between the coach and everyone around her? One thing's for certain: there's never been anyone like Cathy Rush at Immaculata! THE MIGHTY MACS is based on the incredible true story of the 1971-72 Immaculata College team that started in obscurity but became the original Cinderella story in women's basketball. This team of pioneers went from barely making that inaugural tournament to the first dynasty in their game. And Cathy Rush, the woman that was ahead of her time, became immortalized when she was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. THE MIGHTY MACS stars Carla Gugino as Cathy Rush; David Boreanaz as her husband, NBA referee Ed Rush; Marley Shelton as Sister Sunday; and Academy Award and Tony Award winner Ellen Burstyn as Mother St. John. The film was written, directed, and produced by Tim Chambers. The film's executive producers are Pat Croce, the former president of the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers, and Vince Curran, a successful businessman and former basketball star at Penn. Curran and Chambers are founders and partners of Quaker Media. Get ready to cheer on a true Cinderella team when THE MIGHTY MACS opens in theaters on October 21.",

         "Based upon the true story of the Immaculata College women's basketball team, it is thoroughly refreshing to see a G-rated film with human actors in it. This values-oriented sports drama has the feel of an older, classic Hollywood film that emphasizes the importance of personal dreams, the will to win, and the need for shared sacrifice to achieve success. These women were at the forefront of everyday women's liberation, depending upon themselves rather than politicians or demonstrations to achieve their goals. Their combined efforts helped to put college women's athletic programs \"on the map\". Later achievements of individual team members in women's athletics, business, non-profit foundations and academia tell us just how special these women really are.",
         "I saw the Mighty Macs in a preview screening tonight, and came away impressed. First, the themes, or messages, of the movie are good ones. The movie is about a small, cash-strapped girls' school that hires a basketball coach who has visions of greatness. She tries to bring the team around to her vision. So the first theme explored is the theme of staying the course, overcoming obstacles and struggling through adversity. That theme is pretty standard fare for these underdog stories, but it is done well here, and it is all the more resonant because the movie is based on a true story. The second theme, as I see it, was about the emergence of women in sports and in life in general, and I liked the way that this theme was presented. Nowadays in movies and in the media I often see the raising up of a woman represented by radical cosmetic makeovers or some other reference to external appearance. In the Mighty Macs, the theater actually laughed when they first saw the girls' uniforms. And in one scene, one of the girls on the team who had very little money was called out by someone outside the team for her rundown clothing. Rather than gang up on her, the team rallied to that girl's help. And rather than getting new uniforms so they could be elevated by the clothes, it was the other way around � their inspired play elevated the uniforms, and now the dowdy uniforms are fondly recalled (I know because we got some nice literature from the school at the screening). Finally, and it's sort of a side note, I liked that there were nuns in the movie, lots of them, and they were not cartoon characters. The movie showed their different personalities; their individuality even amongst their identical appearance, not unlike the team itself. At one point, one of the nuns described her journey toward her vocation, and the treatment of it was entirely respectful. It dignified rather than ridiculed her choice. That should not be remarkable at all, but to me it was, as I almost now expect to see nuns ridiculed. A fine, fun movie for the whole family.",
         "This is a great film!!!! Take the Family !! This was very similar to what happened in my all girls school that I attended in 1960. My whole family loved this film!! I wish there were more films like this one!! The perseverance of the girls and the Mother Superior and also especially the coach is remarkable.We were moved to tears at times. Why can't Hollywood make more movies like this??? Maybe they will wake up and make some classic movies again. We would go to the movies more often if they would make them like this one. There are some independent film makers out there maybe we will see more of these kind of movies lets hope so!! I will be watching to maybe see some change in our movies.",
         "This is a must see show - especially for every woman that thinks she is hitting against all odds and will amount to very little. I hope and wish that, anyone feeling discouraged, they choose to watch this heartfelt movie and be empowered by it. Cathy Rush is to basketball what Clara Barton is to nursing and was truly amazing. Get your young children before this show and let them become inspired by the story of this woman who encouraged her team to grow through believing in their dreams. Every dream may be slightly different on a team, but the end result comes together when a team acts like a true team. Cathy Rush did for women's basketball in a time that it wasn't popular for women basketball teams to exist what the Jody Conradt's, etc. do for the women basketball teams of today -- definitely a woman ahead of her time. Don't worry, if you aren't necessarily a basketball fan, you'll still be amazed because the lessons learned can be applied to just about any area of life.",
         "When you go to a movie and want to get your monies worth you get disappointed more than you used to before. Remember when you could go to a movie without worry of having a great experience? Well, this brings that feeling back! If you like films based on a true story, go see this film! If you want to leave the theater feeling good go see this film! If you want to go to a movie and not feel like you waisted your time, go see this film! If you want to go to the movies and not feel like you waisted a dime, go see this film! If you're tired of not being able to take your kids to the movies take them and GO SEE THIS FILM!",
         "Although in relation to other modern films, it seems a clean and good film, there was one blasphemy that was meant as a joke: A man in a bar hits on the main character and the nun (without her veil), they both indicate that they are \"taken\" and not interested in him. The nun says her Man is a carpenter. \"Good with his hands, is he?\" \"He works miracles,\" she responds with meaning. Of course, the literal reading is benign and true. But the innuendo or other meaning of her phrase and the way she delivers it is impure and, said of the God-Man, it is blasphemous. In another scene, the team is playing against men to improve its basketball skills. The nun pushes her fanny against the \"front-end\" of the man she is guarding in such a way that the man makes a face indicating something is inappropriate. She then spanks him on the bottom. After hearing how absolutely pure this movie was, I didn't appreciate watching this behavior and blasphemy in front of my 11-year-old daughter and her friends.",
         "The Mighty Macs is a sports film that stars Carla Gugino as Cathy Rush, a Hall of Fame women's basketball coach who leads Immaculata College to a national championship in women's basketball during the 70's.Ellen Burstyn,Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz co-stars.It was written and directed by Tim Chambers. The screenplay is based on the incredible true story of the 1971-72 Immaculata College women's basketball team that started from obscurity and win the national championship when Cathy Rush takes a job as the head women's basketball college coach.It tells the story of their training,their struggles and their victory during their first year.Later,the school became a dynasty by winning three straight national championships from 1972 to 1974. It could be classified as generic considering that one won't find anything really refreshing in the movie.Added to that,we get to see some familiar themes and clichés like overcoming the odds,the familiar underdog story and many more.But Gugino gives an good performance that definitely would provide interest in the Mighty Macs' journey to the national victory and her journey as well as a first year coach.As for the action on the court,there is nothing really spectacular except that one would really enjoy the hard work,dedication and determination to overcome the odds they Mighty Macs are facing.Overall,it does not really fall short in entertainment especially for sports fans who love underdog stories.Definitely,a family film.",
         "I lived in Paoli, not far from Immaculata and had seen the campus several times. What Cathy Rush accomplished was amazing at a time when women's college basketball wasn't even on the map. Rush was reasonable attractive but Carla Guggino is much \"hotter\" of course. Acting-wise, she captured Rush's spirit and intensity perfectly. This really is a rare sports story where not only did David beat Goliath to win the big prize but also really did change the game of women's sports and established its importance in real life. And almost all the team members went on to improve their lives and to point to this experience in doing so. The Mighty Macs is a story well worth telling. The fact that this movie, with very modest budget and production values, succeeds in telling the story so well in a fast-paced, entertaining, well-acted, and satisfying way makes it all the most special. Just like the success of the Mighty Macs themselves, the success of this product (not commercial success but its high quality) is a true team effort. Pat, Bruce, Carla, Ellen, and everyone else involved. T-E-A-M TEAM!!! Well done.",
         "The Mighty Macs is a movie that you can bring all of the family to without any worries. You get a view of Catholic Sisters that is truly humorous yet respectful. Although this is the story of Immaculata College's girls basketball team, it is the story of us all. The story of Cathy Rush and Immaculata College is something we can and should relate to - push for your dreams and you will achieve them. Those who dare to dream can make a difference in their own life and the lives of those around them. Do you believe in your dreams? Maybe the story of The Mighty Macs will inspire you to shoot for your goals. Great acting, great action, and an inspiring story with a positive message make this a win, win. Just go see it!",
         "\"It will take an act of God to save this school.\" Cathy Rush (Gugino)is a modern woman in the '70's. Her husband is not working and rather then staying home she decided to go out and get a job coaching at a local all girls catholic school. With no gym, uniforms, a school about to close and a lack of talent she does her best to make the team better then it ever thought it could. I should tell you right off that I am a sucker for sports movies. I will watch pretty much any movie about sports. Most of the sports movies that come out lately are true stories and to me that makes them better. This one is about a small catholic girls school that went from no gym to trying to win the national championship. Not only is this inspiring but it really makes you feel for what the girls had to go through to get there. This is one of the better sports movies I have seen and I highly recommend this to everyone...not just girls. Overall, a great family movie that any parent with a high school girl who is unsure of herself should watch. I give it an A."
