         "Arnon Goldfinger's most recent documentary The Flat (best documentary awards at the Jerusalem and Haifa film festivals) starts as a typical family story. A few weeks after the director's grandmother dies the family starts looking into the things accumulated in her Tel Aviv flat. The apartment is full of objects gathered through a full life, and as it gradually empties and light starts penetrating the shady corners, details from a hidden past start to emerge. As many other immigrants coming from Europe Gerda and Kurt Tuchler had gathered not only things from a past time and an old country, but also photos and documents of a life that brought them from the Berlin between the two wars to Palestine which was to become the State of Israel. Soon we learn that the Tuchlers seemed to be the kind of immigrants who kept not only memories and nostalgia, but a strong attraction and relationship with the old country. An intriguing story completely unknown to the third generation starts to uncover from the drawers and boxes left in the flat � photos, letters, newspapers from Nazi Germany and one of the strangest coins that ever existed, with a Magen David on one side and a swastika on the other. The Tuchlers were friends with a family of high Nazi dignitaries named von Mildenstein, they traveled with them to Palestine after the Nazis came to power and before settling here definitively, and the trip was described in details by Leopold von Mildenstein in the German press of the time under the title 'A Nazi travels to Palestine'. Despite the fact that the story was researched and mentioned in the German and Israeli press after the war, the family knows close to nothing about it. The film describes the process of gradual discovery which is not void of surprises, as they soon learn that the Tuchlers and the Mildensteins continued their friendly relations after the war, despite the fact that von Mildenstein seemed to have been quite an important figure in the Nazi regime, and related to the fate of the Jews (he was the one who recruited Eichman and preceded him in the position of responsible of the Jewish affairs). How much the Tuchlers knew about the activities of their German friend during the war and what these really were remains in part a mystery. The film focuses on the process of gradual discovery which is for the author-director a trip in the past of his own family, a trip which will take him to Germany, to Berlin where he discovers remote relatives still living in the same area where his grandparents lived and to a series of meetings with the daughter of the Mildensteins. Dialogs between German and Jewish families who lived through the war and between their descendants are never easy, and they say a lot about how people who lived through the period relate to history, how they cope with the horrors of the war and of the Holocaust and how they passed these feelings to the coming generations. A strong similarity soon emerges, as in both families, the German one and the Jewish one, the same rule of silence seems to have been enforced, the past was kept secret and almost nothing told to the next generation. The children were raised not to ask questions, and their lives were completely disconnected from the history of their families. During Goldfinger's inquiry and film making both families are up for painful revelations and none of the second generation is really prepared to cope with role played by the high German functionary in the Nazi regime, or with the fate of the Jewish grand-grandmother left behind in Berlin and murdered in the Holocaust. It is the third generation (of the director) who is destined to ask the questions and get part of the answers. The mystery of the Tuchlers is not fully revealed and will probably never be completely. In one of the final scenes of the film the director and his mother are looking under a pouring rain for the grave of the grand-grandfather in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin. They cannot find it, the place where it should be is covered by vegetation. The physical link with the past has completely vanished. The spiritual link of the old generation who could not tear themselves from the cultural and mentality relation with the old Europe even after the horrors of the Holocaust is the troubling secret investigated and revealed in part by this documentary.",
         "The death of six million Jews in Nazi concentration camps during World War II is a well known fact. What is less known and generally not talked about is that there were Jews who, for whatever reason, collaborated with the Nazis. Though Jews were forbidden to join the Nazi Party, some were members of the ghetto police that helped round up Jews for deportation, some were known as Judenrats who, under Nazi orders, compiled a list of other Jews to be deported. Others edited pro-Nazi anti-Semitic magazines, turned in fugitive Jews hiding under false identities, or were informers and Kapos who served as Nazi enforcers in the concentration camps. The issue of possible Jewish collaboration comes up in Amon Goldfinger's award-winning documentary The Flat, a story of three generations of Jews seeking to come to terms with uncomfortable events in their family history. A short time after their 98-year-old grandmother dies in Tel Aviv, the son Amon, who is also the writer and director of the film, together with his mother Hannah begin the process of going through mountains of the grandmother's accumulated belongings including books, clothes, antiques, letters, and photos. It is readily apparent that the grandparents, Gerda and Kurt Tuchler, who came to Palestine from Germany at the beginning of the war, retained a strong identity with the old country. \"They never leave their homeland behind,\" Amon remarks, noticing that Gerda's books are all in German and that neither of his grandparents ever learned Hebrew. He also discovers a strange two-sided coin that has a Star of David on one side, and a Nazi swastika on the other side. In looking through piles of letters, Amon is baffled by finding a Nazi propaganda newspaper, Der Angriff, containing an article titled \"A Nazi in Palestine,\" showing pictures of his grandparents accompanied by SS member Baron von Mildenstein, and his wife during a trip to Palestine in 1934. After more searching, Amon finds that other letters and photos reveal that the Tuchlers maintained a friendship with the Mildensteins during and even after the war, even though Gerda's mother had been killed at Theresienstadt. Mother and son travel to Berlin to meet with their remaining relatives and try to make some sense of the relationship their grandparents had with the von Mildensteins. They also travel to Wuppertal, Germany to engage in conversation with the Mildenstein's daughter Edda. In the beginning, the discussion is friendly but becomes more and more uncomfortable as Edda repeatedly denies that her father was ever a Nazi official. Unwilling or unable to confront deeply unpleasant truths, Hannah insists that she knows nothing about her parent's friendship with the Mildensteins, had never asked about it, and that children in her day were brought up to not ask any questions. Though the truth is incomplete and still uncertain in its scope and detail, both Edda and Hannah remain in denial that anything out of the ordinary took place, unwilling to confront troubling aspects of the Jewish past. The Flat is short on dramatics but it serves as a potent reminder that, as author Andrew Sullivan has said, \"When there's a challenge to our established world-view, whether from the absurd, the unexpected, the unpalatable, the confusing or the unknown, we experience a psychological force pushing back, trying to re-assert the things we feel are safe, comfortable, and familiar,\" or as Matthew Henry put it, \"None are so blind as those who will not see.\"",
         "Imagine that your grandmother has just passed away and your family is cleaning out her apartment. Amidst all the stuff your grandmother has collected, you find a tantalizing and shocking newspaper article involving your grandparents that you never heard about before from any other family member including your mother. This is essentially the set-up for 'The Flat', a fascinating new documentary by Israeli filmmaker Arnon Goldfinger. Goldfinger's grandparents, Gerda and Kurt Tuchler, were German Jews who emigrated to Palestine (now Israel) in 1936 after the Nazis forced them out. The article was from a virulent Nazi newspaper, Der Angriff, from 1934, which chronicles a trip made by a high Nazi official, Leopold von Mildenstein, to Palestine. The article features photos of Mildenstein traveling to Palestine with Goldfinger's grandparents. The mystery is not only why this SS man would go to Palestine with two Jews but why Goldfinger's grandparents would accompany him. Furthermore, Goldfinger discovers that his grandparents visited Mildenstein in Germany AFTER World War II numerous times and kept up a friendship with him and his wife. The documentary brings out the fact that in 1934 the Nazi policy of 'The Final Solution' (i.e. the extermination of the Jewish people) had not been developed and there was some consideration of deporting German Jews to Palestine. Mildenstein apparently was on a scouting mission to see if deportation was a feasible solution to the \"Jewish Question\". Mildenstein actually headed the SS Office of Jewish Affairs prior to it being taken over by the infamous Adolph Eichmann. Clips from Eichmann's 1961 trial in Israel are shown along with transcripts from the trial indicating that Eichmann considered Mildenstein as an \"expert\" on Jewish affairs and that he was basically his mentor! Nonetheless, Mildenstein, apparently was not a racialist and privately had no problems socializing with Jewish people. The Tuchlers may not have been aware of Mildenstein's Nazi affiliations and were simply glad a non-Jewish German would strike up a friendship with them. After Mildenstein's replacement at the Office of Jewish Affairs in 1937, his movements in Germany up until the end of the war were largely unknown. Goldfinger flies to Germany and meets up with Mildenstein's daughter, Edda, who firmly believed that her father was no longer affiliated with the Nazis during the war. Goldfinger seeks out a retired journalist who wrote about Mildenstein during the 1960s when he had become an executive for Coca-Cola. Although the former SS officer was mentioned during the Eichmann trial, his reputation wasn't tarnished as it was believed (as the retired reporter pointed out), that his affiliation with the Nazis had ended in 1937, when he was replaced by Eichmann. During the war (as Mildenstein's daughter's husband indicates) Mildenstein was believed to be a mere 'journalist'. The plot thickens when Goldfinger finds Mildenstein's wartime file in records located in the former East Germany, which were not available to journalists back in the 60s. Goldfinger discovers that Mildenstein was actually promoted as an official in Goebbal's propaganda ministry and worked there for the rest of the war. Goldfinger confronts Mildenstein's daughter with the new information about her father and she appears reluctant to believe what Goldfinger is telling her. Even after she shows her a copy of her father's resume indicating his Nazi affiliations during the war, it is obvious that she's now quite uncomfortable dealing with these new revelations. As for Goldfinger's grandparents, he interviews an expert on German Jewish history who points out that the Tuchlers obviously were not aware of Mildenstein's Nazi wartime activities. They were also willing to forgive him for any past Nazi associations, due to their past friendship with him. Despite being Jewish, the Tuchlers never learned Hebrew while in Israel and continued to speak German. They continued to identify with German culture in spite of the Holocaust and that's why they visited Germany many times after the war. For the most part, 'The Flat' is riveting--only the ending proves to be slightly awkward. As Goldfinger and his mother walk through an old German Jewish cemetery in Germany, they search for the grave of his great-grandfather. Goldfinger unnecessarily berates his mother for not taking more of an interest in her parents when they were alive in order to find out more about their history. Apparently, his grandparents were as complicit as the mother in not revealing information about their time living in Germany and their association with Mildenstein. The mother concedes she should have taken more of an interest in the family history but when she was younger, we have to believe her that she simply had no interest at that time. 'The Flat' brings to the fore more revelations regarding issues of guilt and responsibility of ordinary Germans vis-à-vis the Holocaust. By the same token, it chronicles conflicting feelings on the part of those German Jews who survived. 'The Flat' plays out like a detective mystery, with its talented creator cast in the role of high stakes super sleuth!",
         "The Flat (2011) is an Israeli movie, written and directed by Arnon Goldfinger. It's an unusual film, because I believe that the filmmaker truly didn't know how the movie would end when he started filming. Arnon Goldfinger's grandmother died in Tel Aviv at age 98. He and his family had the task of cleaning out the apartment in which his grandparents had lived since the 1930's. The family members were shocked to learn of their grandparents' close friendship with a German family, the von Mildersteins. This friendship had begun before WW II, but had endured the war, and had been re-established after the war. Goldfinger pursues the question of how his Jewish grandparents could have stayed in such close touch with a Nazi couple. Why did they do this? The director tracks down the daughter of the von Mildersteins, who welcomes them to her home in Germany. The daughter was well aware of the friendship, and apparently the friendship didn't strike her as strange. The director then digs deeper into the facts related to von Milderstein. Was he \"just a journalist,\" as his daughter believes, or was he much more? (The facts about von Milderstein are now available in the archives from the former East Germany.) We can only speculate about the explanation for how the friendship could continue for so long. This is especially puzzling, because Goldfinger's maternal great-grandmother (his grandmother's mother) had been killed by the Nazis. Goldfinger interviews an expert in post-Holocaust Jewry. The expert offers what I thought was a good explanation for the psychology of Jews who retained their ties to Germany and to Germans after the war. That answer is probably the best that the director--or we as viewers--are going to get. It explains behavior that would otherwise be inexplicable. This is definitely a film you want to seek out if you are interested in post-Holocaust behavior. It's also informative to watch von Milderstein's daughter deal with the new information that Goldfinger has uncovered. We saw this movie in the Rochester Jewish Community Center as part of the outstanding Rochester Jewish Film Festival. However, it should work very well on DVD. After you see it, you'll keep thinking about it. I recommend it.",
         "\"The Flat\" is a great documentary that leaves a lot of questions unanswered, which is as it should be. There are really no good answers for what unfolds over the next 97 minutes. Through the course of the film director Arnon Goldfinger tries to find out his family's recent past, in both Germany and Palestine, something that had never been discussed until after his grandmother died. The documentary confronts the messy business of life, and how people deal with family scandal and buried secrets. A war generation, both German and Jewish, forgets their past on purpose, the next generation is not encouraged to question their elders about it, and the third generation wonders why the two that went before could so conveniently ignore their own, and their parents, history. Goldfinger does a good job of laying out how all the participants in this documentary handle, or don't handle, their part in the story. It's a quiet film that is shadowed by immense subjects. As the viewer, we are left to wonder just how much we understand of our own family and its history, and if we have denied parts of our own past just as conveniently as some of the participants in this documentary have. It's a human story, in the end. Humans do terrible things and justify them in ways those of us who come after might find callous and chilling. Goldfinger cannot interview any of the original participants in this story, since they are all dead; some of natural causes, some in the Holocaust. The final scenes are just as void of answers as the rest of the film. Goldfinger and his mother look for her grandfather's grave in Berlin, in an old Jewish cemetery, during a driving rainstorm. They look in vain for any sign of their family member in this overgrown graveyard, but can find none. Both say they were not prepared for not finding the grave, as if it now suddenly is of the utmost importance that they find some link with their past, after so many years of silence on the subject. That's a good sign, because it might mean they will continue to confront the hard answers and keep up the search for their history, but as the viewer you weep, just the same, for all the love and knowledge that has been lost to time and death. We don't ever get that back.",
         "I found this documentary, written, directed, and narrated by Arnon Goldfinger, to be quite fascinating as it unravels like a detective story. When Arnon's grandmother Gerda Tuchler passes away in Tel Aviv, at the age of 98, Arnon and other family members, including his mother Hannah, converge on Gerda's apartment to help sort out its' contents. However when Arnon comes across an article from the 1930's, in the German newspaper Der Angriff ( a notorious Nazi propaganda publication), it opens up a Pandora's Box of questions and eventual investigations. Gerda and her husband Kurt Tuchler were living in Germany at the time, but they are shown in this article visiting Palestine with a known SS officer Leopold von Mildenstein and his wife. Further investigation by Arnon revealed letters and photos of a friendship between the Tuchlers and von Mildensteins which continued, after the Tuchler's migration to Palestine, during WW2 itself, and amazingly even after the war. One of the fascinating aspects of the film is that every time Arnon tried to find an answer to the past, new and vital avenues of inquiry would arise. It would take way too much space to document all that Arnon uncovered in the movie. However, I will say there were many surprises along the way which kept me quite riveted. Was von Mildenstein actually working with the notorious Nazis Eichmann and Goebbels, or had he left Germany on a world tour as his daughter Edda believed? Even after the war, did von Mildenstein work as a Coca-Cola executive despite the fact that his name was prominently mentioned by Eichmann at his trial? Was Arnon's great grandmother Susanne Lehmann sent to a concentration camp and murdered by the Nazis? If so, why wasn't he or any member of his family told about it? Crucial questions like these are attempted to be answered by Arnon, and as mentioned it all adds up to a riveting story where one layer after another is peeled off. I thought Goldfinger did an exceptional job, in his low key manner, of putting the pieces of this puzzle together in this exceptional movie.",
         "'Compartmentalization' is a type of psychological defense mechanism where a person has very conflicting values and/or behaviors and keeps them separate in their mind in order to avoid discomfort. An example would be a man who beats his wife and kids and yet otherwise appears to be a pillar of the community. While the term is never used in \"The Flat\", compartmentalization is a HUGE theme throughout this very unusual film. Aron Goldfinger made this documentary (using simple equipment) about his grandparents. It seemed when his grandmother died in her late 90s, the family began taking all of the old woman's things out of the apartment she had shared with her husband for many years in Tel Aviv, Isreal. During this process, something very strange turned up--a collection of photos and correspondences between the grandparents (the Tuchlers) and the von Mildensteins back in Germany. What made this so strange? Well, the Tuchlers were Jews who left Germany to avoid the Holocaust and Mr. von Mildenstein was a high Nazi official! In fact, although his own family today didn't know it (they thought he was a reporter), von Mildenstein actually hired Adolf Eichmann (one of the major architects of the 'final solution') and later worked for Josef Goebbels' Propaganda Ministry--and yet, as I said above, the Tuchlers and von Mildensteins remained friends and even visited each other in the years AFTER WWII! Yet, Mrs. Tuchler's own mother was killed by the Nazis! Wild, weird and a bit sad---this is a very unusual film that will pique your curiosity. Overall, a very intriguing little film indeed!",
         "What I never understood was how the holocaust could have happened in a country that had excelled in philosophic thoughts, music and literature. I have seen many films related to the holocaust. I have even visited Auschwitz. I never thought I would see a film like this on the subject. The film was very sensitively produced and seemed very honest to the content. What is fascinating is that the characters were all real. Like a documentary. Yet the film had a story that flowed. I would certainly see it again to fill the gaps that I may have missed. What I would also like to find out is the reaction to this film in Israel and Germany.",
         "I had never heard of this film as we don't get many documentaries in our area and if it was shown at a Jewish film festival, it would have eluded me. Although this is a documentary focused on the holocaust, primarily whet I took away; is that there are people who want to be realists and deal with the truths of their own and the lives of others and there are those who live lives of denial. It is my opinion that the second type of people actually endanger not only themselves but those they may love very much. I knew people who themselves had been in camps or were the children of those who had been, but I had never stopped to consider the \"lapping\" over of lives of those who had been persecutors and persecuted. And of course there must be many such instances of this. Many people on the message boards have criticized Aron Goldfinger for confronting the daughter, Edda, of the Von Mildensteins. But why should he not have done so? She said her father was traveling in Japan during the war, but did his grandparents receive any letters from his travels then? I was sort of disgusted with both husband and wife in that situation. that the camps had been Russian and American propaganda, I am roughly the same age as Hannah and Edda and believe me I would have known if all the Jewish children in my school had disappeared. What do they think happened to those people. Where are all the other Arons that should have populated Germany? They never got born because there parents died in the camps. Through one of those odd twists of fate I became involved in a correspondence with a woman whose parents had been very prominent in Hitlar's Nazi Germany. When it was found that one of the couple were not completely Aryan they had to leave Germany and settled with their large family in the town I now live in. When I first heard from one of these children I did research in the newspaper archives here, and like Edda my correspondent was very desirous of explaining away her parents involvement in events that took place in Germany. We here in the United States are supposed to continue to feel guilty about the fact that this country once allowed slavery. No one alive today owned a slave here, and many are descended from people who did not even live in America during slave owning years. But there are many in Germany who lived though those years of 1930 and 1940 and who claim to have no knowledge of anything unpleasant that happened, except to themselves. As we learn Edda and her husband had spent many years living in England. My husband and I are both very pleased that we saw this wonderful documentary and we both liked Aron very much.",
         "This movie is about the emotional and historical journey taken by Arnon Goldfinger, a filmmaker, as he explores his grandmother's life based on artifacts he finds among her possessions after her death and interviews with people outside the family. Goldfinger's grandparents left Germany in 1936 for Palestine. As the daughter of someone who was similarly expelled from Germany by the Nazis, this movie resonated deeply. The silences, secrets and omissions in the family's communications about themselves and their history are very familiar. Goldfinger does an excellent job of revealing the sadness and confusion created when painful truths are revealed. The movie centers on Goldfinger's great-grandmother Susi, his grandmother Gerda, and his mother Hannah. Matralineality is recognized by the Jewish faith as the means by which Judiasm is conferred on offspring. In this sense, the women are the keepers of the faith. For Goldfinger's family, Gerda did not, or could not, sustain the powerful emotional family life that she knew in Germany. Her daughter Hannah was almost completely ignorant of her grandmother Susi's existence and had a relationship with Gerda that was not particularly close. When Hannah discovers Susi's letters among Gerda's effects, letters that proclaim love for Hannah and fervent hopes for Hannah's safe future, Hannah shrugs and claims she knew nothing about it. This is a profound emotional loss for Hannah, even though she fails to recognize it. Arnon's relationship with his mother Hannah is similarly not particularly close. In the end, this is the movie's most powerful message: how the Holocaust destroyed much more than the millions of lives terminated. Through the thread of the plot that traces the history of a highly ranked Nazi whom Goldfinger's grandparents befriended, it is also clear that the Germans were never held fully accountable for their crimes. Congratulations to Arnon Goldfinger for having the courage to explore the past, no matter where it led."

         "When Arnon Goldfinger's grandmother dies in Tel Aviv, his whole family come around for the necessary disposition of her property. While dealing with all the stuff, Arnon makes a shocking discovery: evidence that his German Jewish grandparents had a long-lasting friendship with the senior Nazi SS officer, Leopold von Mildenstein, before and after World War II. His repulsion and confusion at how his beloved grandparents could have done that sends Arnon on an international search for the truth. In doing so, Arnon learns about a complex relationship, in which family, sentiment, history and human nature combine to produce a kind of denial in reaction to the worst of reality.",
         "German-Jew Gerda Tuchler has just passed away at the age of ninety-eight. Although she lived in the same Tel Aviv flat for most of her life with her long deceased husband Kurt Tuchler following the extradition of Jews from Germany in the 1930s, she was more emotionally German than Israeli as witnessed by the fact that she never learned how to speak Hebrew. One of her grandsons, Arnon Goldfinger, for his own historical record, decides to film the process of cleaning out Gerda's apartment, that process led by Gerda's daughter/Arnon's mother, Hannah Goldfinger. They all go into the process believing that beyond the painted portraits of Gerda and Kurt, there is little anyone would want to keep or that they would be able to sell among Gerda's possessions. However, they stumble across records that Gerda and Kurt were close friends with Leopold von Mildenstein, a high ranking Nazi official and mentor to Adolf Eichmann in the 1930s, and his wife, Gerda von Mildenstein, that friendship which was established in Germany before their extradition, and continued even after the war. Arnon then decides to step in front of the camera as he begins to search for information on that friendship with Hannah, whose generation had a \"put the past behind\" mentality especially about the war and Jewish persecution by the Nazis. That search for information not only delves into the Tuchler side, but also the von Mildenstein side, discussion of Naziism with von Mildenstein's relations which may be a touchy subject. Their discoveries will include what happened to Hannah's maternal grandmother, Susanne Lehmann, which makes the Tuchler/von Mildenstein friendship all the more astounding.",

      "plotSummary": "The flat on the third floor of a Bauhaus building in Tel Aviv was where my grandparents lived since they immigrated to Palestine in the 1930s. Were it not for the view from the windows, one might have thought that the flat was in Berlin. When my grandmother passed away at the age of 98 we were called to the flat to clear out what was left. Objects, pictures, letters and documents awaited us, revealing traces of a troubled and unknown past.  The film begins with the emptying out of a flat and develops into a riveting adventure, involving unexpected national interests, a friendship that crosses enemy lines, and deeply repressed family emotions. And even reveals some secrets that should have probably remained untold...",
