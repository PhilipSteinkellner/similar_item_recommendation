         "It's a shame that most people here seem to have seen a cut version of this film, because the actual original is absolutely beautiful, and belies the criticism that Franco was a complete hack. It is a perfect example of what can be achieved in the horror genre with an almost zero budget in what was probably the director's busiest period. However most people seem to have seen the US release print, which also circulated on video in the UK in the 80's under the title of `The Invisible Dead'. This film was marketed as being a successor to Fulci's `Zombi', and basically was padded out with scenes from Jean Rollin's `Lake of Zombies' (shot almost 10 years after Franco's original film) and had all nudity removed. There is another version which circulated with hardcore black mass footage featuring Franco regular Alice Arno and a host of stunt doubles for Vernon, Nichols and von Blanc. The only video release of the original film at present is on Redemption, featuring a couple of nude mass scenes, some lesbian vampire sucking, a bizarre scene where Christina knocks over a giant phallus and an effectively hypnotic score from Bruno Nicolai. The UK version is missing the rather graphic rape scene present in the Benelux versions. Christina von Blanc never unfortunately appeared in any other Franco films \u0096 in fact only appeared in a couple of others including the giallo `L'Etrusco uccide ancora'. The delightful pairing of Britt Nichols and Anne Libert occurs again in his bizarre `Erotic Rites of Frankenstein' and `Les Demons', amongst other films of the period. If you are interested in Franco, this is one of his best of the period, very atmospheric and deserves to be seen in its original version.",
         "I'm not implying that watching this drunk would be a great idea, I meant it in a \"Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas\" kind of way, if that makes no sense. nevermind. Back to the subject. We already have Night of the Living Dead, Erotic Nights of the Living Dead, we even got a Hell of the Living Dead, so why the hell not A Virgin Among the Living Dead? They could probably use one. Although, that's not the original title, and has absolutely nothing to do with what goes on, I'm not entirely sure what to think of this one, yet, that's probably why I dig it so much. What almost seems more like some kind of shroom-dream... make that shroom-nightmare, A Virgin Among the Living Dead is director, Jess Franco's exploration into the grey area between life and death, or at least that's what they say. As of this moment, all traditional B-horror rules have now been thrown out the window. We begin with a young woman, Christina, traveling to an out of the way, castle, in Spain. There, stay the relatives of her estranged father, who has recently committed suicide, soon, there will be a reading of the will. Once Christina arrives in town, she's looked at like shes crazy after asking for directions, she's told no one lives there. The next day, with the guidance of a mute, Christina arrives at Monserat, to find that all her relatives are somewhere between eccentric, and insane. Monserat is filled with some kind of evil/confusion/ insanity, it's just very incoherent. Although her peculiar relatives seem kind of harmless, Christina suspects that something is a little off, when her step-mother warns her to leave, seconds before her death, not to mention bizarre occurrences such as, waking up one morning to find a big, black dildo on the floor, and a blind girl sitting in the corner, walking in on blood sucking sessions, finding dead bats on her bed, just, confusion, after confusion. and not even being allowed to have friends over, also seems a bit suspicious. Besides all the random confusion, it really seems like death is hovering over everything. With this film coming off as a dream, and being about death, then, isn't this just one big nightmare? Possibly, but I think it's deeper than that. It is said that Jess Franco made this film as a way to cope with the death of Soledad Miranda, hence, the emphasis on death. For a horror film to come off as a genuine nightmare will always be a job well done, regardless of the intended message. Whatever message Franco intended, was intended for Franco, we're just lucky that he shared it with us, because witnessing such surreal magnificence really is a rare experience. The vibe of this film is simply indescribable. For more dream on film, check out Messiah of Evil, and Death Bed, although, You really won't find anything quite like this one anywhere, not even from Franco. Above all else, A Virgin Among The Living Dead is bold, independent film-making in its purest form. 9/10",
         "This was only my fourth Jess Franco movie: not as satisfying overall as THE DIABOLICAL DR. Z (1965), not as thematically compelling as EUGENIE\u0085THE STORY OF HER JOURNEY INTO PERVERSION (1969) \u0096 but it has, perhaps, the most haunting quality of all. So far, only LUCKY THE INSCRUTABLE (1967) has proved disappointing \u0096 and, therefore, I look forward to acquiring some more of his remarkably prolific work. As always Franco did not have much of a budget to work with: consequently, the film is visibly cheap (though I must say it suits the mood perfectly!) and his direction suffers for it, given as he is to an over-use of zoom shots, but still manages enough inventive touches throughout to draw one into the proceedings. Bruno Nicolai's score, though not as catchy as his EUGENIE soundtrack, is certainly varied and weird enough to be quite effective. The film also makes good use of natural locations \u0096 the chateau, the forest, the pond \u0096 which give it a distinctly European look. The plot (what little there is of it) is quite bizarre and deliberately ambiguous but the surreal, dream-like quality it creates \u0096 effectively balanced by macabre touches of comedy \u0096 is wholly infectious, making the film an enjoyable one despite its shortcomings. The casting is an integral part of the film's success: Christina von Blanc is simply gorgeous, and a more than adequate heroine in the circumstances; Britt Nichols' contribution, then, can best be described by these three adjectives: beautiful, mischievous and memorable; Anne Libert is yet another highly attractive lady but her role, even if appropriately death-like, is a little too sketchy; Howard Vernon lends the film a certain style and a dash of sophisticated humor it would otherwise have lacked (this is perhaps the most impressive performance by him I have seen yet, despite brief stints in Melville's BOB LE FLAMBEUR [1955], Lang's THE THOUSAND EYES OF DR. MABUSE [1960] and Godard's ALPHAVILLE [1965]) \u0096 also, it is rather amusing to see gay Howard Vernon being surrounded by so many lovely women who, more often than not, have no clothes on!; Paul Muller is again underused - as he was in EUGENIE - as well as (necessarily) cramped here, though he manages to make his presence felt throughout the entire film; Jess Franco himself is funny and oddly endearing as the mute servant, a potentially irritating character. I would like to say something about Franco's use of nudity: while frequently gratuitous, it is also undeniably striking (at least judging by this film and EUGENIE) \u0096 and watching, say, Christina von Blanc asleep or taking a swim in the nude is not simply a case of voyeurism because the images in themselves are beguiling on an artistic level. That said, the S&M lesbian scene between Nichols and the blind girl is quite a head-scratcher! In my opinion, Nichols' seduction of von Blanc is the film's most potent sexual image. I have read a number of reviews on this film as well as some of the discussion in connection with it on other boards, where a lot has been made of the fact that the version featured on the Image DVD may not be the definitive Director's Cut after all! Francesco Cesari mentioned a misplaced scene (Christina's 'death'), but all I can say is that it did not jump out at me on a first viewing (of course, Franco's work is open to several interpretations) \u0096 though it is true that Anne Libert, the 'Queen of the Night', had no reason as such to get undressed! On the other hand, the ebony phallus did come (oops, no pun intended!) out of nowhere: the way it was introduced, strangely enough, reminded me of the first appearance of the monolith in Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968) - as well as bearing an obvious similarity to a particular ornament in his A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (1971)!! Also, the odd repetition of scenes with Muller 'calling' von Blanc felt like padding \u0096 at one point, this occurred three times in a row (!), i.e. until Muller himself explained that he was being forced to do so by Libert, who is really after the girl. But, as a general rule, I was satisfied by the film \u0096 without leaving me asking for more, as it were. Apparently, the longest existing version of the film runs 105 minutes (often mentioned by Robert Monell) but, at that length, the film's quirky charm is bound to flounder \u0096 especially in view of the distinctly graceless added zombie sequences. I am of the opinion that Christina (much like Lisa in Mario Bava's LISA AND THE DEVIL [1972]) is already dead at the beginning of the movie, only she doesn't know it \u0096 sort of a wayward ghost \u0096 and her family's ploy (the reading of the will) was only a means of reclaiming her. The cut back to the tavern near the end, I guess, means that Christina maybe dreamt the whole thing but, then, her 'return' to the chateau immediately afterwards, in a way, indicates that she has now accepted her death \u0096 as relived in her dream state \u0096 and is therefore perfectly willing to be led into the swamp by the Queen of the Night, followed by the rest of her family now that their 'job' is done. I'm sure that with repeated viewings, I'll be able to read more into it and, perhaps, even discover flaws I would not have immediately noticed! As for the DVD itself, Michael Elliott has said that the Image transfer is the best he has seen; well, to my eyes, it is certainly nothing earth-shaking. There is a frequent hiss on the soundtrack, but the audio is otherwise serviceable \u0096 and, thankfully, the original language is available. The deleted scenes are just terrible \u0096 I know I don't ever want to watch the dreaded Jean Rollin cut of the film, a travesty on the lines of THE HOUSE OF EXORCISM (1975) \u0096 though I still wish that all of the 'extra' footage could have been assembled for this edition. The theatrical trailer is interesting for a number of alternate shots and at least one curious outtake. Tim Lucas' liner notes are typically reverent but also reasonably knowledgeable of the film's chequered history \u0096 and I agree with Francesco Cesari that Lucas' personal interpretation of the events of the film are entirely valid. Finally, Robert Monell's description of A VIRGIN AMONG THE LIVING DEAD's partial remake \u0096 THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR (1973), admittedly a far more poetic title \u0096 is indeed enticing and, hopefully, this too can be released in future (depending on available elements) by Image themselves, Blue Underground or Synapse, all of whom have demonstrated a commitment to Franco's films by preparing a handful of titles in top-quality DVD editions.",
         "Take a dash of Franco and layer in a generous helping of Rollin and, viola!, you have A VIRGIN AMONG THE LIVING DEAD. This is a work of atmosphere and subtle eroticism. Although it is not a zombie film, death -- and those who wear its cloak -- is its central theme. Christina von Blanc, an achingly beautiful creature, plays Englishwoman \"Christine\" who journeys to the rambling estate of her late father (Franco regular Paul Muller) for the reading of his will. Her stay is a nightmarish one as she is harassed by several socially challenged relatives (Howard Vernon being one), a muttering Igor (Franco himself) and local miscreants. Not as technically accomplished as Franco work such as THE AWFUL DR. ORLOFF or even DR. ORLOFF'S MONSTER, this piece is, nevertheless, dream-like and filled with mood and unease. Bruno Nocolai's score is quietly evocative and Jose Climent's photography is low rent but brimming with inspiration. The rural locations are gorgeous, too. Typically, the dramatic revelations are hackneyed and not everything makes much sense, but that is Franco's way, and if you can't accept that, steer clear of his fascinating, uneven oeuvre. Ms. von Blanc makes every one of her screen moments sparkle and comes closest to possessing the magical aura of the late, great Soledad Miranda, Franco's most exquisite leading lady and muse.",
         "most have only seen the cut version with added zombie footage shot by director Jean Rollin, which makes the film an irritating, confusing mess. the uncut european version is a GREAT confusing mess! one of Franco's personal favorites, which he also ha a meaty acting role as Basillio, a deranged mute. great cinematography, great weird performances from all the actors, and a kick-ass score by Brun Nicholi. best watched very late at night, but be sure to track down an uncut print.",
         "And does that EVER apply here! I have a really soft spot for this crapper. Long, long ago, I saw it under the title \"A Virgin Among the Living Dead\". It made no sense! Then, years later, in my pursuit of obtaining bad films, I found an almost-uncut version. There are so many different edits of this film, it's hard to find the definitive cut. The one I currently have makes much more sense than the usual rental version. To clear things up, zombies were not part of the original film (titled \"Christine, Princess of Eroticism\"). The zombie footage was taken mostly - if not entirely - from \"Zombie Lake\" (1980), which means they were spliced in well after \"Virgin\" was released (1971). Anyway, \"Virgin\" is about a girl named Christine, who journeys to her uncle's chateau for the reading of his will. What she finds is both revolting (to the squeamish) and humorous. Jess Franco does his job of playing the disheveled freak rather well. He just looks like a sleazebag. He also does an adequate directing job. The movie is very stylish as is typical with Franco's work, but also rather visually stunning, with the shots of the lush forest surrounding the chateau. There is even some strong atmosphere, particularly when, in one scene, Christine's uncle is drawn back into the shadows after speaking to her. The film culminates in a sexual ritual that is severely--not to mention ridiculously, at least with the \"Zombie 4\" version--edited on any of the American prints. In fact, many of the scenes that help make the film more cohesive are also excised from American prints. The (as close as possible to) uncut version is really good if given a chance. Though not necessary, outside. . .influences can only help the viewer (and no doubt were used during the making of this trash classic). \"Virgin\" + melatonin + dank fun dreamy state. Unfortunately, as so many others have mentioned, you won't see Christine nude unless you can find a completely unedited tape. She sure is hot! Shame she was only in three films (at least according to the IMDb). So that's it. I like it, but most don't. It's worth seeing just because it's better than any given American slasher flick.",
         "Many of the comments here are written about the hacked up version of 'A Virgin Among The Living Dead' so ignore them. This is actually a very watchable movie, not the best Jess Franco I have seen, but still above average. More an erotic fantasy than a horror movie per se, it will appeal to fans of 60s/70s Euroschlock like 'Nude For Satan' and Franco's classic 'Vampyros Lesbos'. The stunningly beautiful Christina von Blanc plays the lovely innocent Christina Benson, who is summoned from boarding school in England to the reading of her father's will in a spooky castle. She never really knew her father, or had previously met her bizarre relatives who live in the castle, which according to the locals is deserted. It doesn't take much to work out her family's \"secret\", the title tells all. Christina however, is a bit slow to catch on. She spends most of her time wandering around in a daze, often naked (great news for us viewers!), and increasingly unable to tell dream from reality. There's not much action in this movie, and very little horror, but it has an almost Argento-like nightmarish feel to it, and like most of Franco's output, is very stylish despite the obviously low budget. The sight of the gorgeous Ms. Blanc is more than enough for me to recommend this movie. One look at her and any failings 'A Virgin Among The Living Dead' has will quickly be forgotten! An enjoyable fun movie.",
         "A Virgin Among the Living Dead was directed by the mega prolific Jess Franco at a period when he was delivering his most consistently interesting work. It's definitely one of his better films. It's another low budget sexploitation flick that was obviously cheaply made but there is no denying that this was one of the movies where Franco took a bit more care. The result is an effectively dream-like and quite stylish erotic horror. The story revolves around a girl who travels to a remote mansion for the reading of the will of her recently deceased father. While there she encounters her very strange relatives and pretty soon a series of bizarre events start to occur, including strange supernatural happenings. This is one of the movies that really shows that Franco definitely had something interesting to offer. His filmography was wildly erratic and uneven, which is really to be expected for a director responsible for two hundred films. However, on occasion his left-field, slightly surrealistic style produced movies that were amongst the best in the erotic genre. There is definitely an interesting ambiance to this one. The selection of weird characters and the strange events experienced by the heroine are all successfully dream-like. There is a fair bit of striking imagery such as the seated man who is pulled slowly backwards into a black void, a strange night-time walk through the woods, a vampiric lesbian coupling and the occult ceremony near the end. The latter is scored by cool music by Bruno Nicolai whose soundtrack is very good throughout the film and helps sustain the mood. Franco regular Howard Vernon plays a lecherous uncle but best of all is Christina von Blanc in the title role. She was very beautiful and this is one of her rare appearances.",
         "The student Christina Reiner (Cristine von Blanc) travels from her boarding school in London to the castle of her family in Montserrat for the reading of the will of her father that she has never known and recently committed suicide. On the arrival, she spends the night in an inn and people tell that nobody lives at the castle. On the next morning, the mute servant Basilio (Jesús Franco) brings Christina to the Montserrat castle, where she meets her weird Uncle Howard (Howard Vernon) that is playing waltz on the piano and her cousin Carmencé (Britt Nickols) that is painting her nails and they tell that her stepmother Herminia (Rose Kiekens) is on the deathbed. She visits Hermínia that tells her to leave the castle and dies. Christina also meets her Aunt Abigail (Rosa Palomar) and a Blind Girl and while waiting for the attorney, she entwines daydreams and nightmares with reality. When she has an encounter with the spirit of her deceased father Ernesto Pablo Reiner (Paul Muller), he tries to warn her to leave that place that is evil, but it is too late. \"La nuit des étoiles filantes\" is a stylish and senseless trash by Jésus Franco. The story has a promising beginning, but suddenly the plot seems to be incomplete and does not make sense at all. I believe that the problem is the different versions of Jésus Franco's feature. The DVD released in Brazil, for example, has audio only in English and Portuguese but the introduction is written in French; the lead character is Christina Reiner, and not Christina Benton; there is Death, and not The Queen of the Night; the raping scene is totally mutilated. Therefore, his movies are edited in the most different ways and this procedure certainly makes the story senseless. My vote is two. Title (Brazil): \"A Virgem e os Mortos\" (The Virgin and the Dead\")",
         "This was certainly one strange movie: Carmencé (Britt Nichols) is doing her toenails during a funeral service, and a head as a flower vase is in her room. Christina (Christina von Blanc) even drops in unexpectedly while Carmencé is licking blood from a blind girl (Linda Hastreiter). Everyone keeps telling Christina that no one lives in the castle she is visiting. One has to wonder as they do not eat with her. Maybe they are ghosts. They certainly don't object when she inherits everything from her father. She not only sees her dead father (Paul Muller) several times, but he talks to her. Is she dreaming? Is she dead and just doesn't know it? Death runs though this film. I have to say for a low budget film, it was beautifully done; the scenery and music were very good, and it was strangely interesting.",
         "Christina von Blanc is perfectly cast as naive, tender-hearted Christina, sheltered by the outside world during her growing years thanks to a father she has never knew. Sent to a boarding school, Christina has longed to meet her father, with only a few photos to give her any idea of what he looks like. Christina comes to a village located near where her family resides. She is to hear about what she will receive from her father's will, but is told that no one lives in the château located not far from where the village is. Despite this knowledge, which she felt was inaccurate, Christin ventures to the decadent estate, equipped with a lovely grounds and lily-pad pond. Paths which travel through lush green all around, Christina almost appears to be in a fairy tale land of which her previous sheltered existence has never allowed her to be a part of. But, there's a price for remaining in this new world she has inhabited. Her strange relatives and those who reside with them are hiding something and Christina will find that she will be in grave danger if she doesn't retreat. VIRGIN is yet another surreal, enigmatic Franco film where you might be asking yourself once it's over, \"What the heck did I just watch?!\" This Franco film is brimming with eye candy..from the beautiful naked women to the setting and many well-orchestrated images. The title obviously gives away who the characters Christina is amongst during the running time are. So that bit of mystery is revealed rather right off the bat, but this shouldn't keep you from giving it a shot. I'm sure, like many of Franco's films from this period, will leave many frustrated. Like, say, SUCCUBUS, the film seems ungrounded in reality. I guess one could see similarities to ALICE IN WONDERLAND, yet this turns into an erotically grim fairy tale. Among her weird family of misfits include an alluring sexual creature, Carmencé(the luscious Britt Nichols), morose Aunt Abigail(Rosa Polamar), the demented Uncle Howard(Howard Vernon in one of his most bizarre portrayals), and the family's mute loony manservant Basilio(Franco, who steals the film when Nichols isn't on screen). Paul Muller has a great role as Ernesto, Christina's father. Anne Libert is The Queen of the Night/Darkness, who reminds me a stunning grim reaper..her scene where she removes Ernesto from Christina in is desk chair as they slide away into the darkness is an amazing moment in the film. Franco's mute servant had me rolling in the floor with laughter, especially the scene with the decapitated chicken head or one scene where he and Abigail are trying to pry a precious diamond ring from a severed hand. The will-reading is a hoot as Basilio doses off while it's being announced..his snoring has Uncle Howard nearly cracking up. I also loved how Uncle Howard plays the piano. Vernon's opening scene, playing a waltz as one of the family is dying slowly from an illness is one of my favorites in the film..when Christina questions his reasoning for playing such lively music as another is dying, he quips that he could play a funeral tune.. So Howard just bangs away at the piano..it seems that's one of the few pleasures he still has concerning his \"condition.\" There some sexual tension between Christina and Carmencé...Franco doesn't quite delve into the promising possibilities there. The nudity is abundant..there are some magnificent shots of von Blanc in various positions, whether she nakedly lies in bed or under a long shirt..Franco has the keen ability to shoot her provocatively almost the entire film. von Blanc is quite a beauty. Very virginal and innocent..the perfect foil for Franco. She is not strong enough to escape what surrounds her and the bewitching atmosphere of the location has taken hold. Despite warnings from her father's spirit(..who was found hung by a rope), Christina has become too much a part of the estate and what it entails. Well, that's what I took from it..I couldn't be more wrong, that's the way interpretations are with a film so mind-boggling. Franco's camera, like it does with Soledad Miranda and Lina Romay, looms on Christina's body creating a desire to touch her naked flesh. Like Carmencé, Christina's so young and ravishing, but in this isolated and quiet world, few opportunities for her \"deflowering\" are available. She meets a possible love-interest after a skinny-dip in the lily pad pond, but the kid is scared off by Uncle Howard. There's a scene where Carmencé is writhing on the floor with only a half-buttoned shirt barely holding her nakedness within, possibly doting on the embrace of anyone, as Christina gazes. Another scene where Christina, crying in terror after finding dead bats on her bed, finds herself lunging into another room where Carmencé is drinking the blood from the flesh wound(..caused by a pair of scissors in Carmencé hand)of blind Linda Hastreiter, her only ally who, as her father does, tries to warn the poor girl of escaping before the curse would take over. Christina gazes for a long period as Carmencé feeds from Hastreiter, sliding her tongue delicately across the bloody wound(..I had to tell myself, \"Don't be aroused! Don't be aroused!\"). Perhaps there was an attraction that goes unresolved. There's a macabre sight-gag, a flower pot in Christina's room..it was in the shape of a rotted severed head! And, the skinny-dipping scene where two old perverts stand behind the bushes licking their chops while they stare at Christina's naked body swimming in the lily pad pond is priceless. Many of us male(..and possible female)viewers were doing the same. I know I was..",
         "I rented this piece of junk years ago, with the impression I was going to see sexy women and hungry zombies. At least that's what the video box suggested. Not only is it difficult to accept the skanky lead actress is a virgin, but there are no zombies. Nothing even remotely resembling zombies. Some loser North American video distributer got the rights to release a cheap Italian film, let's say it was originally titled Fully Clothed Girl Walking Around On Boring Island For Ninety Minutes, he blew twenty bucks on cheap zombie poster art, retitled it Virgin Among The Living Dead, and then he took my two dollars! There should be a law against deliberately deceptive advertising. I have nothing against idiots who make cheap lousy movies, only I like to know what I'm paying for. Anyone who watches this movie won't walk away a virgin, and the dirtbag video distributer won't respect you in the morning.",
         "I have the uncut version of this mess. I should have known better then to seek out this. Because I have a couple of Franco Movies, namely, Devil Hunter, Which is even worse. and Jack the Ripper. What a weird and confusing movie this is. And I don't mean that in a good way. The only reason for watching this crap is the nudity on offer by some top totty. I don't mind spoiling this for anyone by telling you that (from what I could understand) the girl is dead all along. There I have just saved you the price of a rental, and spared 90 min of your life. You have been warned AVOID 1/10 for the Nudity",
         "This movie begins with a young woman by the name of \"Christina Benton\" (Christina von Blanc) traveling from London to a castle somewhere in either Belgium or France in order to attend the reading of her late father's will. Along the way she is warned not to go but she continues on anyway. Once she arrives she is greeted by her distant relatives who have taken up residence there. Again she is discreetly warned by two of them to leave immediately but she disregards their advice too. On top of that, the longer she stays the more she discovers just how weird her relatives are. Yet she still continues to stay. Anyway, rather than disclose the rest of the story and possibly ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a Euro-horror film that was sadly typical of the early 70's. The fact that it was dubbed in English didn't concern me nearly as much as the overall plot which seemed chaotic and confused. Along with that, excluding the very end of the film, I thought most of the movie was quite dull. Be that as it may, I must admit that I thought Christina was absolutely gorgeous. Likewise, Britt Nichols (as \"Carmencé\") and Ann Libert (as \"The Queen of the Night\") also had their moments. But other than that I saw nothing worthwhile in this movie. Accordingly, I rate it as below average.",
         "I picked up this movie for $4.99 when it came out on vhs titled \"Zombie 4: A Virgin Among the Living Dead\". I'll admit, I saw Virgin and Living Dead in the same title and it intrigued me. After watching I felt like throwing it in the fire. What a piece of garbage. A nonsensical plot with, get this, NO NUDITY! I had never seen the original uncut version (I still haven't actually), but after reading reviews of this as a trashy nudity filled gore fest, I knew I had a different movie. The version I have doesn't have any black bars at all like a previous reviewer complained about, instead whenever the young girl has bad dreams, we see the same scene of zombies crawling out of a nearby lake and slowly creeping up on her. OH SO BORING! Also, there isn't any gore to keep you interested either. I really need to see the original uncut version, because I hated this film for years thinking Jess Franco sucked, and now I feel bad. Maybe it wasn't his fault after all. I've also been meaning to watch Zombie Lake, because I read that the US version of A Virgin Among The Living Dead had scenes from Zombie Lake spliced in to make it more \"interesting\" (fyi: it didn't work). That would account somewhat for the nonsensical story.",
         "I hate it when a film begins with the titles superimposed over a point-of-view shot of someone driving, as though this really was just someone's home movies taken on holiday. It's unimaginative and it reeks of cheapness, and that's exactly how this film begins. Strikingly beautiful, but dim, Christina von Blanc goes to her estranged family's castle for a reading of a will, where she is spied upon while skinny dipping, has an encounter with bloodsucking lesbians, and finds a dildo on her bedroom floor, while a severed hand turns up, one guy is hanged in a chair, and all sorts of other miscellaneous crap happens, as she is warned to leave the castle immediately. None of it makes much sense, especially in the heavily edited and rearranged, 79-minutes long US version, titled 'Zombie 4: A Virgin Among The Living Dead', which includes several segments directed by an uncredited Jean Rollin, filmed eight years after this film's initial release, and a completely different twist ending, in which the final scene reveals everything to have been a dream which Christina wakes up from, screaming. These later inserts do not include von Blanc, but an unnamed, unconvincing body double, who has noticeably longer, darker hair, and different teeth. She either holds her hands up to cover her face as much as possible, or her hair is covering her face as much as possible. This version also features very poorly done black boxes superimposed over any nudity, like one might have seen back in the 1980s on a local television network at 2 o'clock in the morning. And the film's American title gives away pretty much the entire film. The soft-core(?) 84-minutes long French version I've just watched (une vierge chez les mortes vivants) at least has all of Christina von Blanc's plentiful nudity to hold one's attention, and apparently a bit more chronological coherence to it. It also has beautiful scenery in Portugal, or wherever the hell this thing was filmed- but it's still weird as hell, and the camera constantly zooming in and out in almost every scene is really annoying, making it difficult to watch this, even just for gorgeous Christina's nudity. The website www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=3066 hyperbolically claims that \"some scenes were reshot by J. Rollin 10 years later\", and implies this film was shot in 1971 and sat unreleased until 1973. However, there are no other sources to suggest that this was actually filmed two years prior to its 1973 release, and copyright date listed is 1973, not 1971.",
         "Jess Franco brings to us another one of his Eurocine specials. This zombie/softcore entry introduces us to Christina a youmg girl who has been raised in boarding schools her entire life. Her mother died when she was very young and she hasn't seen her father since she was a child. When Christina (the titular Virgin in the title) is summoned to her ancestral home for the reading of her father's will she meets her twisted relatives who expose her to their strange lifestyles. This is basically a witches' brew of a film. Add an easily coruptable virgin,twisted family perverts, a french castle, a pinch of zombie pathos and a generous helping of skin and presto. This is one of Jess Franco's better looking films with good photography and decent camera work. The movie was recently released in a director's cut dvd version by Image and is well worth a look for fans and the occasional Jess Franco virgin. 7/10",
         "I bought this movie at a video store near me that is closing down for $5. I got it because a) it is out of print, b) the zombie photos on the back of the box looked halfway scary, and c) the cover art was fantastic! I got a real letdown. Actually, it wasn't much of a letdown; I expected the movie to stink, but I got more than I bargained for. There are spoilers ahead, so if you actually want to be surprised(frustrated is more like it) stop reading now. Okay, so the whole movie is this girl being chased by zombies- actually just regular-looking people, some with really bad teeth. And the zombies' scariest mode of attack was waving their hands in front of your face like a little kid impersonating Dracula or something. \"Does this bug you? I'm not touching you\" was all i could think. The movie faded from dream to reality, never knowing what was a dream and what wasn't. And finally, at the very end, the whole movie was a dream. I wish the movie had been a dream. Did the director/writers think this was going to make sense... or be scary? And what about the title? My version was called \"A Virgin Among the Living Dead.\" Well, the girl was never mentioned to be a virgin, and in fact virginity(is that a word?) had nothing to do with the movie. Another title for the film was \"Christine: Queen of the Erotic.\" Was there anything `erotic' about the movie at all? No nudity... no sex... no *mention* of sex. Just dreams about stupid looking zombies. And if some zombies started waving their hands in your face, couldn't you kick the crap out of them rather easily? One other title: \"Zombie 4.\" What is this movie a sequel to? Lucio Fulci's \"Zombie\" was filmed years later. Am I missing something? Please e-mail me if you know what this is a sequel to! One last thing: The photographs of zombies on the back of the box were apparently scenes from ANOTHER MOVIE because they didn't appear in this film at all!!! The zombies in this movie were just humans with no(or little) makeup AT ALL. Apparently, the movie stunk so bad they had to use scenes from another movie on the back of the box. Ditto with the truly awesome cover art; I think they paid more for the artwork than the movie(a lot of cheesy movies have great cover art). I think the scenes from the back might be from \"Zombie Lake,\" because the IMDB says in the `Trivia' area for this movie that it used scenes from `Zombie Lake,' although I didn't see any scenes which looked lifted from the other movie. Although I haven't seen the other movie, I assume this because reviews for ZL mentioned green face paint and these zombies had none. Then again, the zombies on the back of the box looked better than the reviewers are saying the zombies from `Zombie Lake' looked, so who knows. I think I've used up more than my share of space for this review, but the last thing I want to say was Manos was cool compared to this film. I give this movie * out of *****(with * being the least possible stars). Manos gets a *1/2. Final quote(from the movie!) if you decide to see it: \"Don't say I didn't warn you.\"",
         "This is one of those films that just leaves you scratching your head. A girl goes to this place in the Caribbean and has nightmares about zombies. That's it people! I'm in no way opposed to strange, dreamlike films, but this is just incoherent junk. Anyone expecting a George Romero or Lucio Fulci zombie film is bound to be disappointed as the zombies in this film really don't do anything. Their makeup is rather minimal too, maybe you can get away with that in black and white, but not in color. The only other film by Jess Franco I've seen is the so-so Jack The Ripper. I am willing to try a few more Franco films, since I recently purchased the soundtrack to Vampyros Lesbos, and really liked it. I think Orson Welles and Fritz Lang are supposed to have liked his work too.",
         "Jess Franco's A Virgin Among the Living Dead was a real disappointment to me. Based on the plot descriptions I had read on the internet and the recommendations of a few trusted movie friends, I was sure that it would become one of my favorite Franco films. The living dead family are the biggest bunch of \"do nothings\" I've seen. Other than play the piano, have sex, and stand around talking, they really don't do much of anything. At a minimum, I would have thought they would be creepy, but dressed in their mod 70s outfits, they look like swingers on the make. I've come to expect more of my living dead. Franco's camera work (or it could possibly be the editing) is especially erratic in A Virgin Among the Living Dead. The film presents random flashes of images that have nothing to do with what's taking place on screen. The movie features random shots of various trees, random bushes on the side of the road, a couple of unknown people, an unidentified lake, and an unidentified fisherman. In several scenes, it's obvious that Franco had some extra footage he took from a car window or while walking in a forest that he included in the movie. While some of the other shots are quite nice to look at, they don't overcome the chaotic imagery. Acting is the strong point in the movie. Even though he has one of the goofiest characters I've seen him play, Howard Vernon gives a very nice performance. Paul Muller, in a small role, is as solid as ever. But the surprise for me came from Christina von Blanc. For a relative unknown, she does a nice job in the title role of the \"virgin\".",
         "This one is about a girl who travels to a small european island to get a grip on her dead uncle's inheritance. She gets to meet her vampiresque family and some romero-esque zombies in what appears to be some obscure dreams (but it's still unclear) and she even meets her hung father who shows her some dark secrets we never get to know. The whole thing is very stylish, tho. Old Jess looks like he liked the script a lot, cause it's very well shot and there are a lot of beautiful images in it. And the actress is pretty cute... Everytime she undresses the camera turns away, leaving the viewer frustrated (cuz this Christina is sure someone). There is a X-Rated version somewhere, out there, but Franco's hiding it real well.",
         "Surreal, dreamlike, lyrical, macabre \u0096 words you may have seen used to describe this slice of Gothic Euro-horror from prolific Spanish director Jess Franco. Having just watched the 'uncut and uncensored' DVD of Virgin Among The Living Dead, I would personally use words such as boring, stupefying, incomprehensible and pretentious to convey my feelings about this dreadful film. Jess Franco's employs his usual 'stylish' flourishes (ie. awful zooms, extreme close-ups, bad editing) and throws in a fair amount of nudity, to tell the tale of Christina (played by the gorgeous Christina Von Blanc) who travels to her ancestral home to attend the reading of a will. There she meets the other members of her family for the first time \u0096 a group of weirdos and lunatics who spend the rest of the film stripping off, drinking blood and generally acting freaky. Christina witnesses many bizarre events during her stay and is eventually found delirious, wandering in the woods, and is taken to the hotel where she stayed the night before. Here, she is seen reaching out to a woman, who leads her into a lake where she disappears under the surface. Is this a dream? Reality? Is she actually dead? Do we really care? By the end of the film, I was struggling to keep myself awake. As I was reaching for the 'stop' button, lo and behold, a whole slew of 'bonus scenes' popped up on my screen, featuring some of the worst zombies in cinematic history (apparently the work of French horror auteur Jean Rollin \u0096 nice job, Jean!). Now I don't want to sound like a philistine \u0096 after all, there are plenty of people out there who laud this as a classic \u0096 but 'Virgin Among The Living Dead' really stands out as a low point in my horror-viewing history. Bar the naked chicks and one groovy scene featuring a man floating backwards with a rope around his neck, I really found this 'classic' to be a chore to watch. You have been warned.",
         "Jesus Franco is one remarkable director. He made tons of films by using tons of different names. Some of them are absolutely brilliant and few of the greatest Italian cult titles out there. Some of them are rather disappointing and only enjoyable if you're a die hard cult fan. Virgin among the living dead (I use the title I think it's best known as) belongs to category number 2, I'm afraid. It doesn't make the least bit impression and unfortunately, it ain't bad enough to be \"good\". The whole story is about a young and attractive girl. She runs around more naked than girls in a porno movie, so if you like that, you made a wise choice seeing this film. I didn't mind myself of course, but after a while it really starts to become boring. It's not of any importance to the story and it certainly ain't artistic if that's what they thought. OK, so the girl is invited to a castle after her father died. In this castle, some family members of the girl live together. These people are the living dead...zombies, but they look like normal people. Christina sees her dead father appear ( with the rope around his neck all the time, that's rather funny ) and he warns her about them and he tells Christina to get out of there. what else is there to say about Virgin among the Living Dead ? Nothing actually, these kind of films still beat the mainstream and average nowadays horror films but overall they don't mean much. Well, at least not this one. I can give a lot of other titles Jess Franco made who DID were fascinating and masterpieces. The awful Dr. Orlof just to name one. I don't really blame Jess Franco for this. Like I already said, he made enough movies to check out (about 200, almost all of them made with a different name) My advise : if you're not a true Italian cult fan, skip this one and start your search for Dr. Orloff. Next !",
         "Originally planning to watch a one movie of writer/director/actor Jess Franco's titles,I was happily caught by surprise,when a very kind fellow IMDber sent me not one,but two Franco movies!,which led to me stepping outside,so that I could mingle with the living dead. The plot: Leaving London behind so that she can attend the reading of her dad's will on a remote island, (as you do!) Christina Benton finds herself feeling incredibly uncomfortable around her surviving family members.Spending time with her family before the reading of the will,Benton starts to see her family involved in rather strange events,which leads to Benton having serious doubts over what is a dream,and what is reality. After the reading of the will,Benton finds her Family completely dismissing questions about how Benton's dad death.Suspecteting that her dad's death may have been far from natural,Benton begins to investigate the reason behind her family's strange behaviour. View on the film: Filmed as co-writer/ (along with Paul D'Ales) director (along with Jean Rollin and Pierre Querut) and co-star Jess Franco was grieving over the death of actress Soledad Miranda, (who was chosen as the original lead star of the title)Franco shows an unexpected level of (some) restrain.Franco and cinematographer José Climent give the film an intense dream-like appearance,as Benton's search for the cause of her dad's death,leading to Benton walking the line between earth and the afterlife. Joined by a wonderful score from Bruno Nicolai,the writer's cover the vivid horror moments with a strong air of mystery,thanks to the screenplay taking a vague approach to the background of the Benton's life,which slowly opens itself as Christina enters the unknown. Taking the role originally written for Soledad Miranda,the gorgeous Christina von Blanc gives an alluring performance as Christina Benton, with Blanc striking a really graceful note as she searches for the details of her dad's death.whilst in his performance, Jess Franco hits the movie with a superb bonkers note as his laugh goes across the screen,as Benton discovers that she is among the living dead."
