It had more daring jokes, it had a good audience, and better than that, I saw one of these shows while he was on tour. Seeing him live was just fantastic, and one of the best jokes was a guy shouting out \"Duckman\", and Carr asks why he is called that, the guys says \"long story\", and it turns out his name is Lee Drake! Anyway, this DVD of one of his shows performed during the tour is just brilliant. Also, if you have the DVD of it you get the special features of him being top of the \"star in a reasonably priced car\" track list; on Top Gear, and his own Comedy Idol (like X Factor, but for comedians). Jimmy Carr was number 12 on 100 Greatest Stand-Ups. Very good!"],
