      "reviews": ["As poor as my French is, I understood only about one-third of the dialog, and I still found this film enthralling. A heroic journey is undertaken by a group of young Masai warriors in an attempt to save their village from drought and death. They encounter dangers from nature and man along the way. One of the most intriguing aspects to me is that there are surprising characteristics that emerge among the warriors, and the heroes are not who you might expect. The film also has a highly authentic look to it. I have lived in Africa for several years and always cringe at the way village life is prettied- up in so many films; there is little of that here (but neither is it gratuitously gory). I will definitely watch it again (hopefully with subtitles next time)."],
