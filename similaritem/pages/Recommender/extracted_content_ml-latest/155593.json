         "From a production and video standpoint, it is quite raw. Many small but noticeable mistakes or maybe just a poor job of editing and putting all the footage together. The movie itself was very good. Based in small mid-west towns, it's natural for many of the characters to have religious beliefs, which they mention during the movie, but it is in no way a religious movie. There are quite a few true and important messages that you will be able to draw from the movie. Overall, it's a really simple movie in every way: the production, the setting, the characters, and in some cases, the message behind it. It's worth watching.",
         "This movie has some not too subtle Christian motives behind it, but does not directly involve scripture as it's motivations. It's a heartwarming little love story, with a few twists and plots (to include a few unsavory characters). No foul language, no inappropriate \"love scenes\", and at least a few reminders of what's truly important in life. It's a \"B\" movie, and it has quite a bit of flaws. that said, I'd watch it again, and share it with friends... That's why I'm recommending it to you! In short, if you like family friendly movies where God is at least a part of the people's thoughts, you'll probably like this movie. ENJOY!"
