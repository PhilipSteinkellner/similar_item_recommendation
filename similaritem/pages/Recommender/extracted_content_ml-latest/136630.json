         "This animated short, included on the tenth anniversary \"Clerks X\" DVD set, is a deleted scene (so to speak) that was excluded from the original shooting script of the film; in other words, it was written but never actually filmed. Using the \"Clerks\" TV show animators, Kevin Smith got the original crew back to voice their characters and re-film the deleted scene -- as a cartoon. There's a nice tie-in to \"Chasing Amy\" here. If you've seen that movie, Alyssa (Joey Lauren Adams) references her best friend who dies; in this scene, we view the funeral. There's some funny stuff with Randal that happens and the animation just works well as a tie-in to both series. This has gotten some bad reviews here on IMDb but I liked it for what it was. It's pretty funny and fits into the chronological timeline of \"Clerks.\" It's an entertaining short scene and if you ever get the DVD, make sure to watch it after the film as I'm sure you'll enjoy it for what it is.",
         "\"Clerks: The Lost Scene\" is an 8-minute animated short film and one of many sequels to Kevin Smith's original \"Clerks\" movie. There is a series and there is a second full feature film with a 3rd being out soon as well. Anyway, this short film here is a pretty bizarre piece. Certainly not for the easily-offended. It takes place at a funeral and we find out how one protagonist had intercourse with the deceased (when she was still alive) and how her parents came in that very moment. And what is happening here at the funeral is probably not gonna let them appreciate their daughter's ex-boyfriend anymore. The protagonist's pal was pretty annoying in my opinion, but other than that, it's a solid, slightly gross watch. Recommended.",
         "I loved this lost scene. It was a beautiful nod to the short-lived Cartoon, Which some network NEEDS to pick up on. ABC are fools for letting it go. The great tragedy with the animated series is that if you haven't seen the movie, you aren't as likely to find it as hilarious as K.S's hardcore fans do. Had he released the series now, or after Passion of the Clerks comes out, it would have done SOO much better as his movies are beginning to come out of the minority audience area. But back to the scene, the homage to Chasing Amy was fantastic, even bringing back Joey Lauren Adams for the voice. It also deserves another kudos for tying in events from Mallrats. The death cards were classic \"Got it, got it, need it, got it\"",
         "Okay That Was Just My Favourite Quote Censored For Internet. This Is Extremely Funny Movie. The Plot Is Dante and Randall attend Julie Dwyer's wake in this animated representation of a scene never before shot for the movie Clerks. (1994). A Reference In Mallrats & Chasing Amy As Well. I Was A Little Disappointed Jay & Silent Bob Wasn't In This. I Was Surprised The Father Was Played By Zak Knutson (You Never Heard Of Him...I Did He Was The Sexy Stud In The 2nd Clerks(I Am 100% Straight I Am Not Attracted To Him I Am Only Saying Thats The Only Name He Went Under)). All In All A Funny Movie Worth Seeing From Any Smith Fan.",
         "When i watched this last night, it blew my mind away, i couldn;t believe it, it was so funny and sick at the same time, the Jesus trading cards bit was sweet, Question 1: Was he in her pants looking for the keys or was he out side the pants. Question 2: WHY CAN'T THEY BRING BACK CLERKS the cartoon, i loved that show, and i'm glad i have it on DVD. this little short was better then anything i could think of, and i can think of some pretty sick stuff for them to do while they were there, but this was near what i thought happened.
