         "OK, so it's a cheesy remake of a camp classic.... But it is all good, harmless fun.... Darryl Hannah stars as the titular character - a wealthy heiress who grows to 50 foot tall after she gets angry. After a freak encounter with aliens, she grows to an enormous size after an argument with her husband (Daniel Baldwin) and her father. It's a perfect remake of the 50's classic, updated to match the current 90's time frame - with big business and big bucks hanging in the balance. Some argue that another actress could have been cast as the lead, but Darryl was at the height of her popularity during the early 90s and is perfect in this role. Others argue that this b-rated made-for-cable release was a case of her slumming in her career. Either way, this stands as a cheesy remake of the camp b-movie classic... A definite afternoon cheezer pleaser...",
         "ATTACK OF THE 50 FT. WOMAN (1993-MADE FOR CABLE TV) ** 1/2 Daryl Hannah, Daniel Baldwin, Cristi Conaway, William Windom, Frances Fisher, Paul Benedict. Special effects laden remake of the campy sci-fi classic about a troubled woman whose close encounter with a UFO transforms her into a giantess. Easily head and shoulders above its laughable predecessor, Hannah makes the most of her towering performance in a film that tries to mix feminism with kitsch. She gives Allison Hayes a run for her money in her behemoth bikini. Directed by comedian/\"Spinal Tap\" star Christopher Guest (too bad he didn't think of this as a vehicle for his wife Jamie Lee Curtis. Yowsa!!)",
         "Of course it is! This is the type of B-movie that you'll enjoy. I didn't expect to see HANNAH in this role. But it was fun in a corny kind of way. Although it is still the classic story just like the original, it is \"made for tv.\" But thats okay because Hannah leads that \"glamor blonde bombshell life\" that her beauty stops the film from falling apart. (5)",
         "Very funny B flick. Tried a bit to hard to stay a B movie but a wonderful lark of hit you over the head metaphor of a woman \"growing into her power\". Ms Hanna was the right choice for this transformative awakening. I'd live in Nancy Archer's pocket any day!",
         "A smartly feminist reading of the 1958 camp classic is the basis of this made-for-TV remake which needlessly opens up the proceedings by adding some 25 minutes of \u201ccharacter development\u201d \u2013 which, basically, means new personalities who further traumatize or assist the distressed titular female. Daryl Hannah has trouble coping with the ugly duckling part of the story but grows nicely into her role once the gigantic transformation comes along and in which she is curiously but attractively decked out in cavewoman garb! Excepting the rather obnoxious Daniel Baldwin (as Hannah\u2019s philandering husband), the rest of the cast is capable enough: Frances Fisher is Hannah\u2019s helpful shrink, William Windom is her greedy tycoon father and, best of all, Cristi Conaway is Baldwin\u2019s sexy mistress who practically changes to a more outrageous wig with every new scene she\u2019s in; I knew nothing of her going in but, being sufficiently impressed I looked up her resume' on IMB and, what do you know, she was once married to an actor of presumably Maltese origins named Salvator Xuereb!! This is all well and good, perhaps, but I still wouldn\u2019t say that this is an improvement on the unjustly maligned original; for one thing, there are no giant aliens to be seen here and, worse still, the goofy fat deputy is (predictably, under the circumstances) replaced by a squeaky, tomboyish girl. The sheriff and his deputy are here depicted as being avid drive-in cinema-goers and, at one point, Hannah rips off the roof of a cinema which is screening the 1958 original! The new coda is also quite amusing: having been received inside the spaceship which caused her enormous growth, Hannah is joined by two other gigantic beauties who, sure enough, look upon their tiny hubbies as they go confessing to their various infidelities in interstellar group therapy!",
         "I get really amused by the reviews from people who think this is a serious film - please grow up, people! A real tongue in cheek remake of a 50's B Movie, the sort of thing Rodrigues and Tarantino did later with Planet Terror, but this was WAY before that. Wonderful one liners and parodies of the fifties, loved the catering wagon with \"Arkoff & Corman\" on the side, a great tribute to the masters of the 50's B Movie genre. Loved it, Daryl Hannah is wonderful but so are the whole cast,the sleazy husband, uncaring father and the beautician mistress with the interchangeable hair ( a different wig in every scene) are classic characters you'll recognise immediately. looks like they really had fun making this. Well worth your time, don't forget the popcorn!",
         "When Kill Bill was released, the cult icon and movie goddess label was not only attached to the gorgeous Uma Thurman but also her equally beautiful co-star Daryl Hannah. Having been off the Hollywood radar for some years, Hannah suddenly had everyone remembering just why she made such a big splash with Tom Hanks way back in 1984. In between Daryl had made some interesting movies, some more memorable than others. But for every high profile movie like Wall Street there was a Crazy People, for every Roxanne, there was a Grump Old Man. But Daryl kept on and in the wilderness years she made a movie that shouts out to the viewer by the title alone. Attack of the 50ft Woman tells the story of Nancy Archer, a woman who is constantly chasing after her philandering husband. One night, after finding him once more at a motel, she drives off into the night on a deserted road. But then a UFO appears and hits her with a light. When she tells people of her experience, no-one believes her, least of all her cheating husband, who hopes she might now be declared legally insane, or her father, who only loves her because of her stake in the family business. But soon something strange happens to Nancy, as she gets more angry she starts to grow. Soon she is fifty foot tall, and while she is physically huge, her patience is thin, especially with her cheating husband, and her money grabbing father� Attack of the 50ft Woman is a comedy that is straight from the handbook of 1950s sci-fi movies, with back projection and dialogue that feels totally from that spaced out genre. The performance by Daryl as the ever growing Nancy is well played, her attractiveness is not just in looks, you really do fall for her charms, even if her dumb husband can't. That \"dumb husband\" played by Daniel Baldwin, does well in what is a one dimensional role, the guy is a creep and he's never going to learn his lesson. Meanwhile even Frances Fisher appears as the local shrink, while William Windom is all high and mighty as Nancy's father whose only interest in life is the interest he's making at the bank. This movie is probably forever left in the archives of forgotten video, or, like General Zod and his companions in Superman, left to be locked away forever and drift endlessly in space. Only the galaxy I found a copy in was a place called e Bay. And when I played it I found a movie that is worthy due to the lovely Daryl, and the concept of a woman rising above her bullying men and teaching them manners the hard way. Attack of the 50ft Woman deserves to be seen, rent it, buy it, or just record of the TV. But do watch it, because you don't want to make Hannah mad�",
         "If there was a Top-ten of movies that are hidden gems, this movie ought to be on this. Really, what do you expect from a movie about a giant woman. Fun surely and a good laugh because you will think that there are really people who have time and money to waste! Nevertheless, I find this movie as an actual brilliant call for feminism. It's subtle but the message is clearly heard and that's good when movies help to make a better world. Take the giant woman: why is she so tall? For the idiots, it's because aliens have abducted her. For others, her height is the necessary sign to end male superiority and advance women rights. Why do you have the usual babe? For the sex addicts, it's because sex sells and it's true that the babe is sexy. But she studies and wants to build her own life and shows the world that you can trust a woman! And we can add the police woman who is also asserting herself against man values! With this light movie, it's an interesting way to catch the attention of anyone and it would be a wrong choice to make exclusive social arguments only to intellectual (and often dull) movies. In addition, the movie is a great artistic work: with his bad frame, not bright colors, you really think you watch a movie that has been shot in the fifties. This feeling is actually well played because you can find as many modern objects (the copters) than 50's ones (the police car). The beginning of the movie with his two introductions recalls me the exact mood of those old science fiction movies I watched in my childhoods (\"Ants\", \"The Fly\"). As it is science fiction, it must also pass the test of the special effects and I think they are brilliant. The minimized stages are well crafted and don't look like puppets houses. Last words about the cast to conclude this review: The women are great and Daryl Hannah has always this kind softness about her. The Baldwinn brother is perfect because he looks and acts very like his brothers, that is to say big heads you want to slap!",
         "I haven't seen the original; I can imagine that it isn't as feminist as, or at least less overtly so than, this. Guest gets the tone, and this largely delivers what it promises. I know he can direct something hilarious, since I've seen Best in Show; this doesn't have the benefits of a cast full of proved comedic talent, and the writing is inferior, though not without chuckle-inducing moments. There are a couple of lines that are downright quotable. You probably know the plot already; Daniel Baldwin, a bastard merely by virtue of the fact that he's cheating on Darryl Hannah(even if the squeeze he found is also a sight for sore eyes), and several others (all male) talk down to her, and once she begins to grow in size, she attempts to exact vengeance upon them. The FX are cheesy, dated and obvious, and I would wager this was an intentional decision. This is both a spoof and an homage. There is brief suspense. The characters and acting aren't half bad. There is some sexuality(and eye-candy) and brief nudity in this. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to fans of the concept. 5/10",
         "I imported this one through a greedy shark that took quite a chunk out of me, but Darryl Hannah's beauty was worth the bite. I've wanted to see this ever since 1993, but the movie just never came my way. Harry sure was a loathsome idiot for neglecting his pretty wife that way. Hell, the guy had everything going for him, but still he wasn't satisfied. Oh, and she is just so huggable! That tall, elegant, warm-hearted slice of loveliness that he had to discard for brash Honey. She grows up spectacularly, and the stable and swimming pool scenes are especially good, although the downtown scenes with the 'houses' are kinda lame, but what I would like to know is where she got that dress? A circus tent? I really got worried that she was going to go the way ol' KING KONG did three times before her, but the ending took a different turn that falls far from satisfactory, a more here on Earth resolution was necessary, with everybody getting their just desserts in more conventional fashion, but okay, this is an unconventional movie. It's just, well, a movie should show its main protagonist to be so much better than the competition, and if the point was, during the Fifties, the man is so domineering, or aggressive, because of his size, let's reverse this, there really is no need for this with Nineties hindsight, yet Nancy becomes violent at the slightest provocation after her growth spurt. She used to keep herself in check; what happened to this discipline too readily thrown out? The moral of the story should have been that after the shift in power, she should have remained the better person, instead of simply playing to another stereotype. Brain power, there lies the answer. She is clearly smart, and this should have been her real Attack, her size just an ally lending her confidence. Her exposition of her father and husband's multiple wrongdoings should have brought much more discredit to the characters than were the case, and this would have been the climax of the movie, rather than these giantesses wielding threats flying around in a UFO. She also should have been returned to normal, and found a decent partner, somebody who truly loved her. The best thing about this movie? Darryl Hannah all the way! There was a surprising nude scene, however brief, involving Christi (Honey), but nothing detracts from the lead actress, the SPLASH mermaid superstar! Except maybe a weak, very much flawed script..."
