'Carmina y Amén' during its 98-minute plays make us think and make us laugh in equal parts, thus sound loud at some scenes (such as sharing Carmina and Yolanda Ramos) or Carmina lullaby sings her granddaughter. As for the actors, choosing which side is right and the actors what to say. Carmina Barrios again demonstrates that supports the fore as one that is able to capture the attention and eat the screen simply open their eyes. María León in 'Carmina o Revienta' did not quite fit me but this has enchanted me. It has not surprised me because he has already shown what it can do to spare but here is able to make us mourn and laugh with the greatest of ease and naturalness. A great success is to rescue women \"friend of the queen\" and conversation that is formed in the wake undoubtedly one of the funniest scenes. And is that \"Carmina\" is already a myth. And its director, Paco León, and definitely has its place in cinematic history of our country. And, if by \"Carmina o Revienta\" and revolutionized the way films, with \"Carmina y Amen\" has already made clear that his talent is no accident, but a diamond. It's a film that touches the heart and causes smiles and tears, without neglecting the subtle displays of today (Bárcenas, Royal Family, evictions, immigration ...) and giving us that very great character played by Yolanda Ramos."],
