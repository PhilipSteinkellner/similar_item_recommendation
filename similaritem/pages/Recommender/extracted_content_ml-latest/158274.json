         "This might or not be a Mexican \"Taming of the shrew\", but certainly it's a classic from the Mexican golden era. Some might remember it as a Felix/Armendariz movie, but I can assure you it is a Fernandez/Figueroa movie for two reasons; \"Enamorada\" and \"The Torch\". By this time, Fernandez, Figueroa and Armendariz were already well known in Hollywood, not only because of their recent success of \"Maria Candelaria\" (with the former Hollywood star Dolores Del Rio) obvious reasons to bring a lot of attention. Maybe that's why it wasn't equally distributed and popularized in USA, perhaps someone fall in love with it, to the point of buying it and redo it in an English version. An English version that excluded Maria Felix, but included a former Mrs. Chaplin (who also produced) and Pedo Armendariz with some of the original crew, and Cholula and the volcanoes of Puebla in the background. But no matter what version you see first, this one is by far better, but not much more realistic, considering what was the reality of the Revolution years.",
         "Pedro Armendáriz is the most handsome man I ever know, he illuminated the screen, when he appear all the harts stop's and you don't think in anything just in him. In this film, he is a General or the Mexican Revolution who has an important mission, but he fall in love with Beatriz (María Félix) who is the rich woman in the town (Puebla). That confrontation with his love and the mission is so wonderful. Thats why I say that all have hart, everybody thought that the revolutionaries doesn't think in that, but love is love and the hart has reasons that the reason doesn't understand. This is my favorite film, great actors, excellent Director (Emilio Fernández), lovely photography (Gabriel Figueroa), spectacular natural stages. In this film doesn't have a lot of dialog, all is with the eyes and the feeling's of the actors. I also recommended \"La Malquerida\", \"Las Abandonadas\", \"La Bandida\", \"Bugambilia\". Thank's for all this art. Jacqueline Arch",
         "When two very independent persons from opposite backgrounds fall in love, what can you expect?? Nothing but trouble. This love story takes place during the Mexican Revolution times(Early 1900's), but could very well take place in any other place or time in the world. The beauty of this picture is mainly due to the the great work of art performed by its photographer, Gabriel Figueroa that captures incredible moments, when by only looking at the main actress' eyes everything is said and understood. The Director, who else but Emilio, El Indio, Fernandez is said to have made this picture, as a reflection of his own life. A Revolutionary General that falls in love with the town's most beautiful and richest lady, someone perhaps too high above his social level. It is an entertaining movie where you can feel the rejection of the upper classes to the dominant peasants invading forces. The main actor was one of Mexico's greatest from its \"Golden period\": Pedro Armendariz, and the leading lady, Mexican Goddess, Maria Felix. As an added piece of information, due to the \"Indio Fernandez\" great international fame, a second version of this movie was filmed in English and directed by him in Hollywood in 1949 under the title: The Torch. Pedro Armendariz, who was born and raised in the USA repeated his role as in the original movie, along with Paulette Goddard(Charlie Chaplin's former wife). This second version was not quite as good as the original one.",
         "Armendáriz was terrific in this. I won't repeat the praises from prior reviews, I concur. My only problem with this film is that it wasn't true to the revolution. In that sense, it was indeed a Fernandez film as neither was he true to the revolution. He gave a Cristero slant to the issues of Church/State and redistribution of wealth. Just take it as a love story set in the revolutionary period and try to ignore the political bias. Jeeze, you'd think he'd have shown more gratitude having been pardoned by Lázaro Cárdenas for his treason. Pedro Armendáriz, María Felix and the town of Cholula were the great stars of this film. The exteriors were certainly shot in Cholula. There were some snippets of revolutionary period music (La Adelita and El Tren) and an anachronistic performance of Malageña Salerosa when he had mariachi serenade María Felix. That song is so lovely, I didn't mind.",
         "The time is 1821, and Mexican revolutionary Jose Juan Reyes (the handsome and formidable Pedro Armendariz) rides into the town of Cholula. He immediately rounds up the local bourgeoisie, with the intention of using those who are useful and disposing of the rest, including those who profess a dishonest attachment to the Revolution. He doesn't count on two factors: the moral intervention of his old seminary chum Rafael (Fernando Fernandez) and the burning hot contempt of a beautiful rich young thing (Maria Felix). The film starts off with a bang, and an extended early scene between Armendariz and Fernandez seems to imply the film will be a lengthy and earnest dissertation on Mexican political philosophy. Once Felix puts in an appearance, however, the film veers off in a slightly different direction, with some amusing comic romance scenes playing out between the rich man's daughter and the powerful general. It goes without saying that Enamorada was well shot by the great Gabriel Figueroa, and magnificent character actor Miguel Inclan (the blind man in Los Olvidados) has fun with his role as Reyes' loyal flunky Bocanegra (though not as much fun as he had in Fernandez' superior La Perla!). Though a little light on substance, Enamorada is still a very worthwhile motion picture.",
         "Romantic melodrama at its best, if you ask me! I still remember the reaction of the international audience who saw this motion picture as part of the homage to Fernández in La Habana Film Festival, half a century after its original release: as the word \"Fin\" appeared on the screen, people stood up and applauded in a mix of emotion, humor and excitement. Because watching a celebrity as \"La Doña\" hit the dusty road as a common soldadera, following the officer she loves during Mexican revolution in 1910, is something to cherish, laugh at and applaud. In Cholula, a general falls for the beautiful, haughty daughter of a landowner, engaged to an American, so it is \"The Taming of the Shrew\" time once again. And believe me, it is a pleasure to watch the duel between Félix and Armendáriz as the Trío Calaveras sings. Ariel Awards for Best Direction, Actress, Cinematography (Gabriel Figueroa), Film Editing, sound and new actor (Eduardo Arozamena). A special Golden Ariel was given to director Fernández."
