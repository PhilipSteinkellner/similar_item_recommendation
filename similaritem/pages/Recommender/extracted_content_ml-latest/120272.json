      "synopsis": "It is December 31, 1982, and the Saturn Theater is preparing for its big New Years Eve concert. The show's midnight finale is having technical problems that narrowly avoid injuring owner and master showman Max Wolfe ( Allen Garfield, credited as Allen Goorwitz), who has operated the Saturn since 1968. Fortunately stage manager Neil Allen ( Daniel Stern) is on the job. Then former stage manager Willy Loman ( Gail Edwards) shows up, and to Neil's chagrin Max refers to her as \"the best in the business.\" Max Wolfe holds a 30-year lease to the theater, but his toadying nephew Sammy ( Miles Chapin) has other ideas. Reptilian concert promoter Colin Beverly ( Ed Begley, Jr., wearing a white polyester jumpsuit) arrives with his henchmen Mark and Marv (former teen heartthrobs Bobby Sherman and Fabian), who parrot their boss's every assertion with a slight paraphrase. Beverly offers to buy Max out of his lease with what seems to be a sweetheart deal at Beverly's concert auditorium and stadium, but Max refuses. Colin Beverly, cementing his role as the evil villain, replies, \"This building is coming down and eighty-eight stories are going up. So f--k you and f--k rock and roll.\" Max, incensed, lunges at Beverly, only to collapse of an apparent heart attack. Outside, Sammy informs Beverly that he stands to inherit the theater from his uncle, and Beverly embraces Sammy as a new ally. He offers Sammy the same deal he offered Max -- if Sammy can get Max's signature on an agreement to transfer the Saturn's lease before midnight. Dr. Carver ( Paul Bartel) arrives to check on Max, and advises bed rest. Meanwhile, one of the stagehands is stealing drugs from the doctor's bag. Coming up with only aspirin, cortizone, and suppositories, he laments that they have \"too much work and not much time... what we need is something that's going to blast us into the fast lane.\" With a flash of light, a cloud of smoke, and the strains of Adrian Belew's \"Big Electric Cat\", Electric Larry suddenly appears -- a seven-foot-tall man with no face and glowing red eyes, wearing a flat-brimmed pimp's hat with mirrored band and a silver trench coat, and carrying a chrome attaché case. He waves a gloved hand over the case and it magically opens to reveal a stash of pills of every conceivable shape and color, and suddenly the stage is alive with artificially sped-up activity. The various performers for the show are introduced: * Captain Cloud and the Rainbow Telegraph, Max Wolfe's favorite band, arrive in an aging bus that is painted à la the Merry Pranksters' Furthur. The Captain (the Turtles' Howard Kaylan) is carrying a backstage pass for New Years 1969, not 1983, but no matter -- Max gives him the finale for old times' sake. Captain Cloud replies blissfully with one of his many tripped-out-guru epigrams: \"The end is always a new beginning.\" * Nada arrives in a battered 1957 Chevy Belair, and her entire 15-member band piles out of the back seat in a \"clown car\" gag. The band is an amalgam of many disparate styles of music that appeared on MTV in the early 1980s -- part bubble-gum pop, part New Wave, part garage rock. Locked in the trunk is \"Special Guest Star\" Piggy ( Lee Ving of the L.A. punk band Fear), a self-destructive, anarchistic punk -- with an articulate knowledge of music business contract terminology. * King Blues, the King of the Blues ( Bill Henderson), a spoof of Muddy Waters. Although he is a kindly man, King Blues' opinion of himself is so great that a eulogy for a fellow bluesman ends with the King threatening God \"you better take care of him, or I'm going to wax your ass.\" * Auden ( Lou Reed), \"metaphysical folk singer, event of the '70s, [and] antisocial recluse,\" hasn't been heard from in six years -- but Max is certain he can convince him to play the Saturn, since he's \"calling from his deathbed.\" Auden answers the phone in a shot that mimics perfectly the cover of Bob Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home, except that everything, including the woman lounging on the couch, is covered in cobwebs. Hearing that Max is making \"a deathbed request,\" Auden bursts into song (using that phrase as a lyric) and decides \"there's a concept album in this, I'll be right over.\" He hops into a cab and tells the driver to \"take the scenic route, I got some things to work out.\" * Reggie Wanker ( Malcolm McDowell), \"20 years of rock and roll and still on top\", is a Mick Jagger spoof with his own private jet and a countess for a girlfriend. Years of fan adoration (and drug use) have left Reggie jaded, bored, and uninspired with his life as the ultimate rock star. The new by-the-book fire inspector, Connell O'Connell ( Robert Picardo), arrives and informs Neil that no fireworks and no open flames will be permitted in the theater. Max and Neil give a brief pep talk to the Saturn staff, then the doors are opened and the audience streams in. While the ushers (including Clint Howard) take pains to search everyone and begin to accumulate a massive stockpile of confiscated contraband -- including kegs, firearms, and a 500-pound bomb -- they seem oblivious to the seven-foot tall walking marijuana joint that enters excitedly, accompanied by two Rastafarians. King Blues opens the show, performing two of his \"own\" hit songs, \"The Blues Had A Baby and They Named It Rock and Roll\" (by Muddy Waters) and \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" (by Willie Dixon). Next the Nada Band take the stage and perform \"I'm Not Going to Take It No More.\" Piggy leads the band in a viciously punk-rock version of \"Hoochie Coochie Man,\" complete with stage dives and slam dancing, and King Blues recognizes it from its opening notes. He appraises Piggy's rendition warmly, saying, \"Who said a white boy can't sing the blues?\" After their set, Nada, Piggy and the band return triumphantly to their dressing room, only to be disappointed by the poor selection of refreshments. Nada says, \"champagne again?\" which cues Electric Larry to reappear; this time his attaché case contains a large rock of cocaine, which grinds itself into powder and distributes into neat lines with a wave of Larry's hand. Piggy, inexplicably, panics at the sight of Larry and flees the room. Reggie Wanker heads for the stage, while fires of appreciation (many of them much bigger than the concert-cliché upraised lighter) burn throughout the audience. At the same time, the fire inspector is chasing the giant joint, now partially burned down, through the mezzanine with a fire extinguisher. As the show proceeds, Sammy tries to find ways to sabotage the theater, including fueling a fire in the basement and cutting the fire hose. Neil and Willy manage to put the fire out by connecting their hose to a water pipe in the dreaded mens' room. Mark and Marv give Sammy a bomb, which he plants in the rocket ship that Max will ride during the final countdown to midnight. Reggie sings a celebration of egotism, \"Hot Shot,\" then moves on to a version of \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" (leading King Blues to \"bask in my own genius.\") During his set Reggie sets off fireworks, and the fire inspector (now in the audience) rushes the stage. The bass player hits the inspector with his guitar and kicks him off the stage, a reference to Pete Townshend's treatment of Abbie Hoffman at Woodstock. The inspector runs backstage, where he collides with Sammy (who is fleeing the impending bomb). Both are knocked unconscious and fall to the ground. Electric Larry, unbidden, shows up for the third and final time to squirt an eyedropper of clear liquid (presumably LSD) into the tank of the water cooler. He delivers his only line -- \"Happy new year\" -- and vanishes. Moments later the inspector and Sammy are revived and drink water from the cooler, which almost immediately gives them animated rainbow visions. The inspector is last seen spraying his fire extinguisher at random, seeing fires everywhere, while Sammy abandons his greedy persona and starts giving away his material possessions. Willy overhears Mark and Marv talking about the bomb, and is captured by them and Colin Beverly. They lock her in the trunk of Beverly's limo and drive off. Auden, still riding in the taxi cab, realizes that day has turned to night and orders the driver to \"step on it.\" The cab soon collides with Beverly's limo, which releases Willy, who escapes and runs back toward the theater. During a ridiculously extended drum solo, Reggie has returned to his dressing room for an interlude with about a dozen half-naked groupies. His girlfriend, Countess Chantamina ( Anna Bjorn), discovers his infidelity and invites the nerdy, virginal stage hand Joey ( Dan Frischman) into another dressing room as an act of retribution. Reggie finds them and, feeling betrayed, returns to the stage to deliver a heartfelt ballad reprise of \"Hot Shot.\" As the song ends, Reggie walks backstage, where he asks Neil for a glass of water -- which comes from the now-magical water cooler. Left wanting an encore from Reggie, the audience begins to get unruly, so Neil puts on a cartoon -- a black-and-white print of the 1935 Technicolor short The Sunshine Makers. Meanwhile, Reggie heads to the bathroom, where his penis initiates a conversation with him, explaining that tonight's performance was Reggie's greatest because it had emotion. Reggie decides to name his penis as his band's new manager, telling his bandmate Toad (the Doors' John Densmore), \"Rock and roll is going to be fun again.\" Only a few minutes before midnight, Willy reaches the theater and tells Neil about the bomb. With the help of Captain Cloud, Neil learns from Sammy where the bomb is hidden, and he radios up to Max, who is already riding the booby-trapped rocket ship down a wire from the upper reaches of the theater. Max finds the bomb and tries to throw it to Neil, but instead it lands in the crowd, which tosses it playfully, as if it is yet another concert beach ball -- overhead from person to person. As the crowd counts down the final ten seconds, the bomb makes its way out of the main hall, through the lobby, and out the front door. Just as Colin Beverly's limo pulls up to the curb, the bomb is tossed into it -- and the last second ticks away. There is a big explosion, everyone shouts \"happy new year,\" and Captain Cloud leads them all in \"Auld Lang Syne\". Beverly, Mark and Marv crash through a skylight, relatively unharmed, and the celebration ends happily. As the last of the audience leaves, Auden finally arrives, having paid a cab fare of $11,864.90 with the cash in his pocket. Neil introduces Auden to his younger sister, Susie ( Stacey Nelkin), who is a big fan. Max gives Neil the lease to the theater, saying he intends to retire. Neil offers partnership to Willy. The end credits roll, while Auden sings Reed's \"Little Sister\" to an audience of three: Susie... and in the balcony, the giant joint and a lonely German Shepherd guide dog. The final caption reads, \"Thanks for the memories to the entire staff of the Fillmore East 1968-71.\"",

         "\"Get Crazy\" is as '80s as a Flock Of Seagulls haircut or a Ms. Pac Man machine, but when people talk about the decade, for some strange reason it's off everyone's radar screen. No one mentions it when you talk about cool '80s cinema, but it's better than a pack of \"Fast Times\" or a pair of \"Breakfast Clubs\" for my money. It's a rare thing to see three such beauties as Gail Edwards, Stacy Nelkin, and Anna Bjorn all adorning the same film, but who on Earth in 1983 could have thought it would be the career highpoint for all three of them? Why isn't Malcolm McDowell's fantastically hilarious Mick Jagger send-up as celebrated as Bill Murray's Carl Spackler in \"Caddyshack?\" What more evidence do you need that life's unfair! How about one of the zaniest films since \"Hard Day's Night\" celebrating rock 'n roll passing though the chasm of time with barely a whisper of recognition? Ouch! Okay, I'm through ranting. Since you are reading this, you don't deserve this spiel. You care enough to look through these reviews. Perhaps you even managed to find a copy of the film, which may be like climbing K2 for video collectors, forget DVD. Here's why \"Get Crazy\" is worth your time. 1. Killer songs - \"Hot Shot\" and \"Take It No More\" are pretty boss send-ups of hard rock and new wave from the period. The latter even has some great Shirelles-style harmonies and sax breaks, very B52s. 2. Spot-on sendups - McDowell is great as Reggie, even his last name is a funny dig at the head Stone. Strutting onstage with a giant codpiece and frilly tunic, McDowell has a lot of fun playing it very silly for a change, and the results suit him. It's great to see such a fine actor cutting up. 3. Goofy set pieces - I like the bit where King Blues is at the graveyard ceremony for his blues musician friend, and every other mourner is blind! Or when Reggie prods his girlfriend with a lobster claw. When we first see Lou Reed as the Dylan send-up Auden, he's lounging in the same pose and background as Dylan's \"Bringing It All Back Home\" album cover except everything's covered in cobwebs, including the girl with the ciggie! You have to watch this film a few times to pick up even most of the craziness. 4. Political incorrectness - You want sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll? \"Get Crazy\" has it. There's walking joints, ganja so potent it can suspend 220-pound blues legends in midair, and a strange thin man with no face and a suitcase stocked with pharmaceutical cornucopia. And plenty of nudity, even one actress in a bathtub playing a high school girl. Yet you can't really hold it against \"Get Crazy,\" because the sex and drugs are there for jokes rather than titillation, sending up the lifestyle we all associate with the music. 5. Relevance to the time - The 80s were the decade of greed and ugly silver-plastic pants, so who is a better movie villain than Colin Beverly? He's played to perfection by Ed Begley Jr., star of such sleazy late-night R-rated period fare as \"Private Lessons\" and \"Eating Raoul\" and just oozing corruption from every pore. The clash of cultures between Beverly and Allan Garfield's idealistic Max Wolfe, owner of the Saturn Theater and hero of our story, makes for a nice microcosm of the period. It's like Michael Douglas taking on Martin Sheen in \"Wall Street,\" only with some drop-dead bass guitar underneath. And then there's the other culture clash, that of New Wave performer Nada (Lori Eastside crossing Joan Jett with Toni Basil) and McDowell's take on Jagger's \"Emotional Rescue\" period, including a Keef substitute in John Densmore playing drums. \"Get Crazy\" can be sad to watch. The director, Allan Arkush, had a lot of talent we never really got to see again because of this film's unfair fate. Likewise, it has too many good actors who never got another serious chance. There's also an eerie opening where Wolfe, riding a flying machine, crashes into an electrical apparatus, which is exactly how Wolfe's real-life basis Bill Graham died years later. But otherwise this film is just a ton of fun, a time capsule that hasn't gotten a minute older for all the New Years that have passed between then and now.",
         "This is one of the most under viewed movies I can think of. If you have a sense of humor about musicians and their lifestyles, this is a great watch. I recommend this as the second feature on a double bill with 'This is Spinal Tap'. This movie is funnier than many 'A' list comedies and should have a larger fan base. Check it out.",
         "I laughed my butt off when I first saw this flick in college. The parodies of famous rock stars (courtesy of Malcolm McDowell), punk rock, and blues artists was very well done. The drug jokes (one guy sneaking into the theatre dressed as a joint, the magic water) were absolutely hilarious for their time. One of my favorites was when several different versions of \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" were performed onstage. King Blues opened the set with a Jewish backup band; I rolled on the floor laughing as Blues was frustrated over the band sent to perform with him. Once King Blues was finished, the band Nada (featuring Lee Ving as Piggy) blitzed their way through a fast, furious, and very impassioned rendition. Piggy was a definite show-stealer as Nada'a masochistic lead singer! Ah, then Reggie Wanker steps onstage and does his slick version. The Wanker almost falls flat but is saved by a ripping drum solo by Doors beatmeister John Densmore. Another scene which got me laughing was when Reggie Wanker started listening to his private member...I always thought listening to IT would get me in trouble, but it saved Wanker's career! Lou Reed, in a Dylanesque role, was wonderful as the singer/songwriter Auden who uses the scenic route on a cab to give him inspiration for his music. Don't try to think your way through this movie...just sit back, put your mind on cruise control, and enjoy the ride!!!",
         "When I was about 13 I saw this on TV and afterwards kicked myself for not having taped it. Some years later while travelling I saw it through a video store window and, well, flipped out. After getting home I called up my estranged father and blackmailed him into buying it for me. The video title has a very unfortunate Finnish translation (which translates back to \"Star Gang\")and the absence of letterboxing results in booms aplenty, but NOTHING can ruin my joy of watching this movie again and again!",
         "Malcolm MacDowell is an incredible actor with cohones of steel. Just seeing him take the risk of playing an aging hard-rocker and actually singing is just unbelievable. Playing off Daniel Stern with the line from Blue Thunder \"Catch you later\" with the forefinger pointed like a gun was just too cool. Electric Larry was too much like people I went to high school with. I died watching this film.",
         "Yes, this video (DVD? Dream on!) is tough to find, but definitely worth it! I haven't checked Netflix--my source for easy access to some obscure entertainment--but I'm betting you just can't find it for rent these days. I agree with the review, in all its enthusiasm and detail. This really is a time capsule--but unlike traditional capsules, this one doesn't get stale the second--or third, fifth, tenth...-- time you peruse the contents! Today's Lou Reed is way too serious (what did you feed him full of anyway, Laurie Anderson?!?), so this is a great look back on my musical hero when he was still a real person. Love his unresolved meditation on \"It's a Deathbed Request.\" But you're sure to find resolution among the various takes on a favorite blues standard. Arena rock, punk, beyond-punk, blooos--take yer pick. You'll love the interpretations. So--begin your search, and prepare for some great watchin'!",
         "This movie is a great parody! I love it! Being a musician I loved how all the acts play off King Blues. Lee Ving is Piggy and is at his best in this movie. Malcolm Mcdowell plays the part of the Egotistical Rock Star as only he can. Howard Kaylan of Flo and Eddie (AKA the Turtles) plays a great parody of Jerry Garcia. Fabian and Bobby Sherman make great henchmen for bad guy Colin (Ed Begley Jr.) Lou Reed As Folk Singer Auden is eccentric and closes the movie as only he can. Director Allan Arkush captures the world of Rock Concerts perfectly with all the characters you would fine at any event. If you can't tell I love this movie. A must see for any rocker who enjoys a good comedy about the industry. Needs to be on DVD!!",
         "Over the years I have probably viewed this picture about 20 times, and I really don't get tired of it. It is so full of silly things, injokes about the Rock n Roll 'thing' and absolutely outrageous performances that it is always fun to watch and to show to friends. Malcolm McDowell's scene-chewing Jagger-Bowie character of Reggie Wanker is an absolute highlight and look for some amazing personalities in roles in this movie. This is one that never loses its charm.",
         "I can't say enough good about this one. If you've ever tried to perform live, under pressure, with everything going wrong around you - I don't care if it's a high school play or Madison Square opening for the Megaband of the Minute - you'll identify with this. Lou Reed gets to play himself, basically; the hippy bands of the 60s that just won't leave are portrayed as they are (and this was 1983, for Pete's sake, never mind 2006!), the ego-glamrockers get their due with Malcom MacDowel, The punkers have their turn, and the blues godfather kind of watches it all from the wings. My favorite scene is at the beginning at a bluesman's funeral - King Blues does the graveside eulogy, in which he says, among other things, ...\"You were the greatest...musician, drinker of whiskey, and lover of women (minister starting to wince at this point)... 'God, this is my man, and if you don't take care of him, I'm gonna wax your a_s!\" - thunder rumbles, minister backs away from the grave, and the blind a capella blues singers who've been crooning away all through the scene start bumping into each other, saying \"'scuse me, scuse me\" - one of them falls in the grave and yells \"I'M NOT DEAD!!!!\" - OK, it loses in telling - just get the film and enjoy!",
         "I first saw this film over ten years ago, and still think this is the ultimate drugs, sex and rock and roll picture ever made, and certainly one of the funniest films I'ver ever seen. It's a bit dated now, but I agree with one writer who called it \"the funniest film most people haven't seen.\""
