         "I mean one always wonders who these people are who watch infomercials for 30 minutes at a time. Well, here is our answer. It is more fun and interesting to watch an infomercial compared to this. I do give three stars for the hardbods and the chick who promises sex to the ski-doo race winner, but what a tease this movie is. Give me a break. Show us what we want to see! So a tease, no real action, the story is clichéd and a corrupt copper... OK whatever",
         "Heaps of potential wasted. You have cute chicks, they are thin and have long hair, there is a bikini contest announced, everyone is on vacation (except one who is in grief so can be made happy) and what does this movie do? Next to nothing with it. The problem with this film was they bought into their own silly idea and title and left the bride at the altar.",
         "The cleavage and hard bodies are spectacular and promising but the promise of a bikini contest never materializes and there are no women being natural and flaunting their bodies and no sex. It is almost like a Taliban/Republican ski resort. Otherwise, the story is a joke, the 'so-called' sharks look like rubber duckies and just when someone yells 'movement alerts them, they all... move! Opposite of Simon Says!!! I did enjoy that the sheriff leaves all his guns and machine guns (!!!) hanging out available on the wall and that the 'Japanese' woman cannot even pronounce the simplest of Japanese words anywhere near a Japanese person... Guys, just give us the T&A and we will watch and enjoy... what is all this other stuff? Hoorah for thin, flaunting women who spread it.",
         "Avalanche Sharks is a stupid film, plain and simple. Its characters have no characteristics beyond the surface. We have the corrupt sheriff, the greedy businessman, the tired sheriff, the virgin, the foreign and a whole cavalcade of empty-headed, teenage idiots. And even then the premise is stupider, which is saying something. It's basically Sharknado with the tornado being replaced with a skiing resort. And the worst insult is that they try to force in a half-baked origin story for these sharks. And it doesn't convince or work, at all. The movie is really nothing more than a gorefest without the budget to pull of the blood carnage convincingly. The actors do their jobs merely to get paid, which means that we don't care what happens to them. The special effects are just sad to look and the story has no impact behind it, especially when the ending solution is so laughably deus ex machina. Don't see this film. Sometimes films like this have a certain \"so bad it's good\" quality, but this is just pathetic. Besides, I was promised a bikini skiing contest. And they never delivered. Unforgivable!",
         "To be honest, I suffered through watching most of this movie here and there throughout the past year or so whenever it was airing on television. Although there was worldwide shock and awe with Sharknado (which was so cheesy and irrational that it was funny), they should have kept it at that and left it as a classic cheesy movie. But no, instead they start creating a whole bunch of shark movies...so much so, that the original value of Sharknado is now lost. Avalanche Sharks is obviously a very cheesy film. But of all cheesy films, it is horribly executed. The CGI is terrible, and the story is just a piece of garbage. To be honest, how can you even imagine sharks living in the snow? At least with Sharknado, they were picked up and tossed around in the tornadoes to terrorize people in the city. Here, sharks are swimming in snow...do the writers even have brains? Anyway, if you're looking for a cheesy movie, this one delivers for the first few minutes. After that, it loses its charm, if there was any in the first place. This Sharknado spin-off is definitely a disaster worse than any avalanche could ever pull off.",
         "A remote ski resort is terrorized by prehistoric man eating sharks after an avalanche. Yes really! I'm been trying to figure out what makes a good bad movie (Sharknado) vs. a bad, bad movie (Avalanche Sharks)? I mean they're both B movies you watch for a laugh in a so-bad-its-good kinda way. They're also both about equal in terms of acting, direction, plot and special effects. Yet somehow Sharknado was fun to watch whereas Avalanche Sharks was just unwatchable. In the end I made it through about half of this, I mean I had to see a few attacks, but the CGI is poorly (cheaply) done and while this is just a crappy B movie I still wanted a bit of an explanation as to how/why there were sharks living in the snow -they apparently came from space. I still had fun guessing who gets eaten first and how; the babes getting it in the hot tub, the dude with the snow blower or the girls running from the advancing fin cruising through the snow. After the initial curiosity wears off though there's not much left. 01.02.14",
         "I knew this was going to be bad but I had NO idea just how bad. The whole idea was of course retarded but on top of that, the acting was terrible too. The whole thing looked like it was made by guys who do really cheap TV ads, you know, like ads for 'Ed and Melna's Furniture Emporium' with a cheesy logo effect. Man, the effects are REALLY bad, nothing even looks slightly real. There's one whole section I'm sure was all stock video footage of people snowboarding, it didn't even match the 'look' of rest of the movie, I thought it was a commercial at first, it probably was, it was probably a bunch of stuff they shot for a sporting goods store that went out of business. I'm just amazed these movies are getting made and put on TV. I really wonder if we're witnessing the end of television. Perhaps the internet has killed TV too. Maybe there's just not enough money in it anymore to make anything except 'reality' shows and terrible 'movies' like this one.",
         "I heard this movie was bad, but I wanted to see for myself. It was worse then bad it was the stupidest movie I have ever seen. The acting sucked and the effects were absolutely horrible ! Do not rent this movie, do not waste your time watching it or you will regret it. I sometimes can watch stupid movies just for a good laugh but this one isn't at all funny. Mildly gross now and then. It may make you jump a couple of times. But it lacks in many many different areas. Once in a while they throw in a crazy person to get your attention but overall it can hardly hold your attention. I find myself doing various chores around the house while it was on cause it was becoming so boring and predictable. Please never make another movie like this one. Sharks belong in the water please give them the respect they deserve by not being a part of this ridiculous movie.",
         "Much similar in concept to the 2011 movie \"Sand Sharks\", which was also referenced in this movie, \"Avalanche Sharks\" is exactly what the name indicates. Well, without the avalanche, and just throw in snow instead. Yep, sharks swimming through snow and eating people. But these are no ordinary snow-swimming sharks, no... These are ethereal man-killers, brought about by ancient native American traditions. The storyline is simple and straight forward; a bunch of people are enjoying spring break at a mountain skiing resort, when an ancient curse of sorts is set free and spirit sharks are set free to feast on the hapless vacationers. For a storyline as this, you know what you get, and there are no great surprises here. And of course, it is as outrageous and far from realistic as it can be. But what do you expect with a concept such as this? I will say that the special effects crew actually managed to pull it off nicely throughout \"Avalanche Sharks\". The sharks looked interesting and had some great details, and the effects themselves were good and seems real enough. And that really brought about a great deal of the enjoyment of the movie - as the storyline is a no brainer, and the acting was, well, it was there, lets just say that much... \"Avalanche Sharks\" is a movie that is perfect for a lazy day on the couch, especially if you are nurturing a hangover and want to have some simple entertainment that require absolutely no brain activity. So there has been sand sharks, swamp sharks, ghost sharks, super sharks, sharknados, avalanche sharks, and many, many other types of sharks, so where do we go next? Traffic sharks? Concrete Sharks? Space sharks? Unleash those toothy swimmers, and we, the audience, will be there to watch what is next...",
         "What is there to really say about Avalanche Sharks? The premise is ridiculous and so, duly, is the execution. There is a mountain and there are ghost sharks (possibly, not quite sure about the precise ontology of the sharks), and there are numerous victims of said spectral fish. At the most obvious level the film is entertaining as a cheap and poorly-conceived cash-in on the 'where-is-the-most-unlikely-place-a-shark-can-strike-from' low budget mania that has emerged of late, and on that premise it is worth a watch. However, the film has no real logic and is ultimately really random in its approach. For instance, the film opens with three distinctive characters, but then pretty much forgets about them, and the climax is perhaps the most random solution I've ever seen (also involving a very random character). And what of the characters? Well, you get a marine biologist who never utters anything remotely biological (and sharks on a mountain really should pique at least some professional interest, regardless of the tragic back-story), the usual unscrupulous mayor/businessman who won't close the mountain, a ranting 'You're all doomed!\" old mountain man, and a hilarious 'marine' who keeps telling people that he is a marine (but who displays very little military prowess). Oh, and one of the best performances I have seen in a film of this type: a man who, as a result of seeing his girlfriend eaten by the sharks, has a religious epiphany and renounces drugs in favour of universal love (I'll leave it to you to see how that pans out). However, the CGI is actually not too bad at all and nobody is taking the proceedings very seriously (except the marine character, boy, he takes things seriously). All in all, then, the bar is set low, but with a title like Avalanche Sharks, what do you expect?",
         "Seeing this film with only 2 stars on IMDb made me sad. Sure, this isn't a film that most will mention in the same breath as most big-budget wide-releases, but this film was, unlike too many of those films, truly enjoyable from beginning to end! The film-makers and actors knew their limitations - technical and personal - and with tongues planted firmly in cheek, gave viewers a more than competent production that kept my attention at the way through and left me more that satisfied when over. The script, direction and acting were decent all-around, and I can't recall any specific scene in the film that suddenly took me out of the story. Nothing seemed forced and nobody seemed to be trying to go above their means. While the CGI special-effects are what they are - CGI - the film-makers smartly decided to limit its use, with the effects either ending abruptly or the scenes cutting away quickly. Most of these scenes are shark attacks after all, which would naturally be quick and abrupt. Some people have problems with films not explaining enough about certain things. In this case, viewers are given two possibilities as to the origins of the titular sharks. But, do we really need everything to be explained to us (especially in a movie like this) to enjoy a film? Questions can lead to debate after all and, in my opinion, can add extra layers to a film. And this is a film that most would not expect to have much substance to begin with. (The last big-budget film I saw at the cinema left me with nothing to think about when it was over. Duh...) I really liked how they framed the beginning and end of the film. Original, funny, and a nice change of pace from most films. This production truly impressed me, and I look forward to what all the people involved bring to movie lovers in the future. Give this film a chance. Don't go into it expecting anything in particular (my advice for seeing any film - big or small) and you'll likely find yourself pleasantly surprised by how much more FUN you'll have. P.S. Apparently, Brooke Hogan was up for a role in this film but had to step away for some reason or another. I don't want to sound harsh, but I'm glad she wasn't involved, because I can't help but think she may have stuck out like a sore thumb acting-wise compared to the subdued but competent performances by most of the cast. Sorry, Brooke... :^/",
         "I've seen a lot of bad shark movies, but this one was only partially likable. The main premise that made me watch it was the bikini contest they talk about, but there's no bikini contest. Yes, there are a few girls in skimpy clothes, and while they were hot, them walking around didn't exactly fit the idea of a bikini contest. So I give it a bad score for really false advertising--though the rest of the movie was pretty much what I expected, so there is that. Plot: 6/10 People at a ski resort are attacked by the spirits of sharks that were summoned hundreds of years ago. That would have been a better description than talking about a bikini contest that never happened. Character Development: 4/10 Can't really say much on this because there was very little character development. I mean, less than there usually is in these kinds of movies, and I've seen quite a few movies like this one. Half the cast looked alike so it was hard to keep track of who was who. Direction: 6/10 The way the story was told wasn't completely horrible, after all we did get to see people eaten by sharks while skiing and snowboarding. It was also good that they did figure out a way to get beautiful girls to strip down to their bikinis. Kudos for that. I just wish there had been an actual contest. Casting: 7/10 The cast were all beautiful and handsome, just too bad you couldn't really tell one blonde from another. There was one girl introduced at the start of the movie and I didn't realize that they actually kept showing her until right before her character died. Acting: 6/10 Not bad but not great, either. Typical for this movie. Cinematography: 9/10 Beautiful scenery, great shots of the girls, and even the special effects weren't bad. Can't really go wrong with this movie visually. Music: 9/10 Music was pretty good, especially the end song. Pacing: 7/10 First thirty minutes of this movie felt like an hour to me. Rest finished up okay, though. Sets and Costumes: 8/10 Girls, bikinis, ski resort--what else is there to say? Re-Watchability: 5/10 Probably not going to watch this one again, but I might. Depends on if I decide to give it another try or not. Final Score: 67/100 6.7/10 C-",
         "This is literally the worst movie I've ever seen. I didn't even have to watch the whole movie (which I didn't ) to tell you that this is a terrible movie. So when the main character was attacked by a shark, and the shark suddenly disappeared, how did the main character survived? I mean, he should've been ripped into half, right? The shark should chew before it swallows, right? Or at least make a bite? How could his wound look like scratches like he just fell down from somewhere high instead I'd being eaten by a freaking shark? And that man who actually DID get ripped into half? How could anyone be so calm and not showing any pain when he just lost half of his body? I'm pretty sure I couldn't. Much less telling jokes and being funny. And they didn't explain how the shark came out in the ending, because I thought they're all gone when that random person propped those random things up. And I think I don't have to mention the sh*tty special effects of this movie. So, believe me when I say this movie is literally one of the worst movies ever made.",
         "It's been a while since my last review. And starting again I figured I didn't want to pick up a blockbuster but a title by which you know, this isn't going to be that good but will offer a few things. So far i have seen them all concerning mega monsters like spiders and other stuff but Snow Sharks was sadly a waist of time. As I said earlier, I don't have problems with creature features that are over the top but there must be an actual storyline and if you are using effects that are cheap at least don't show how it is done. When one of the girls is being bitten in two by a Snow Shark they do close in with the camera but you could easily spot here legs just being covered by the snow, you could even see them move. A really bad thing. Of course the sharks are cheap CGI but they do look rather good. On part of the storyline itself there's something to say about that too. In fact there isn't any. You move from one part to another and nothing binds them. Then you have the nerd trying to seduce girls but that doesn't work out, up to the next scene. Then you have the Asian girl coming into the story and pulling up crosses in the snow, Why she does that and why the crosses are there is never explained but they do things with the sharks. 3 girls are in a hot tub, why, no reason at all, and you can see it coming, they are shark foot, sharks appearing in the tub and the water doesn't run out of it, strange. We also see a lot of skiing and snow boarding which looks nice but doesn't add anything to the story. Yes, this is just a mishmash of ideas, sadly,bad ideas that doesn't work out. All the girls do look pretty and some do walk around in small bikini's but that doesn't make a flick and when you are teasing with nudity then give it to the people. No, this I can't recommend to anybody, not even the Z-flick lovers. Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 1/5 Story 1/5 Comedy 0/5",
         "If you are looking for story, plot, excitement, adventure, depth of character then this isn't the movie for you. It's exactly what it says on the tin, tongue in cheek nonsense. Any film that dares to pair the word 'Shark' with a destructive force driven by snow deserves our respect. There's good old fashioned story-telling and then there's this, suspend your imagination and your cognitive abilities and sit back and enjoy the ride. Looking forward to the next instalment, 'Shark Eruption' or 'Shark Thunderstorm', the plot lines here are limitless.",
         "When I first heard of the film I had much doubt, I was thinking a shark that swims through the snow is an awful idea. After I watched the film I was definitely wrong. This film is even better than the original jaws films. The suspense is surreal and the acting is outstanding that I am surprised such a film has not won numerous Oscars so far. People who give this bad reviews point out the tiny obsolete flaws that they can find. When I watch this I ignore those minor flaws and focus on the great camera angles and shots, the brilliant acting, the fantastic story. This is one of my all-time favourite films and I highly recommend it to anyone.",
         "\"Avalanche Sharks\" tells the story of a bikini contest that turns into a horrifying affair when it is hit by a shark avalanche. Checking this film on IMDb in June 2015, and you will see it hovering around a 2.1 out of 10. That, obviously, is pretty awful. But that also is incredibly inaccurate and unfair. Not that this is a masterpiece, but compared to thousands of other low budget films in recent years, it has a certain charm to it. Sure, the acting is a bit weak, and the military character is an awful stereotype... and the music is repetitive... and the special effects are cheap. But if you went into this expecting anything different, you have much too high of expectations for a film called \"Avalanche Sharks\". Because that is the whole point of the movie: sharks in the snow. And what more could you want than that? I suppose more sharks. But the very concept is brilliant and do not be surprised if you see this getting remade down the road with a bigger budget. Noteworthy: the mysterious Max Nikoff was on this production in the sound department. The world is still wondering who this Nikoff is, who claims to have fled the Soviet Union and took up movie making under the wing of Ulli Lommel...",
         "Ah, sharks\u0085 Once upon a time they were considered the most fearsome and menacing real-life monsters of the horror movie industry. In the 70s almost everyone was afraid to go into the water thanks to the impact of a certain shark film classic. In the 80s the success of \"Jaws\" got plagiarized endlessly and all types of crazy sea monsters emerged from the depths. In the late 90s/early 2000s practically all shark movies sucked (\"Deep Blue Sea\", \"Shark Attack\") but at least they dealt with traditional types of sharks. Somewhere in the new millennium, however, the whole sub-genre derailed entirely. Shark movies have turned into a playground for lousy and deliberately fake-looking digital effects and there seemingly exists some sort of competition among bad production companies about who can come up with the most ridicule and grotesque concept. If this really is a contest, I've seen many potential winners already: \"Two-Headed Shark Attack\", \"Sharktopus\", \"Sand Sharks\", \"Dinoshark\" and \u2013 of course \u2013 those imbecilic \"Sharknado\" movies. Obviously you can't be too skeptical when you're reviewing this type of shark movies, because you very well know in advance what you're getting. Same goes for this title. If you don't want to get irritated by inept plotting, abysmal acting, juvenile humor or amateurish special effects, you simply don't watch a dud called \"Avalanche Sharks\". Yes, we are talking about a film script where giant sharks swim through and jump out of snow \u2013 even though sometimes this snow is only a few inches thick \u2013 and devour horny boys and bikini-clad girls that are spending their spring break holiday at a skiing resort. It even gets better when it turns out that the sharks supposedly represent the vengeful spirits of Native Americans whose tribes were slaughtered here on these mountains. Naturally, if I was a furious dead Indian myself, I would definitely also take on the shape of a glowing blue shark in order to extract my revenge! The script also complies with the biggest clichés of the genre. Of course there's a sleazy mayor as well as an irresponsible resort manager who refuse to shut down the resort because Spring Break is the busiest period of the year, and inevitable there's also a crazy old local yokel yelling out stuff like \"The snow will turn red with blood! You'll see! You'll see!\" This is a really dumb movie and I can't possible award it with a rating higher than 2/10, but in case you manage to switch off all brain functions, it's fairly enjoyable. Last but not least, there's already a suggestion for another totally absurd shark spin-off, namely \"Hot Tub Shark Attack!\"",
         "SyFy creature feature too hard to make yourself believe. Tons of die hard young skiers and snowboarders are ready to party, because once again it it Bikini Ski Day at Mammoth Mountain. Just imagine prehistoric and bloodthirsty snow sharks are awaken and freed by an avalanche. Special effects are as cheesy as the story line. Members of the cast include: Kate Nauta, Kellie Cantwell, Alexander Mendeluk, Erin Ross, Emily Addison, Eric Scott Woods and Benjamin Easterday.",
         "Bad acting, bad script, bad special effects. Bad everything.",
         "A riveting, edge of the seat ride of exhilaration and astonishing special affects, this combined with a cast surely to rival some of the best actors of our times, leaves this mountain romp far, far from anything described in the last sentence. Career desperation drips from the script, and carries through to everyone who was involved, like the gang who watched the ark of the covenant opened (Raiders of the Lost Ark), so will the trajectory of all the careers which contributed to this steaming pile of waist. I base this review on about the first ten minutes I could stand before making the glorious effort to reach for the remote. However, late, late night satellite TV, has to have something to air.",
         "If a zero or negative number rating were possible . . . Well, a \"one\" will have to do here. The absolute worst, below the bottom of the barrel, excruciating embarrassment to filmcraft ever produced . . . far beyond the depths plunged by that timeless classic, \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\". But no, that dubious distinction has now found a new recipient. Hands down, one would have to search far and wide, around the planet to find anything that could possibly outdo this absurdity. A question might be, who in their right mind would ever finance such a disaster? The people who dreamed this up might have been smoking crack or whatever, but the folks who actually financed this??? So . . . what's next, sharks from outer space, sharks coming out of a flying saucer from outer space? Oops, I better not suggest anything here.",
         "This is what happens when a movies like Sharknado 1-3 make money and become successful. Sharknado has spawned more copycats, hopefuls and plain old rip-offs, than any other movie franchise out there. Aside from that, this movie was what you would expect from the title and the rating. Typical B-rated SFX. Typical B-rated script, story and acting. The casting is right out of a B-Horror For Dummies self help book. My opinion of this movie is what I would say about most of these movies, it entertained me enough to watch it until the end. I laughed, I cried, I took a dump. You know, that old chestnut. If you enjoy the genre you don't really need me to tell you anything. This is a B-Horror guide followed step by step. Enjoy.",
         "Avalanche Sharks is not the worst shark movie out there but that in all honesty is saying very little because it is still a big failure on every level. Avalanche Sharks is a cheap-looking movie, granted yes with beautiful scenery(the only halfway-decent asset) but haphazard editing- to overkill effect in the attack scenes and even lousier special effects. Even toy sharks that you can have displayed in the bathroom are scarier than the shark designs here, which look more goofy and ridiculously over-sized than menacing. The sharks have very little personality either, never do they feel a threat all they do is attack without warning, the movie makes an attempt to explain their origins(which already makes it better than some shark movies out there) but it is written very clumsily and doesn't make sense. Despite all this, the they still manage to be much more likable than the human characters, all of whom are tired personality-deprived stereotypes who just frustrate you with their stupid actions and some not adding anything to the story. Every single one of the characters are terribly acted as well. Not that the writing and story are anything to write home about, the dialogue has a lot of repetition and padded filler and reeks of cheese, while the story is predictable, a mish-mash of ideas barely explored and insultingly ridiculous. The attack scenes range from mild fun, real stupidity and drawn-out boredom, most of which falling into the latter two categories, a couple very abrupt and blink-and-you'll miss them too, none of them tense or suspenseful. You can see them coming a mile away as well, and the conclusion is deeply underwhelming and didn't feel like an ending, the sharks are defeated too easily and too much by chance. To be honest though, I was so bored by the overall movie and so frustrated by the characterisation that I couldn't care less about how it ended. Oh and by the way, if you are looking for a bikini contest like promised you are best avoiding Avalanche Sharks, and if you do you are not missing a thing, that is how bad Avalanche Sharks is. 1/10 for the scenery only. Bethany Cox",
         "Most excellent movie about sharks i watch this year. hard to believe most of people give to this piece of art this bad rating. The acting is pretty good most of the character in the movie look like real people acting so naturally cannot be learn in an acting school it just to natural. The mighty ski patrol captain with is Olympic medal is a character i will remember forever And want i can tell about the story background mixing Science fiction with shark this manner if just \u0085. i don't have word to talk about it. The mix about Shark , Mountain trip , Space invasion and native tribe mythology is unforgettable. The old lady part it's a bit troubling we never know if she will survive his husband not helping her so much and we never know who the hell giving to her is box where she got all this stuff. but this part look like make for Canadian people only."
