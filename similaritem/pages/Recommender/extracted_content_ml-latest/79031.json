         "I think most of us hardcore horror fans would agree that the state of most of the horror film industry lately�well, blows. Whether it's a studio film (and those are the worst offenders) or the indies, there is just not a whole lot out there that has made a huge impact on horror fans lately. The high expectations for recent films such as \"The Devil's Rejects\", \"Land of the Dead\", \"The Amityville Horror\" and so many others makes one wonder what is going on with horror these days? Documentarian and creator of the horror magazine \"Are You Going?\", Christopher P. Garetano has put together a fascinating, often irreverent, often deadly serious look at the world of the indie horror movie in his latest film, \"Horror Business\". And horror films fans should really take a look at this one. Garetano spent two years following the exploits and film-making of such indie filmmakers as Ron (\"Necromaniac\") Atkins, Mark (\"Scare Me\") Borchardt, David (\"Catharsis\") Stagnari, John (\"Dark Night of the Soul\") Brodie, animator John (\"Chirpy\") Goras and SFX makeup artist Tate (\"Zombie Honeymoon\") Steinsiek and the results are hilarious, encouraging and depressing. Garetano also interviewed such horror veterans as Herschell Gordon Lewis, whose advice to filmmakers is to make a movie FOR the audience, NOT for yourself and \"The Devil's Rejects\" Sid Haig who gives his opinion on when a horror movie goes too far. Cult movie critic Joe Bob Briggs offers his three rules of film-making which are hilarious, Troma king Lloyd Kaufman stops by and \"Fangoria\" editor Tony Timpone gives his insight on the state of horror today versus when he first started at \"Fangoria\". The film is not your typical documentary, filled with \"talking heads\". Garetano follows his subjects as they drive around their respective cities: Milwaukee in Borchardt's case and Las Vegas with Atkins. He visits in their homes, goes on-set, behind-the-scenes, meets family members. But the bottom line with everyone he speaks with is the drive and the passion it takes to make it even a little bit in the cutthroat film industry. He interviews some very young film fans and asks them what they want to be when they grow up and, naturally, they all want to make movies. He even opens his film with every young filmmaker's first experience � making a horror movie with their siblings or friends in their backyard with dad's movie camera. But then it's back to the reality � he talks with Canadian Brian Singleton who has had to return from Florida to live with his parents and try to continue his dream with no money. Mark Borchardt's mom is helping him finance his film. Some of the films being made are amateurish, others a bit more polished but at the heart of \"Horror Business\" is the degree of passion these artists feel about what they are doing. Some of the filmmakers are egotistical to a laugh-out-loud degree while others are quiet and more grounded and realistic about the business they have chosen to be in. One thing they all seem to have in common though, is a love for such classic horror films as \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" and \"The Last House on the Left\", both films being mentioned by all of the filmmakers as having a huge impact on them when they were young. These filmmakers aren't poseurs or auteurs � they are regular guys who loved being scared as kids and want to scare moviegoers today. There are some brief discussions about why we enjoy being scared, how horror movies are a catharsis from the horrors of everyday life, how they show us our own mortality but basically Garetano has made a thoroughly entertaining film that takes us inside the minds of five disparate horror filmmakers and shows us what they go through to make their and our dreams (or nightmares) come true. By Elaine Lamkin",
         "It's about two percent movie making and ninety-eight percent hustling. It's no way to spend a life.\" Orson Welles Every review of this film will probably state this quote. Which is OK, because the film opens with it. But it's the perfect summary as director Christopher Garetano explores and investigates why we're drawn, filmmakers especially, to horror in general. It's also an examination of the spirit one tries to hold onto in a harsh business to enter, let alone prosper in. So you wanna make movies? Why? And if so, why horror? What is it that makes us come back again and again to the genre? What would drive you to put \"regular life\" on hold indefinitely to create these twisted visions? Director Garetano- creator of the horror magazine Are you Going? (which he put on hiatus to make this film) and the award-winning experimental short INSIDE- decides to avoid horror's usual suspects (Stephen King, George Romero, Wes Craven etc.) and focus that question on the little guy, five or six independent up-and-comers with varying degrees of ambition and ability. We meet such distinct iconoclasts as lone wolf David Stagnari, who spends years honing a surrealistic black-and-white nightmare called Catharsis, and wondering if there's even a place for his work in the era of glossy, soulless, empty films..Button-pusher Ron Atkins, who cranks out over-the-top tales of decadence and madness; John Brodie, a David Icke conspiracy theorist/producer who helps Ron complete a video dramatizing the alien takeover of the American Government; and John Goras, a mild-mannered animator who gets his angst out through titles like Son of God vs. Son of Godzilla. We also spend some time on the set of Zombie Honeymoon, where director Dave Gebroe aims for a more dramatic, character-based conflict amidst the body parts, courtesy of FX master Tate Steinsiek. And with Brian Singleton, who works on his own documentary of the paranormal and his own sci-fi/horror hybrid flicks with no money, time, or apartment to his credit� We also visit on set with Mark Borchardt, who indie and documentary fans will remember from 1999's American Movie. This film, however, is not a sequel; we only deal with Mark as he relates to the theme of the piece. As engaging as always, Mark actually seems to have lost his drive after this previous film Coven in the late 90's and we get to watch him regain it with his first feature Scare Me. An excitingly visual documentary, Garetano avoids static, talking heads for the most part and peppers his film with colorful visual montages, often dramatizing the spirit of film-making a la Errol Morris; the film opens with a little kid in his bathroom applying KISS-like horror makeup and joining another kid brandishing a movie camera, recreating Night of the Living Dead on a child's level; it perfectly sets the playful tone and will make a lot of struggling indies grin and think back to their formative years. It's never distractingly stylized except for some occasional interviews, which are captured at jarring angles that make you crane your head. Editing is tight and the timing makes some funny moments even funnier; There's some laugh out loud scenes as we follow these persistent dreamers through their highs and lows, and every personality he follows is at the least, interesting; with egos ranging from swollen to nonexistent. Yet the material never becomes condescending or a point-and-laugh affair, nor a 'Project Greenlight' chronicle of on-set mishaps and doubts. These folks, like all aspiring artists and craftsmen, were touched by films in their youth and will stop at nothing to be able to touch them back. The fact that the films that set them off were full of monsters, gore, madness and suspense is irrelevant. It's an honest yet hopeful look at the no-budget end of genre film-making. The doc briefly turns to some low budget genre pioneers and well-known horror celebs. H.G. Lewis ('The Godfather of Gore') discusses entertainment vs. indulgence, Sid Haig(The Devil's Rejects, Spider Baby) talks commitment and \"how much is too much,\" Tony Timpone(head of Fangoria magazine) shares his views on the genre's viability, and Joe Bob Briggs nails it when he discusses what usually sucks about low or no-budget films(stop casting your non-actor friends!). Some of the work we see from the directors is barely above the amateur level, some more ambitious and detailed; but their resulting work isn't the point. (though there's a great ending sequence where a lot of them accomplish their immediate goals) Against all odds, they are out there shooting, getting it done, (hopefully) learning more about their craft etc. How many filmmakers start out that way and end up just talking?",
         "Writing for Rogue Cinema has been a bit of an eye opener for me. I have to admit that, in the past, I've always watched movies and either enjoyed them, or didn't, without much thought to what went into the making of the movie itself. Well, in the past year or two, I've had my eyes opened as to the time and effort it takes to make even the smallest of movies and there's a movie out now that will help everyone to understand the independent film maker and what it takes to make a movie on your own, it's called Horror Business. Horror Business is a documentary that follows three filmmakers as they make their latest projects. The first Mark Borchardt is filming a movie called Scare Me, a horror story about an author battling evil. Horror Business follows Mark as he gets started writing and filming the movie and it's a great glimpse into the world of independent film, as Mark tells his mother that because she's given him money, she's a defacto executive producer on his film, and the behind the scenes footage of the filming is informative too, when the person who was supposed to run the camera doesn't show up, Mark calls on an extra who's run a camera before to do the filming for the night, explaining that the more experience you have in the film industry the more likely it is that you'll get to work if you find yourself on a movie set, which seems to be true! Next is Ron Atkins, a Las Vegas filmmaker who's filming his latest movie, Sins Of Government, a story that revolves around our government really being run by alien reptiles that have taken human form. Ron is a complete commando filmmaker, taking adversity in stride. His philosophy seems to be, just keep filming! Last, but not least, is David Stagnari, a New York film maker, who's film Catharsis seems to be the most 'artsy' of the lot, if that's indeed a word. The word of the day in all of the productions seen in Horror Business is 'work'. As an average moviegoer, you really don't get an idea of what goes into the making even a low budget movie. There are no dressing rooms, there are no divas, there's just a lot of people with a common vision who are working hard to get that vision on film, working twelve hours a day or more with little or no pay, these movies are truly labors of love and you really get to see that in Horror Business. If you've ever wondered about a person who would spend his time and hard earned money just to make a movie, or if you're one of those people whose currently saving their money with a vision in mind, Horror Business is for you. Chris Garetano's movie is a truly honest look at the independent film making process and the people behind and in front of the cameras. After seeing this, you'll never watch another low budget movie in the same way again, and that's a good thing. Horror Business is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen and whether you love horror movies or just movies in general, this will give you an idea of how much work can go into a movie and the love that film makers feel for their projects. It's called Horror Business and it's worth the time and effort you'll spend in finding it! Head on over to Horror Business Movie.com to get it today! And so, until next time when I'll tell you about my documentary, I'm going behind the scenes of a bakery, not because I think it'll be a good movie, just because I like the donuts, remember that the best movies are bad movies.

         "Horror Business review by Wes Vance of DEADPIT.COM (DEAD PIT RADIO) While I'm a huge fan of the horror genre and of cinema in general, its been quite a long time since I've been truly captivated by a film. Some examples (not all horror related but nevertheless) are The Shawshank Redemption, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Carrie, Stand By Me, Friday the 13th , The Evil Dead, Halloween, Psycho, Dawn of the Dead..the list goes on and on but as you can tell none are younger than 12. But auspiciously enough I've found a brand new film that captivates me, and holds my interest all of its 82-minute run time. This film is from Christopher P. Garetano who documented 'Horror Business' over the span of 3 years. I'm a big supporter of documentaries and the rare chance to have a horror-based documentary just pleased the hell out of me. Garetano interviews and follows the progress of many independent filmmakers including: Mark Borchardt (from another great documentary in 'American Movie'), Ron Atkins and Dave Stagnari who seems to feel EXACTLY the same about the horror industry as The Creepy Kentuckian & Uncle Bill! Also the documentary has special appearances from Sid Haig, Joe Bob Briggs and a rarely out of character Lloyd Kaufman. The thing I loved most about the film is just getting in the mind of these independent filmmakers, discovering what motivates them to continue to make films and what they think of the mainstream horror films. If you're an independent filmmaker, a horror fan, or a third party this is a must see film!",
         "Written by Ilise S. Carter of NEWYORKCOOL.COM Not for the Faint of Heart! Horror has long been the unwanted mutant under the stairs of the film industry and, despite the occasional break out hit, has remained a largely marginalized genre since Nosferatu flickered across silent screens. As a result, horror films have long had a reputation for being cheap, low class and accessible to everyone with a home movie camera, a twisted dream and some prop blood � and oddly enough this is mostly true. Perhaps more than other type of film-making, horror is truly directed its fan's appetites. This fan phenomenon is lovingly documented in Christopher P. Garetano's Horror Business with interviews ranging from horror legends to homegrown visionaries and every sort of fan in between. Shot with hand-held cameras in the collectors' conventions, the backyard sets and the living rooms where fans and filmmakers gather, the film gives its subjects ample room to explain their personal connections to the world of violence, the occult and fantasy that make up the oeuvre. This mix of objectivity and affection are what makes Horror Business so much fun. Whether it's drive-in film critic, Joe Bob Briggs, explaining the three pitfalls of amateur filmmakers (i.e., too many zombies, don't cast your friends, and lesbian vampires); or Long Island filmmaker \"Slave\" lamenting the current vapid state of pop culture; or designer Andy Gore showing off his line of serial killer pillows, you can't help but share in their enthusiasm � even if you do feel a little cooler.",

He's also made several film shorts -- one of which (INSIDE) was featured in the 2004 Fangoria Blood Drive series. Chris' latest project though may well be his crowning achievement. It's a fascinating documentary called HORROR BUSINESS. The movie covers the careers of five up-and-coming horror-movie loving directors � Mark Borchardt ('Coven'), Ron Atkins ('Necromaniac'), Dave Stagnari ('Catharsis'), John Gora ('Chirpy'), and Brian Singleton. It's a fascinating look behind the filmmakers and what drives them (and us) in this ongoing, crazy, and unshakable love of the genre. Watching this documentary it's also clear that the man at the helm of the HORROR BUSINESS has an equally deep and compelling love of horror.",
         "Saw this at a festival last year, looking forward to its DVD release in '07. It's all about the struggle, really, and if you're an in-the-trenches, do it yourself indie filmmaker you'll absolutely appreciate it. But it's worth checking out even if you are NOT making films. The struggle to push through the odds and reach a goal is one every viewer can relate to, and the group of artists focused on is always entertaining to watch. The director focuses on several people in various stages of production in their low or lower-budgeted horror films, and speaks to some key industry folk(Tony Timpone from Fangoria, Sid Haig, Joe Bob Briggs, HG Lewis and others) for perspective. What's cool about this documentary is it has its own distinct personality, it tells its story clearly but with its own visual flourish that most docs don't even attempt. It's got a central vision and a warm heart that shines through it, it never goes off on tangents. I was into it from the great opening sequence where a young boy puts on his monster makeup and joins his friends in making their first creature epic in the backyard, with their little film cameras. American Movie fans will get to check out what Mark Borchardt has been up to since \"Coven\", and you'll see up and coming directors like Dave Gebroe sweat through a grueling day of shooting on \"Zombie Honeymoon\"(which turned out great). Very inspiring and worth checking out, looking forward to part II.",
         "Horror Business (2005) Director -Christopher P. Garetano Review by \" Nightmare Child\" Originally posted on Horror-Fanatics.com Our journey begins with a dream. Film makers are dreamers, and always will be. These are the first set of words that are uttered in Christopher Garetano's documentary Horror Business. As fans of the horror genre we often share the same dream. To be apart of that experience whether it's behind or in front of the camera. These movies had a strong affect on us as children and we grew up with it. We love it, we live it and we will do anything in our power to keep the genre alive. This documentary is a bold and daring look at the working world of low budget independent cinema. What drives a person to make their own movie? If you're interested in film making and the criticism behind a blood soaked genre, then Horror Business is a must watch for you. This documentary is gives in depth look at guerilla film-making. Featuring interviews with movie makers who dedicate their lives to entertaining themselves, and others. I am pleased to say that Horror Business is a must see. I've watched this documentary about 5 times prior to writing this review. Not all at once, but it just took me so long to come up with an idea for the review. Horror Business covers just about everything horror related. Everything from entertainment, marketing and actual down and dirty movie making. The documentary features interviews with many different film makers along with actors and other movie crew. While some of the credited cast are well known individuals, the rest run under the radar. Each person interviewed in Horror business share same love. We follow these independent directors as they explain why they make these pictures and why they continue working to do so. It wasn't apparent to me from the beginning but the more I watched Horror Business the more I began to realize why the poster says \"movie making is NO WAY to spend a life\". Some of the film makers shown in this documentary make these movies not just because they love doing it, but because they're stuck. They've invested so much time and money over the years that they just can't stop and take their life into another direction. This aspect of the film appealed to me most and I'm willing to bet that it's the key point to this documentary. The main drive isn't clear right away though. There are so many topics of discussion that you'll be left questioning what the reason behind this documentary is. I liked Horror Business a lot, I thought that it was a very well made picture. It took me a few tries to understand the point but I think I finally got it. The interviews are great, the music is good and the editing is fantastic. I love the horror genre very much and watching Horror Business was a huge realization as to why I'm so attached to it. It's like looking at yourself in the mirror and remembering the finer points of your childhood. Horror Business is the perfect title for this wonderful work of art. In this documentary Tony Timpone (editor of Fangoria magazine) mentioned that horror films are like therapy sessions. When you think about it, it's very true. I've heard this before from close friends of mine and I just so happen to agree one hundred percent. These movies bring something out of us that no other genre of film ever could. Fear can be fun, to be scared is like a going through a roller coaster. You get scared, but when it's all over you have a good laugh and want to go on again. Horror movies are just that like, they're fun to watch as long as they don't cross the line. I mentioned early on in this review that Horror Business pretty much covers everything that there is to know about the genre. One of the key discussions was about how far a movie could go. Are horror films dangerous? Can they go too far? These are just some of the many interesting questions that are presented in this documentary. Horror Business is a real in depth look at the reality of movie making. With all that said it's safe to say that this documentary should go into every horror collection. If you're into the idea of film making, acting or if you just love the genre, then Horror Business is a must see for you.",
         "Indeed, this is a good movie. In fact, it's downright refreshing. The decision by filmmaker Christopher P Garetano to focus his film on the new breed of horror movie makers was truly an inspired one. And by \"new breed\" I don't mean the likes of Eli Roth, Rob Zombie or Alexandre Aja. I'm talking about guys like Ron Atkins, David Stagnari and Mark Borchardt. Who? Exactly, these are the grassroots filmmakers, the guys the general movie-going faithful don't even know � save for maybe Borchardt who was the subject of the 1999 film 'American Movie'. Director Garetano skillfully inter-cuts lively moments of a handful of these \"new breed\" filmmakers struggling to get their flicks made with clips and sound-bites from classic films of a sadly bygone era. Seeing newspaper one-sheets and hearing radio spots for old films like 'Torso', 'Last House On The Left' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' brought a nice nostalgic touch to the film, and it's hard not to want to pick-up a handy-cam and join these fellas in their plight to make the next low budget masterpiece. Most of the guys spotlighted in this doc come across as likable, everyday kids who just want to make something different � something anti-establishment, anti-Hollywood�maybe even something a little bit dangerous; kudos to them all! The doc is also peppered with small interview clips from the likes of Sid Haig, Joe Bob Briggs and the master of no-budget spat-fests himself, Mr. Hershell Gordon Lewis who all give their take on what it takes to make it in the world of horror cinema. The general consensus seems to be this: entertain people. Hallelujah!",
         "Horror Business Review by George A. Romero (director of Night Of The Living Dead, Dawn Of The Dead, Creepshow, and Day Of The Dead) \" Horror Business is a terrific flick. Christopher Garetano has completely succeeded in describing the passions, the adventures- and the misadventures- of crazy people like me who, somewhere along the way, decided they... needed to make movies. Anyone who wants to write or direct should see this film. Those who have never dreamed of being filmmakers should see it for its humor and its pure entertainment value. Two thumbs up- both of them mine because, like the others Garetano has portraited, I basically work alone.\" -George A. Romero"
