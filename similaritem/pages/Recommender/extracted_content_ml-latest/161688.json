What I really liked about the film are the dialogues. It is kind of artsy, surely not easily accessible but if you give the movie space to develop you get drawn into it and let go of other things on your mind. It is a rather slow movie, sometimes maybe even a bit too slow but the general tempo beautifully mixes with the wise choice of music and sound or even silence. If you see the plot in general, it is surely not the strong part of \"Berserker\" but I got the impression that the plot is not to be put in the foreground too much. One thing I do have to criticize is the scene with the head in the car right at the beginning that looked kind of cheap and didn't really connect to the sober and clear images the film generally provides. For me that scene could be easily left to the imagination of the audience. All in all I was positively surprised by this movie. It is not a game changer or something but it does some things different and that not for the worse."],
