         "Disorder is a one man protection mission slash home invasion film. This has been done many times before and this is definitely not the best and is probably not the worst either. As a whole the acting was good. Matthias Schoenaerts was pretty good in this film and literally gives my rating 2 of its 4 stars. Plus the dedication to the role he gave was impressive literally sacrificing his own health for the film has to earn some respect in my books. The other 2 of my 4/10 rating come from the musical soundtrack. The sound is reminiscent of the horror film It Follows which I loved. The soundtrack is perfect at creating tension and was the real front running micro element to create the films suspense. If all else its also just nice to listen to. Now my problems with the film... First of all the film confused me, as in I wasn't sure what it wanted to be. There is a large section of the film near the end that aims for a horror kind of feel which the films climax at night. But when it actually came to the pay off it was underwhelming. No music, no tension, rather weak as the film has literally been 1 hour and a half build up. Another thing was the pacing. I know this films aim was to build tension, but this film felt painfully long. I think this was down to the lack of action in general. Not just violent fighting action, but just literally anything of interest happening. I felt so bored at times I just wanted to smash my face against a glass table multiple times (#references). This film felt rather repetitive, and to me, that really took away from some of the tension. If you use the same techniques over and over to create tension in s film that feels longer than it is, then it may get old pretty quick. The film consisted of and relied on its soundtrack, walking shots, walking shots at night, slo mo for ptsd struggling and silence. There is so much walking in this film, and if you do it at night with a suspenseful soundtrack its bound to build tension. Sadly to me, that formula felt a tad too easy and basic to create the tension and thus did not impress me. Overall the acting and soundtrack were good but the film was repetitive, painfully slow and overall unsatisfied me. I was not left unsatisfied purely because of the ambiguousness of its ending, but because the film builds and builds and builds to its ending, to which the pay off was literally non existent.",
         "I was not sure what to expect with this. But I was definitely intrigued with the two leads, Matthias Schnoenarts and Diane Kruger. I like a lot of the films that they star in. So it will be interesting to see what their chemistry is on screen. The premise was definitely one I do not see that often. Also, the story that director and writer Alice Winocaur had put onto screen got me invested. But despite me still finding it reasonably enjoyable, I felt that we have a missed opportunity here. One thing is for sure, Schoenaerts was great as our main character. A bit like Tom Hardy, most of his success comes from the physical part of the performance. You can really see the killer instinct in his character and his charisma definitely carries this film well. I was feeling his characters problems and I was rooting for him to overcome them. I think without Schoenarts, this could have been something quite boring. The rest of the cast were not that memorable, even Kruger. For the few action scenes that were on screen, they were really well constructed. You could really feel the hits being taken. The score was fascinating and surprisingly atmospheric. The style felt different, but managed to fit in well with the film. However, there were some moments where I felt the moment to use that score felt unnecessary or badly timed. Like I said before, there are problems with it. While it may feel slow for the most part, you can feel the tension throughout. You do feel that something does not feel right and we get some well executed action scenes. But I think in the end, the lack of drama and thrills may make people impatient as they know this could go down more interesting routes. I don't get a lot of the slow no-dialogue moments that we seem to see with most of European cinema. It's not often that style gets me totally invested. I was not a fan of the camera-work as well. There was a lot of shaky moments that I felt were unnecessary, and it made me struggle to see what was going on. This negative is a bit of nit pick. But I felt there were too many times when they were reminding us of our main characters anxiety problems. That just seemed to signal to me that they have little more to show and just lingered on that particular part. For what looked like an interesting premise, for me it did not manage to make the most of it. But don't worry, it still remains to be a solidly delivered thriller with an amazing lead by Schoenarts. The way they portrayed his characters problems on screen was quite clever. I also liked it did not have that cliché feeling at all, and that might be the reason that I remained interested. Despite its problems, I will still recommend this. Winocour should be proud of this. I will definitely check out the rest of her work. Rating: 7/10",
         "This is not your usual \"home invasion\" film.It's above all an incredible sensory experience.Alice Winocur (who directed 2 years ago the magnificent \"Augustine\") creates a great combo between drama & paranoid thriller.And don't expect a love story ala Bodyguard. Matthias Schoenaerts is phenomenal as usual.It's quite an intense performance.You're truly seeing things through the eyes of his emotionally damaged character. Diane Kruger is also solid but the movie truly belongs to King Matthias.The ending could have been slightly better but it doesn't take anything away from the quality of the film. The soundtrack is also very catchy : Gaffelstein is a genius ! He creates a very atmospheric environment. A must see !",
         "Disorder (2015) Alice Winocour's thriller set in upper class France is filled with anxiety, and is filmed very smartly to increase that stress without resorting to pyrotechnics. Quietly, especially because of the edgy psychological performance by Matthias Schoenaerts, we feel the anxiety of an ex-soldier fighting PTSD and still doing private high brow security work. The setting is interesting but the plot is thin. This can work for the film, which depends on lots of quiet moments to punch up the drama when it occurs. The direction is really good, with some simple strategies at play. Example\u2014when our main character, who is guarding someone off in the distance, is sensing danger, his eyes flit around, he stiffens up and walks and look, but the one thing the camera doesn't do is show us the person he's protecting. In the dark, we worry, and we don't know if the danger is real or if he's just too high strung. Seeing the inside of a high level security detail is nice, and it's handled with good realism. The whole movie, in fact, depends on a simple believability that typical Hollywood versions would ramp up, and it works. The big downside here is the writing. There isn't enough to the overall plot after all (and Schoenaerts can't do everything). And some of the dialog is unlikely or a big out off kilter. Sucked into the mis-en-scene, you can go with it, at least until the long stretch at the end in the house, when you do wish it hadn't trapped itself into a series of well worn ideas. The last several seconds of the movie do show that the director/writer is capable of more than you'll find here. It might be unexplained, but it leaves at least still immersed as you leave the film's finely rendered world.",
         "Trapped in a perpetual war zone and PTSD-fueled paranoia?? These are two catch phrases I found on the back cover as part of the movie's synopsis. I didn't find this to be true. I found him to be much more vigilant than he needed to be, but then if he hadn't been, the end to this movie would have been far different. Vincent is doing odd jobs while he waits to see if the Army is going to allow him to return to the war in Afghanistan. As a viewer I got the sense that everyone but Vincent knew he wasn't going back. He is given a security job at a party of a Lebanese businessman. When he has to leave on a business trip, Vincent is hired as a bodyguard to the man's wife, Jessie and their young son. The husband is arrested, though Im not sure why, and the film spends little time \"discussing\" this. There is a trip to the beach where, on the way back, Vincent suspect they are being followed. He drives recklessly to get away and Jessie demands that she be allowed to drive. An attempt to kidnap Jessie or the son takes place and Vincent saves them. This is where the movie loses direction for me. It's obvious that something is really wrong with this Lebanese man, but Vincent suspects that Jessie may know things she isn't telling, but again the film doesn't reveal much. There is never a full-blown romance between Vincent and Jessie, but it is clear that he has feelings for her. The film kind of dances around; leading me into one direction after another and then abandons. What's going on with the husband, what is the local police's involvement, does Jessie know what's going on, what's with the all the papers laying around...does Jessie really come back to Vincent at the end of the movie. If she doesn't and that is all in his mind, then for me, the movie did a bad job in showing just how ill Vincent is. And if she does, then it did a bad job of showing how much Jessie felt for Vincent. Either way there's a big hole in the middle of this film!!!",
         "In a twist on the story of a combat veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder attempting to adjust to civilian life, director Alice Winocour realigns the balance of the narrative to focus as much on romance and one woman's perspective as action and a psychologically wounded man. Vincent takes odd jobs as he lobbies to return to combat as a soldier. Despite its inherent dangers, combat at least is a place where he has a mission and purpose. Civilian life is not so kind. It is confusing, degrading and offers little in the way of sympathy for what Vincent has been through. A side job as part of a security team, together with his military pals, takes Vincent to a mansion, party and pretty woman who attracts his eyes and focus. In the ensuing days Vincent is drawn into a personal security detail for her. When she is targeted for kidnapping, the pair must draw upon not just Vincent's military training, but upon their basic qualities as human beings. Because each of them has moved in different spheres until then, this may not work so well. The sound selections and wounded hero narrative are reminiscent of the Nicolas Winding Refn films that I love. However, Winocour cannot quite match Refn's levels of tension, chemistry and spectacle. I admire the acting of Matthias Schoenaerts and he does not disappoint here. While the film has some potential to live up to, there is ample suspense and intrigue inside the characters and the scenes that envelop them. Seen at the 2016 Miami International Film Festival.",
         "Disorder AKA Maryland is a bit of a mystery about a bodyguard with post traumatic stress disorder. I expected it to be a bit exciting with the plot summary on IMDb but it moves at a slow pace and is trying to be a bit of a psychological drama- thriller. Which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing but the edge isn't quite there , it never truly gets suspenseful even though the plot technically have moments where it should be. I didn't hate it or anything and the acting is okay but overall I think this is the type of movie that in a year I might have forgotten I've even seen because it plays everything so low-key and well the plot isn't all that intriguing or original. It's in French btw, when I got it I didn't realise that as I'm used to seeing Diane Kruger in American films and well I thought Maryland (which is the original title of the film) was taken from the state of Maryland, USA but there is actually a place called Maryland in France as well and that's where the name is from as it's there it takes place.",
         "This tense roller-coaster of suspense encapsulates the current international corruption in politics. In the pre-title sequence two lines of charging, hooting soldiers converge on a tufted plain. The ensuing narrative will trace the central soldier's disintegration \u2014 an emblem of the disintegration of our global politics. A broken time breaks its defenders \u2014 and requires broken men to save it. Hero Vincent is initially shot in intense close-up, which with the throbbing soundtrack suggests the wounded man's heightened sensitivity. His visit to a crippled veterans' rehab centre provides physical equivalents to his mental damage. There he buys blackmarket drugs, a dangerous alternative to the psychological help he refuses The political backdrop coheres with Vincent's presentation as \u2014 from his tattoo \u2014 a figure of Chaos and the global disorder evoked by the title. The Lebanese mogul is an international arms dealer, himself a figure of chaos and world disorder, feeding the violence which ultimately creeps from the Middle East into his luxurious French estate. The posh party Vincent is hired to guard ripples with sinister disorder, from the belligerent unlisted visitor to the suspicious negotiations in the back rooms and rolling lawns. The ominous scheming undercuts the bucolic atmosphere of the estate's name, Maryland. Vincent's eagerness to return to the war in Afghanistan shows him crippled not just by the violence of war but by his addiction to it. While friend Dennis explains that Vincent's head is still in the battlefield, his anxiety makes him a questionable but excellent \"security guard.\" The term is paradoxical for a man of such violence, paranoia and danger. When he appears to have over- reacted to the car possibly following Vincent and his charges to the seashore, his paranoia is justified by the violent attack upon them later. The arms-dealer's family are a telling extension. Little Ali is the privileged son whose parents refrain from denying anything or discipline. The German Jessie begins as the standard issue blonde trophy wife, but softens when she leaves the party to feed the dog. Though Vincent is initially hired to secure them for the arms dealer's two days away, ultimately the arms-dealer abandons them, as the police will too. They are left to the shaky Vincent to protect. The polished serene Jessie and the damaged Vincent may seem antithetical but ultimately both prove isolated, enclosed in their respective psychological bubbles, unable to make any meaningful connection beyond themselves \u2014 except for the family dog, Ghost, an emblem of commitments now dead. As Vincent grows increasingly enchanted by Jessie, he remains more removed and sombre than his friend Dennis's later play with her. Vincent reads an invitation into her fantasy of him killing bears when she will escape to a friend in Canada. His delusion that they might have a relationship is harshly ended when he sees her look of fear and revulsion at his repeatedly smashing an invader's face into the glass coffee table. The willfully uninformed Jessie is appalled at what her protection requires. Yet the last shot has Jessie returning to embrace Vincent. Whether she actually does that or he imagines her doing it we can't firmly say. The film tacitly allows both readings. If she does it, she has realized her escape to Canada was impossible and she needs this powerful man to provide the security for which she initially married the arms dealer. If she doesn't, then Vincent has taken another pathetic step into madness, bolstering his illegal painkillers with an implausible romantic fantasy. Either reading confirms the antithetical characters' essential similarity as isolates awakened to a brutish disorder. That theme grows out of writer/director Alice Winocour's earlier Mustang. The woman's hand is also evident in the film's concern for how men are weakened by their strength. Her beefcake shots of Matthias Schoenaerts parodies the familiar male fetishizing of the female lead.",
         "Matthias Schoenaerts plays Vincent, a soldier who has returned from Afghanistan and is now suffering Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). He is signed off from duties and so gets to work as a hired security guard. One of his friends gets him a gig working for a wealthy, but decidedly shady, Lebanese businessman. Once there he becomes enamoured with his very attractive wife (Diane Kruger) and ends up being assigned to watch over her as a personal bodyguard. He is still dealing with PTSD and the effects of having served as Special Forces and so is on edge and sees danger where it may not be. However, he soon feels that she and her son are under threat and then \u2013 well it all kicks off but to say anymore would be a plot spoiler. Now the part of Vincent was written with Schoenaerts in mind and he does a very good job indeed (I have PTSD so could spot some of the subtleties) but the tension and atmosphere that is engendered at the beginning then starts to fade as the plot reveals itself. The story is fairly good though and the ending may bemuse some but the overall journey is one that is worth the effort. In French with good sub titles this will appeal to lovers of thrillers but it is not one that is too taxing on the intellect.",
         "Writer/Director Alice Winocour has created one of the finer films of the past year \u2013 a film that unveils the degree of tension and fear and terror of various odd sounds that affects soldiers returning form the various wars in the Middle East: a change that has been labeled Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Working closely with her main character played by the astonishingly fine Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts, Winocour finally puts a face on the 'disorder'. The result is one of the more tense psychological thrillers of the recent past. The story opens with a quiet but moving moment as Vincent Loreau (Matthias Schoenaerts), a French Special Forces soldier just back from Afghanistan, is informed he will not be returning to battle \u2013 he is suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, manifested by his hearing noises in his ears accompanied by nausea and vomiting, among other things. He and his military buddies take on a side job as a security team to provide security for a mansion party. Later, as a favor to his buddy, Vincent is hired to ensure the safety of Jessie (Diane Kruger), the wife of a wealthy Lebanese businessman (Percy Kemp) in his \"Maryland\" property in the South of France. While he feels a strange fascination for the woman he must protect, Vincent is prone to anxiety and hallucinations. Despite the apparent tranquility on \"Maryland\", Vincent perceives an external threat. When Jessie is targeted for kidnapping, the Vincent and Jessie must draw upon not just Vincent's military training, but upon their basic qualities as human beings. Because each of them has moved in different spheres until then, this may not work so well. The first hour of the film is a vivid depiction of the psychological stress and disorder Vincent endures, but in the last thirty minutes the tension is almost unbearable as Vincent physically protects Jessie and her son from potential kidnappers. The manner in which Schoenaerts plays this difficult role is brilliant and together with Kruger they offer some of the most realistic acting on the screen today. This is very finely written and acted psychological thriller. Highly Recommended. In French with English subtitles.",
         "I was very surprised at this movie. The IMDb precis led me to think it was going to be an average action thriller so I watched it to fill in a dull couple of hours, but what a treat it turned out to be. Definitely not for the Hollywood action fan, this movie is an incredibly well-paced (read: slow burn) psychological study and suspense builder. I found a lot of it reminiscent of a great Hitchcock, who was, after all, the master of building true suspense out of the ominously suggested but mainly unseen. Matthias Schoenaerts is absolutely brilliant. His portrayal of a damaged, sometimes paranoid, drug-dependent, PTSD-suffering soldier trying to carry out a fill-in assignment on a private security detail is a masterpiece of characterisation. The directing is superb and had me watching in delight throughout the film's entirety. The whole recipe is topped off by cinematography that is so ideally matched to the mood(s) of the film, perfectly complimenting the atmospheric, slow-building story. No, we don't get to know the whole of Vincent's character during this movie, but when have you ever got to know someone well after spending a mere two hours with them? We learn what we need to to engage in the movie and that is just the right amount. Some reviewers will bemoan the lack of a full background story, dearth of explosions and other typically Hollywood special effects, the dark settings and minimal dialogue. In my opinion that only illustrates that they entirely miss the point and magic of this beautifully made film and I suggest they go and rent a brash, loud, brain-dead, exaggerated Hollywood action explosion-fest.",
         "I think I was expecting more of an action thriller, but this movie was turned down to three. A guy name Vincent is hired to protect a woman and her son from bad guys looking harm her. Some action does happen in the movie, but it was very quiet and uneventful. A bit of a a shame cause I wanted to like the movie. It was very inventive in its scale. I think the real problem is that I'm not getting any personality from the main characters. I went to go see because Matthias Schoenaerts was the main character. I liked this guy in other movies, but he seemed dull heading up his own flick. I wanted to see the laid out plan work out, but I was not getting enough energy. http://cinemagardens.com",
         "French cinema has come a long way and is close to overtaking Asian cinema as my favourite world cinema. This has all the right ingredients for the type of thriller I personally enjoy the most. Suspense? Plenty. Intense? Sure. Psychologically stimulating? Ehhh. This was an intriguing concoction to mix PTSD psychology with a home invasion flick. It's just a shame the former wasn't explored to its maximum potential. Don't get me wrong, the utilisation of hallucinogenic imagery and delusional paranoia is well executed. In fact, it's what powers the narrative. The story itself is completely forgettable, bland and undeveloped. However, the attention to our protagonist is what truly captivates. Matthias Schoenaerts was the perfect casting choice for Vincent. His brute physicality and cold exterior unleashes plenty of inner torment for the character. You can tell through Schoenaerts' facial expressions that our character is brimming with determination and conflict. A superbly strong performance. Diane Kruger was also good and definitely held her own. The cinematography was incredibly seductive. The usage of slow motion, dark shadows and shades of purple really enhanced the experience. The contemporary sound design also highlighted the scenes of PTSD, which I appreciate. Alice Winocour's direction felt fresh, in particular the \"over-the-shoulder\" camera shots where we see what Vincent might (or might not...) be seeing. Including such intimacy really draws you into the narrative, especially the dialogue is minimal. It's a piece of visual storytelling, which in turn makes the plot less intricate and ambiguous. Whilst it does not necessarily work constantly, I was entranced by this and really enjoyed it. Some more attention to the story would've made it that much better, but it's worth a watch.",
         "A worthy watch for me mainly because of the attractive lead players. A confused screenplay mostly likely added to the suspense. The lead actor as Vincent is just more vicious than Seagal in the action scenes and for better to look at. I had seen the female lead before, and she is not only a pleasure to look at but a competent actor. I thought about the last scene in which a woman comes in to wrap her arms around Vincent. It convinced me that everything that happened to him before, essentially the movie itself was a fantasy.",
         "First let me explain. I did not mean that female directors usually bring bad stuff, no. See for instance Kathryn Bigeow concerning action and testosterone films...No, but this movie, even involving a very beautiful woman - Diane Kruger - remains rather brutal and very realistic. I say that movie avoids many clichés, especially if you consider the end. For the rest, every one expects the usual ending. But that's here you're totally wrong. Maybe the directing involving the camera movements was not quite good, as the other comment said, but I don't care. I love those two characters, as this ex soldier suffering of post war traumatic disorder. And this cold woman who slowly get interested by this man. But is she really? I recommend it.",
         "Disorder is an interesting French thriller about an Afghanistan veteran who takes a job to protect the wife and son of a wealthy Lebanese businessman while at the same time is suffering from PTSD. This is quite slow paced , as you might expect being French but it's well worth watching. Matthias Schoenaerts is excellent as Vincent , the troubled security officer as is Diane Kruger who plays the wife. What little action there is , is done very well and at times it's very tense , Almost like a horror film. There are lots of questions to be asked about what is happening because not all you see may as clear as it seems. When this was released last year it was called Maryland but for the DVD release and the UK/US market they have called is Disorder .",
         "This is a foreign action film that although it has a couple of very decent lead actors (two true favorites).. it really goes nowhere because like so many similar American films, it has little meat to the actual story, and nowhere near any the amount of action sequences necessary to fill the void. And the English sub-titled version is an absolute joke. Not knowing how to speak the language, would not be a disadvantage, as you could be guessing at most all of the dialogue, and still do a substantially better job than the captions shown with this screen version. So how we complain in this country about how European films are invariably always sooo much better.. well here with this production, the opposite is confirmed.",
         "I like Diane Kruger, so watched this. It was awful, there is almost no redeeming value here, it is like watching grass grow. There is almost no action, and even the little that there is makes absolutely no sense. The plot and writing seems like it was by some 9 yr old. Complete waste of time.",
         "I found the movie a mixture of \"Man on fire\" and \"Harsh Times\" plus a bit of \"Jacob's Ladder\" For sure is worth watching if you enjoyed the titles named above. And the acting of Matthias Schoenaerts is good, giving his character the right doses of violence, kindness and madness you would expect in somebody suffering from war related psychical injuries. You find also in the movie quite a realistic depiction of how close protection work is getting done in Europe, from the way they operate to the way the recruiting is done. I have watched Matthias Schoenaerts playing as well in \"The Drop\", he did a good part but the role was small and didn't give him to much of a chance. He has a disposition for bringing to life characters filed with repressed rage and expect to see him mostly in R rated movies and maybe some movies with religious themes. Enjoy it",
         "Main actor is all the money as a saying goes. His portrayal of a war veteran who tries to make a living, but even more tries to live kind of normal (if the bodyguard job can be described as normal), is amazing to watch. It's not fireworks all the time, though it does have some decent stunts and action scenes. But this is more about dealing with you past, the ghosts of things that you have seen and heard. Also falling in love with probably the wrong person. But then again, how does it manifest, if someone with war issues loves someone? And can he be loved back? Especially by someone who already has someone in their life? Will you get all the answers to your questions? The last one I can answer with a no. I do think though that the end is pretty clear, even if some may disagree ...",
         "This is a film with few dialogue. It was the soundtrack and the actors who must speak for themselves. But more could be done with this film and these actors. The genre is not quite clear: a character study of post-traumatic stress disorder? an thriller? an critical society film? Of course Matthias is superb, but I hope to see him also smiling. But the situation here is not for smiling. And why, fgs, must the title be changed from Maryland to Disorder? This English title don't explain anything more than the original title. Perhaps the better should be 'Matthias' (or Vincent) when it is all about a character study of the mean actor Matthias....",
         "Vincent, our hero?, is assigned the task of watching over Jessie and her little boy ali, in an estate home. Jessie's husband may be involved in shady dealings of some kind. it looks that way. he has left Jessie and ali behind, to be watched over by Vincent. Vincent, is in the army, but not on active duty at this time. I think he is suffering from ptsd, but that is not mentioned. he does seem to be on non prescribed drugs, which he gets from a friend working at a hospital. Vincent hears things, or not, is paranoid or not. it's not really defined. things happen. no surprises, really, but nothing is predictable. I was very nervous during this whole movie experience. almost on the edge of my seat. it's very well done and quite effective. you've seen it all before, of course, but when it works, it works. this is a very good film. go."
