         "Five friends have always dreamed of living together and then the perfect apartment comes up and they just have to have it. One of their number \u2013 Samule (Pierre Niney) has a wealthy father who is bank rolling him rather well. So the short fall of his friends he says he is happy to make up. Now all is going fine until his funds dry up and he is desperate for a way of staving off the inevitable. So he does what any self respecting student would do and he becomes a dealer in weed \u2013 nice. But once you dip your little toe in the murky pond of the underworld it is only a matter of time before you become tainted by all its foul corruption \u2013 and I am glad to say hilarity ensues \u2013 sort of. Now this is a comedy but there are some serious issues being dealt with here as well as the inevitable relationship issues and so it is not crammed full with laughs but it is still fairly amusing and it is very likable as the characters are all generally very real and nice in a good way. So if you want a bit of Gallic fun then this might work for you.",
         "'Five' is a fun french movie. These 5 best friends who want to live together encounter many issues. To fix it they are laying together and playing with drugs. They make their problems worse during all the movie. But many comic scenes alternates with more tragic scenes. Each characters are very different but complementary. Actors are well playing and roles are well dispatched. I found some nice shoots (first person) and smart transition. Music is dynamics with lively beats. It is not the movie of the year but it is fun because without limit. I advice to parents to do not show the movie to their children because it contains nude scenes and drug apology."
