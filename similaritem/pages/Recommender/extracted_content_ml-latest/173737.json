What you get is one of the most realistic and dark crime dramas. Everything that happens makes Viktor feel worse and worse. Being framed and hunted he should kill them all before he becomes a broken or a dead man. And he manages it, using all his fighting skills. It's more like a documentary. We, who lived in the late 1980s and early 1990s here, remember these times vividly. It was a survival horror/comedy show. \"Poidiem gromit kavkazskuyu kukhnyu\" was one of our favourite one-liners at school. Igor Talkov makes a tough appearance as the gang leader. His death scene is a prophetic one, which adds to the realism of the film and makes it even darker. Here you are being given a chance to have a look at those cannibalistic times, which lasted only a few years in Russia. But these years left a big scar. A 10 out of 10, with deep respect to everybody engaged in the production. An honest movie about a very peculiar time in our history. Thank you for attention."],
