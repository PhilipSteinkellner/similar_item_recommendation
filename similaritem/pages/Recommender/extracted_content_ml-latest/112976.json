         "I thought this movie was great. Im pretty critical when it comes to movies.. I don't like the usual garbage. Didn't know what to expect when I popped it in. After watching the first 5 mins I thought it was some stupid comedy that was trying too hard. It starts with a lot of Black comics doing short interviews. Kept it on because the direction and the way its made was keeping my attention...not the actual comedy. After a while I realised it wasn't a comedy. Its a serious movie slash documentary with a dorkey comedy element thrown in on top that really makes this movie original. The comedy isn't supposed to make you laugh out loud but comedy that will make you chuckle a bit. We are following the life a comic and the hurdles he faces in life so making the audience laugh too much will take away from the drama/ seriousness of the movie. Everything blended together really well. A couple scenes may leave you with a question mark but you'll get over it if you have an open mind. Acting was great all around, the direction and other work put into this movie was done very well. Great stuff! This movie is inspirational to me and Im glad I got to watch it.",
         "This movie is getting horrible reviews, I don't understand why. It's a mockumentary, they bring in a lot of famous black comics to participate. It's not like they spent millions to make this movie but the quality isn't completely atrocious, it's actually decent. Everything about the movie is cool until they try to make it a serious love/drug addiction sad story; which is why I'm only giving it a 6 since I watched this movie to laugh my ass off, not to see people cry and go through interventions. Besides that, I thought the movie was funny as hell, my favorite character is F.U. and I wished we had seen more of him.",
         "This was actually quite good. I didn't expect too much before tuning in. Tony Rock plays a comedian who had made it big, but had lost it all because of his addiction. The movie is filmed as a documentary of a washed-up comedian making his comeback. The acting is good and the movie contains cameos by a lot of stars. The story is so common is it hard not to believe. It is not a laugh-out-loud comedy, but more of a movie about comics. Though the story itself if pretty predictable, hence the being true-to-life, it is still entertaining. I thought Tony Rock did a great job and all the supporting actors were as good, if not better. I wouldn't say this is an Oscar-worthy movie, but if you are looking for good acting with a good story and you like this genre, the movie is worth your time.",
         "Being a comedian in LA, I didn't have high expectations for this film because there are just so many attempts to create documentaries about comedy/comedians and most get it wrong. Now mind you, I don't know a plethora of comics that are losing everything to dope...but its a common tragedy for the entertainment industry in general so I was game. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I thought the film was very accurate in their portrayal of: the comedic scene, comic relations, social and career expectations and drug addiction. It was also awesome to see friends and people I have respected do so well. A must see...a great mix of FUNNY, DRAMATIC and RELEVANT.",
         "i cannot understand the low ratings on this movie. i wonder if those raters actually watched this movie or did they give up when they realized it is not strictly a comedy. this movie is what i would label a reality/mockumentary/drama! told from a 'reality show' viewpoint it chronicles the decline and fall of a successful comedian. this 'reality show' format is nothing new. but paring it with a mockumentary/drama is pure genius!!! the movie offers something for everyone - good acting - comedy - drama - reality - a faceless voice over explaining what is taking place in some possibly confusing scenes - etc., etc. and it is an art flick!!! i have told friends about this movie and i certainly hope they give it a try."
