         "For forty years, the public functionary and family man Lineu (Marcos Nanini) and his beloved wife Nenê (Marieta Severo) celebrate their first date going to the same ball where Lineu borrowed the jacket his competitor Carlinhos (Paulo Betti). In the present days, Lineu feels uncomfortable when his colleague Pacheco dies and goes to the doctor for health examination. When the result of his tomography arrives, his doctor says that he had seen some blur in his lungs and with that report he would give the correct diagnosis. Lineu steals the document afraid of having a tumor, but he believes he will die sooner. Meanwhile, Nenê meets Carlinhos in the supermarket where he is the manager and invites him to have dinner with her family. Lineu hides his concerns to Nenê, and his attitudes in the dinner misguide Nenê, and she believes Lineu has a lover and does not love him anymore. \"A Grande Família \u0096 O Filme\" is based on a successful Brazilian TV show, but I expected much more of this movie. Unfortunately the story is a weak collection of suburban clichés, with a confused resolution. The story is supposed to be funny, but I confess that a laughed only in a few moments, mostly with Pedro Cardoso's character. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): \"A Grande Família \u0096 O Filme\" (\"The Great Family \u0096 The Movie\")",
         "I should've known that. A Grande Família is a good Brazilian TV show, but doesn't work that good in the screens. The story of this film is basically pretty similar to the show's, but 104 minutes with these few characters makes it boring. The film keeps coming and going, obviously to gain some minutes of length, which tires the spectator-- and made me pray for it to end. Sadly I wasn't able to make it to the end, since I was tired of the same characters acting the same way with no big reasons for you to keep watching. At least the confusions are original and not copied from an old episode, but it's not enough to make this even close to be great."
