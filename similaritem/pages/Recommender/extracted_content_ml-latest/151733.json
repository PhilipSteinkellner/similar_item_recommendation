         "I had high expectations for this film and was not disappointed. It's a compelling and insightful look at the evolution of the comedy scene in South Africa. Trevor Noah is a talented comedian with an intriguing life story and there were poignant moments in the film that took me by surprise. I thought the subtle uses of humor and irony throughout the documentary were brilliant. On the technical side, I enjoyed the dynamic cinematography and exceptional soundtrack. My husband, who isn't always a fan of documentaries, also greatly enjoyed the film. We both thought it was the perfect length as well and it didn't drag on as some documentaries tend to do.",
         "I watched this on Netflix just now. I decided to watch it because it sounded interesting. Well, it certainly delivers! I have a couple of acquaintances in South Africa, so I suppose I'm slightly less ignorant... but the two people I know there are white, so I think that certainly skews the point of view. I found this insightful, funny, touching... just really great. I am ashamed to admit, I didn't remember he was the one to take over the Daily Show until about 10 minutes before this was finished. To explain, I can't afford cable, and only catch clips on YouTube for at least the past 2 years. I hope to be in a better situation soon when I can have cable, because I want to watch him in action!! At any rate, this review is specifically for this documentary, which I think was very well done. Showing many perspectives, personal life... just very well done."
