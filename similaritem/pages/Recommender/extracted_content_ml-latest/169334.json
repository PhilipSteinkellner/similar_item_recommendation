Too bad, because this was a funny show, and Gulman is hysterical in his observations on being lazy, technology, and Millennial disdain for paying for things. But the best was a recap of brilliant minds brought together in the mid-Seventies whose job it was to reduce the names of all the states into a two letter abbreviation. And the way Gulman goes about his routine is kind of unique because he veers off into different territory while on a particular topic. You think he might have finished his earlier thought, but then he comes back on track to finish out the concept he started with. Very clever. Gary finishes up with his personal melt down at Trader Joe's, and for anyone who's ever shopped in a supermarket, the situation will resonate in a way only he can explain."],
