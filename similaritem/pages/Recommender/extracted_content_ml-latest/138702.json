         "I was in the theater and about to watch Big Hero 6 when this came out first. My dog died a week before and it remind me of him. The story was simple yet it has a deep meaning on what's the connection of the master and the dog. First on how strangers become friends. How friend got replaced by a better person. How friendship fix everything; and a sacrifice to make your friend happy even if its painful in your side. Though there was a sad tear jerking scenes, but at the end its still a happy ending to that meat lover dog. His sacrifice his being a meat lover for the happiness of his master, but in the end it paid off and got his grand prize.",
         "Feast was shown in theaters before Disney's Big Hero 6, and serves as a nice vehicle for the fun-loving mayhem that takes place in that particular film. This short is a heartwarmer from start to finish, concerning an owner and his dog who bound over the foods they eat and the company they share while eating. This kind of connection to anyone who owns a pet is a familiar one, and it's a beautiful representation of a man/dog relationship. As expected, Disney hits the appropriate notes here, playing to ones emotions, childlike sense of whimsy, and cuteness factor in having a fun-loving dog chow down on whatever is placed in front of him. Despite all these clear and evident tactics, the short amazingly works and serves as the Best Animated Short winner for good, albeit simplistic, reasons. Directed by: Patrick Osborne and Kristina Reed.",
         "\"Feast\" is a short film by Disney which is being shown before the feature \"Big Hero 6\". While I did like this short, I was very surprised by it graphically, as it featured cel shaded graphics-- something that was briefly popular (especially with video games) about a decade ago. Now this is NOT a complaint--I really didn't mind the look of the film at all. The story is about a dog and its owner. The dog LOVES the owner because the guy spoils him rotten--giving it LOTS of human food. And, each time you see the dog, he's eating SOMETHING terrible for it, such as meatballs or bacon and eggs! However, when the man begins dating, suddenly the dog's diet changes--presumably because the man's diet changes to match the lady's. Now, the dog is getting good for you stuff--and the creature is miserable. While this would seem like a film that is a complaint about how women get between dogs and their beloved owners (such as in the Oscar-nominated \"Adam and Dog\"), it wasn't-- and its nice twist is why I am scoring this one so high. Inventive and very sweet...there's a good chance you'll see this film nominated in the Best Animated Short category at the Oscars. UPDATE: This film won the Oscar. I assume this might be due, in part, to this being the only nominee that received a large scale release (with \"Big Hero 6\").",
         "Rule of thumb: Disney (or Pixar) shorts are always amazing, and this short is no exception. Feast centers on Winston, a stray French bulldog, who was adopted by a man who would give him unhealthy table straps. But after the man finds a girlfriend, a waitress at his favorite diner, things start going green for Winston. By the end, you realize something that this short does: have a short, but well-rounded and detailed, story-line. You see everything in this story and you feel every emotion in this short, whether it's happiness and joy or depressed and sad. This short makes you feel everything going on in this small tale. I recommend watching this short in front of Big Hero 6, or on Youtube sometime. Definitely nominated for Best Animated Short at the Academy Awards next year.",
         "Correspond with the title, this short film never fail to make me feels hungry every time I watched it. I need to re-watch this short film twice to understand the whole story because I was distracted by the dog - eating all the foods given by his generous owner. The foods were so mouth-watering as I keep focusing on them. I did not realize that there was 'hidden' story behind it. At first, I thought the short film only mattered on the life of the dog and also feast - but it is not. This short film shows that pet is not just a pet. They can be our companion, part of our family or might even change our life. However, do animals have feelings? This short film has the answer - yes. They do have emotions and also have their own way of thinking to understand events around their surrounding. The dog realized that his owner is not happy, thus find his own way to try solving the problem. His passion to find the girl shown as he abandoned and ignored all the foods 'rained' upon him - even foods were all time his favourite. I love animal so much - as much as I love this short film. This film is not only about thinking our own life, but also caring about other people in our circle. Taking the first step trying to solve other's people problem never in vain. And who knows, having a pet can make us realize who we are and appreciate ourselves more.",
         "This short film tells the journey of a man's romantic relationship through the eyes of a dog. Despite it being only six minutes long, \"Feast\" is remarkably informative. It tells how a man finds love, loses love and finds love again, all in the space of six minutes, with little dialog to convey the messages. The story unfolds by the type of food the dog eats, which is interesting angle and yet it is very convincing. The animated story is very sweet. It manages to touch your heart and fills you with love and warmth, which is pretty amazing for a film that is so short. I really enjoyed it.",
         "That cut really deep, really fast. I didn't expect the sympathy that poured out of me for Winston when he yearned for junk food. And then, I found myself quite sad when he did finally get what he wanted, but at the expense of his owner's displeasure. But when when he sprinted through the kitchen with the bit of garnish to find the server, and resisted eating the steak, that was adorable. Overall, that short film was quite touching and it reminded me of my cat and I, before he passed away. It's wonderful having a companion with you; knowing you'll always have a little friend who will love you unconditionally through thick and thin.",
         "'FEAST': Four Stars (Out of Five) A 6 minute Disney animated short film; which played in theaters (including 3D ones) before the feature length Disney animated hit 'BIG HERO 6' (it's also been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, at the upcoming 87th Academy Awards). It's both hand-drawn and computer animated and tells the story a dog, that loves to eat, who's spoiled by his owner, with all kinds of human junk food. The dog's owner falls for a waitress, that works at a restaurant nearby, and we witness their relationship through the eyes of the dog. The dog's diet also changes, for the bad in his mind, because the waitress is a vegan. It was directed and co- written (with Nicole Mitchell and Raymond S. Persi) by animator, turned first time filmmaker, Patrick Osborne. The visuals are beautiful to watch (of course) and it's nice to see a love story, about humans, told through the eyes of a dog. I'm an animal lover and too often we see films told through the eyes of humans, and can only guess what any animals (in the film) might be feeling or thinking. This short is brilliantly told from the opposite perspective. Given the cool subject matter it could have been a tad more touching and emotional though. Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/D17O2xOoOCw",
         "It is Disney's habit to release a new short to accompany each animated feature, and Feast accompanies Big Hero 6. It is told from the point of view of a small dog, initially a stray, who gets himself adopted on the grounds of food. For a while we are led to believe that the story is about the dog discovering the delights of many different types of food until we understand that the film is actually telling the tale of what is happening in the home. To be frank, the final third of this short is somewhat glib and, by having a dog which is so insightful and initiative-driven yet still a plain old pet dog, Disney has gone rather further along the have-your-cake-and-eat-it path than usual. Having said that, the film is warm and full of heart, the design is simple but effective, the lighting is exquisite, and the 3D \u2013 already good - is rendered more effective by an atmosphere dense with motes and differential focus. This is a treat to watch in 3D.",
         "Your dog will always want to eat what you're eating - well, most usually, anyway, especially if it's not *good* for the dog particularly. Thank goodness, of course, this short from Disney (which won, deservedly I might hope, the Oscar for best animated short), doesn't show the aftermath of eating such things for a dog. But it's not really about that per-say, though of course if you have a dog you'll recognize it immediately as being accurate. What it's about is how a dog relates to its master, and what the filmmakers get so brilliantly in six minutes is how a dog can learn if it's put into the position to observe and react and feel its master's behavior. So at the start of this, for the first minute or so, we're just seeing how the dog loves to eat - the junkier, the better, and god help him (or her?) when it comes time to the super-bowl - but then after this, we know just from the food that things have changed. The man is eating healthier because of the girl, so the dog gets less portions and more things like, uh, soy crisps or whatever. But then the girlfriend leaves this man, and he goes into over-eating depression mode. The dog is just happy to eat... until it sinks in the master is definitely *not* happy. This must be rectified. So off to find the ex-girlfriend... Of course things are simplified into a quickness, but it's the sort of wonderful, compact, to-the-point and yet with a lot of depth and heart quickness that one has seen in other things produced by John Lassiter (though not to the same depth, I was reminded of the break-neck pace of life as the opening of Up had, how quickly life can move). And of course the dog itself is probably TOO cute, and I don't mean to say that as if to pinch the dog's cheeks, it's like they make the dog programmed to be that way... as if from a computer! At any rate, Feast is all about the love of food, but the love for humans that trumps it. It actually takes time to make the background as important as the foreground. Emotional effects/affects are really what's at stake here, not so much what the dog gets into its belly, which is what makes it so great for kids and adults - maybe adults more-so - as it plays to just making that right connection as an adult or as a kid.",
         "Not only that, but I actually preferred it to the film it accompanied Big Hero 6, though that was still a very good film and one of Disney's better films since the Renaissance. As a big fan of Disney, other than ending ever so slightly predictably Feast was an absolute treat, dealing with its mature subject simply and maturely. It's beautifully animated for a start, style-wise it's clever with its mix of hand-drawn and computer animation, it's beautifully drawn and modelled and the colours are vibrant and vivid. The music has energy and sweet charm, which is fitting with the tone of the story. It's simply but charmingly written with plenty of amusement and heart, likable in characterisation with sweet characters, without being mawkish, and voiced with enthusiasm but the star here is the story. The story is short and simple, but told in a cute, touching and heart-warming way with some nice humour thrown into the mix, was impressed with how much it packed in in a short running time and as said already how it dealt its subject matter with such mature simplicity and not at all shallowly or overdone in sentimentality. All in all, I found Feast to be a beautiful short and it deserved its Academy Award/Oscar win. 9/10 Bethany Cox",
         "A man's best friend to the very end. The story is about a man's love life is seen through the eyes of his best friend and dog, Winston, and revealed bite by bite through the meals they share. Feast is a 6 minute short film that by now judging on the date of this review, this short film has been nominated for Best Short Film at the Oscars and who knows... it might win. Okay so this a short film and that means this review might not be has long as my other reviews, so basically it's a short little review on this cheerful short film, well it might be a long review. I got to say that the first ever scene in this short film with the little dog barking and being a happy puppy was the cutest and the most adorable thing I've seen since the beginning of the 2008 film Bolt. Have you ever got that feeling inside of you that it's so cute that you can't take to much cuteness, yeah that's this. What Feast got so beautifully well is showing a cute little dog who loves junk food and in the background there's another story happening with two lovers and they relationship, but has the short goes along it quickly turns surprisingly depressing. Feast is only 6 minutes long and it brilliantly give you all the cuteness, cheerfulness, depression and back to happy again and Feast gives you all that in a matter of 6 minutes, it's a bit like Up with the opening scene where you already know everything about them and it's only last for a couple of minutes, I mean that right there is masterpiece of directing and writing. The animation is so colorful and so beautifully bright that the animation is the icing on the cake for this touching and a well made short film.",
         "When I was waiting for Big Hero 6, this short movie was first shown before Big Hero 6 starts. Feast made me cry, and made me love my Dogs even more! Feast was short BUT it has a so Deep Message! Because I have 2 Dogs (Family) and it saddens me leaving them because I have to go to another country and will be staying there forever. I was thinking if I'll plan to return to visit back our house, it would probably take 10-20 years before I visit, I was thinking, will I ever still see my dogs again? Will I be able to still hug, kiss, and feel their presence ever again? There's a chance I would return for visit, but it would take longer, but I'm so worried because of the span of time and their span of life. I had my dogs almost for 2 years, and for me, it wasn't enough to show HOW I Love Them! now that I'm leaving. I'm a little bit comfortable of their safety, since my Dad will be left to take good care of them. But I really wish, once I return, I could still see them, feel their love, feel their presence, kiss & hug them, and see more of them ^_^ Thats why when I saw this short movie, it made me cry a little (I'm a man) Also its a Great short Movie! I Love you Tobi & Bb!(my 2 dogs/family)",
         "Before watching Big Hero 6 today (which was great) I had to sit through this misandristic claptrap short called Feast. Written and produced by a woman, it told the story of a dog called Winston and his owner who liked to give the dog his leftovers. He was happy. The dog was happy. Then he got a girlfriend. The meatballs and fried breakfasts were replaced with sprouts and parsley sprigs. The dog was miserable. The bloke presumably put up with it as he was getting laid. Then she left. The bloke was immediately happy again as he got to eat the food he liked. The dog was happy as he did too. But then the poor man got sad because he had been silly and let the wonderful woman slip through his grasp. But the dog, ever trying to please his master, chased the woman down and they got married. Dog miserable again. Until one day a meatball lands at his feet. The baby had thrown it. Dog and baby happy. So what's the moral of this movie? As far as I can tell it is either A) men are dogs B) men are slobs that like baby food C) women are superior as they eat celery D) if men want to be happy, eat what they want and have fun with their dog, they should avoid women.",
         "Watched this animated short before Big Hero 6 with my movie theatre-working friend. This was quite a treat seeing-mostly from the dog's point of view-his eating various foods that aren't considered nutritious or the regular dog food. Enjoying those while his master goes through some joys and woes of getting in and out of relationships as well as possibly being unemployed for a while as evidenced by some times the pet is not tended to. The sequences seem mostly in dolly mode with few cuts when segueing from one food stuff to another. The drawing style seems unique to this short though maybe that has to do with the paint style, I don't know. Anyway, Feast was quite a treat-so to speak-of an animated short from Walt Disney Studios.",
         "The dog was cute and the animation style was cool. The problem with me was the actual storyline. First, it took forever to get to the actual plot, I mean a dog acting cute and happy over human food is well, cute and funny but I want to see a story too. The story ended up being the same old tiring love story and the dog reuniting the two lovers. I was reminded of Paperman and The Blue Umbrella... and I loved those shorts. This seemed just like those. Sorry, but next time, please make a short that is different, like you did with Get a Horse. This short was at least better than the feature that followed it. Average. 5/10.",
         "This video was pure enjoyment. I've never felt more emotion in a movie theater before in my life. The part when the dog brought together the miserable man and the woman he broke up with nearly made me break into tears as to see how loving the dog is and how much he really cares for his human. When they had children made me even happier. Going to the beginning when the dog stared out as a stray and was fed a french fry made me so happy, I thought the dog was going to struggle for the rest of his life. How he took him n and fed him anything he wanted filled my heart with joy. I loved this mini movie and would definitely watch it again if I could.",
         "I saw this short film for the first time taking my little sister to see big hero six. I thoroughly enjoyed this short. I enjoy most animated shorts and this one did not fall \"short\" (sorry for the pun.) It takes you through a very mature subject through the eyes of a small puppy i don't want to spoil anything. the animation was not my favorite but to get an entire story through in less then ten minutes. this seem's very difficult to do. It also was a nice change from the boring commercials they usually playing in the movie theater. It is also an adorable dog. just in case, this next part may or may not contains spoilers. the story line was funny. that is more then I can say about a lot of full time movies. It was also clever. Im a writer and telling a story through a dogs eyes never crossed my mind. -dr nerdy",
         "Absolutely tasteless and totally wrong. Beware of this animation short, it could damage your kids behavior! \"Feast\"(2014) animated short in just 6 minutes had been promoting: 1.Fast Food unhealthy diet and human obesity connected with that: dog's owner character (out of the focus hero) is unshapely obese. 2.Compulsive Eating Disorder: \"when in trouble eat a lot of ice- cream!\" 3. Hatred for vegetables: Puppy puking in the kid's animated short?? Really! 4. Neglect of your pet's health via wrong diet: Wouldn't your kids think it is cool to feed your family dog with all the food trash left after watching this short? 5. Reproducing all these mentioned above wrong ways in the behavior of the newborn kid of the pet owners characters. And the Academy Award of the year goes for the 6 min of kid's total brainwashing.",
         "A beautiful animated short with a touching story about a dog and his owner, a single young man who eats a lot of junk food. The owner shares his eating habits with his dog, much to the pooch's delight as he loves the human food more than the dog food he's given. Eventually the man meets a woman and his eating habits change, which means the dog no longer gets the tasty food he was getting. I won't spoil what happens next but the story takes a heartwarming turn that is sure to put a big goofy smile on your face. It's a great short with lovely, colorful animation and charming music. It's a very simple story but well told with humor and heart. It definitely deserved its Oscar win.",
         ". . . a piece of film as you'll find anywhere. Though it's sure to appeal to dog lovers, it's not certain that the average \"cat\" person will get it. FEAST illustrates how dogs are willing to make ultimate sacrifices on behalf of their human masters. They are loyal to a fault. They have an uncanny knack of intuiting what their human needs in times of crisis. Though the plot of this six-minute story has unexpected twists and turns, the viewer figures everything will probably turn out okay, because there's a dog and a dog lover present. The film makers here do not waste a moment of your time, as each twist of their tale is more amazing than the previous one. Cats are famous survivors, and the sort of people who keep them seem pretty masochistic. Loyal dogs sometimes starve to death on the graves of their masters. If a cat was hungry, and the only thing to eat was \"their\" human, you know what would happen. It's a fate that befalls several American \"cat ladies\" (those who have 50 or more felines in their homes) several times each year.",
         "Disney knows how to entertain its public and this can be seen in this short movie. We are told the story of a man and his puppy who live together in peace and harmony. Until an unforeseen event occurs, the puppy becomes a little bit upset, but discovers soon how to handle the situation and restore the atmosphere that was once in the house. Oh, I love happy endings.",
         "When Feast (2014) wins Oscar in the 'Best Animated Short Film' category,i was pretty much excited to watch this.And this film is really worth it.Story is based on winston,cute little bulldog who was adopted by a man from street.This film showed us a dog's love towards his master and also how much it loves its food but love for its master comes in the first place.And we also see a man's love life through the whole film and how much it changes his lifestyle.The sacrifice winston made to fix his master's love life reminds us again that dog is man's best friend.Disney's short films are always amazing and Feast was additionally heart touching.",
         "At the cinema this short animated film played before Disney Pixar film Big Hero 6. Basically a stray male Boston Terrier puppy is eating from discarded food wrappers, when a man named James drops a French fry on the ground, the dog easts it, James offers him a second, then takes him home. James names the dog Winston and begins feeding him as his pet, giving him portions of his own meals and junk food in addition to his traditional dog food, and Winston loves it. But things change when one day James starts a relationship with a waitress at a local restaurant, where he takes Winston with him, feeding him the leftovers, but she persuades James to have a healthier diet and lifestyle, meaning that Winston's leftovers and food consists of vegetables, which he hates. Winston resists eating most of his meals, but then James is sent into a deep depression when he and the girlfriend break up, meaning he reverts back to his old ways and eating habits, Winston is happy again, but he recognises his owner is in low spirits. So Winston snatches a piece of parsley, that James kept as a reminder of his girlfriend, and he races out of the apartment to find her, James follows Winston to the restaurant, and there he and the girlfriend reconcile, and they soon after get married. The couple move into a new house together, Winston chases some meatballs falling on the floor, and goes up to a high chair occupied by the couple's infant child, the baby happily throws more meatballs to him, the film ends with Winston ready to feat on cupcakes knocked off the table during the child's first birthday party. This is a good film, seeing from the perspective of a dog, meaning that human characters are mostly seen from his height, and only facially when he jumps up, the dog is of course the endearing character, and the simple story is both funny and sweet, and the combination of hand-drawn and computer animation works very well, it is a great short animated film. It won the Oscar for Best Short Animated Film. Very good!"
