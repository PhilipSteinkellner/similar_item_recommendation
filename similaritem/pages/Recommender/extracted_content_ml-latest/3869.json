         "Leave it to the ZAZ boys (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker) to bring back the stupidity, insanity and downright madness of Leslie Nielsen and company while also deflating cop films, government conspiracies the movie \"Ghost\" and the grace of ballroom dancing. In \"The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear\", Det. Frank Drebin (Nielsen) and his fellow cop cronies (Kennedy, Simpson) discover the lovely Jane (Presley) while protecting energy expert Professor Mainheimer (Griffiths) from evil guy Quentin Hapsburg (Goulet!) and his nefarious plans.... But you don't care about the plot, do you? No, and well you shouldn't; the gags are the thing in these films and they not only come fast and furious but wild and wooly, down and dirty and good and dumb. Just the way I like them. You'll lose count of the sight gags, double over at the double-entendres and guffaw at the puns and wonder, thought it all, why it is that all sequels can't be as good as this. Especially sequels that contain Barabara Bush abuse. Another good case, Drebin! Ten stars and a gold copy of \"Unchained Melody\" for \"The Naked Gun 2 1/2\", where \"Fear\" never \"Smell\"ed so funny.",
         "I just saw this film with a couple of friends and some beers and man we laughed so damn hard at it..It had some gags i didn't even remembered, The one that got us crying in laughter is at the very ending when a bunch of people are asleep and one of them is all arched in a weird way sleeping in a table..you gotta see it to get it...How ridiculous and funny it was!!!!! Leslie Nielson is a great guy I'm so sorry about his performance in Scarymovie 3 and those movies that squashed the good and funny memories movies like these gave us fans. Priscila Presley is Gorgeous...she looks fine...but this movie dates back to 1992..so i guess now a days she must look very old..I guess. Anyhow the film was great and i remember good as yesterday the time this film came out, it came out a week before The Terminator 2 and Leslie Nielsen used to do this television spots saying: Hasta la vista..baby...they were so damn funny..I hope someone remembers them...Or someone gets them for a DVD. its a definite 10 out of 10 on Comedy.",
         "When a bomb goes off in the offices of a research body looking an alternative energy sources, Lieutenant Frank Drebin is put on the case. Things are made harder when he finds that his ex-girlfriend (Jane) is one of the staff there. As unlikely as it seems, Drebin uncovers a sinister plot involving the heavy fuel lobby to kidnap the President's adviser and replace him with a look-alike that will say what they want. However, with nobody believing him, Frank is forced to take action to expose the leader of the plot \u0096 Jane's new lover, Quentin Hapsburg. Following on from the success of the first film, Frank Drebin is given a second outing and, as before, the humour is silly but comes in heavy doses, creating a pretty consistent tone to the film. The plot is, of course, nonsense and all you really need to know is that, as before, Drebin uncovers a plot that nobody believes while at the same time having love life problems \u0096 but surely nobody will be watching this for the plot (and don't call me Shirley). Instead you will come to this for the steady delivery of absurdly silly jokes, all delivered with straight faces from all the cast. It is rather hit and miss but mostly the jokes are amusing even if there aren't as many laugh out loud moments as I would have liked. The addition of a lot of crude material didn't help and I felt it sucked a bit of the sense of fun out of the film. That is not to say that I didn't laugh out loud (I did) but most of the time I was just chuckling \u0096 which is good enough for my money. A big reason the film is funny is the cast. As always, Nielsen is brilliant at this sort of thing when he is given the material. Here he is not as good as his best stuff (due to the material) but he is still the core of this film and is consistently good. Presley has less to do but is good at the straight-faced stuff. OJ and Kennedy have small roles but they are funny with what they have. Goulet is not as good as Montalban from the first film but he has some nice moments. Overall this is very funny if you are in the mood and, even if you're not, there is still much to enjoy here and it is consistently pretty funny with a real hatful of belly laughs. Not the most high brow of entertainment then but, if you're a fan of the genre then you should love this.",
         "David Zucker, the director of this spoof, shows he can give the viewer a fun time because the way he gave the right touch to this funny movie. \"The Naked Gun 2-1/2\" is a film which makes fun of other movies about an inept police detective who does everything wrong, but in doing so, he gives us an occasion for laughter that in most of the situations work. Of course, one wouldn't imagine anyone playing this Lt. Frank Drebin, but Leslie Nielsen. This actor with the rubber face, is a natural for this type of comedy. The opening sequence with the White House dinner with the older Bushies is a hoot. Poor Barbara Bush is the butt of all the visual jokes as she is seated next to Drebin. But the best moment in the film is the rendition of \"Besame Mucho\" by Mr. Nielsen and George Kennedy dressed in mariachi costumes. It is a riot! The leading lady, Priscilla Presley, seems to be the perfect match for Mr. Nielsen. They play well together. The others in the film, George Kennedy, Robert Goulet, Richard Griffiths, and the rest, do an excellent job in their clowning around to produce the laughter and good time we experience. This is a film to recommend to anyone suffering depression.",
         "This one has Lt. Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) trying to stop villain Quentin Hapsburg (Robert Goulet) from kidnapping a solar power advocate. That's the plot, but the movie is of course an excuse for a series of gags, many of which just pop out from the sides. And of course there's Frank's relationship with seductive Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley). One of their scenes might make you recall a certain scene from \"Ghost\", and then what follows...well, all that I can say is: HOW DO THEY COME UP WITH THESE THINGS?!!!!!!!!!!!!! I guess that the movie's only weird aspect is seeing O.J. Simpson as Nordberg. But if we can ignore that, the rest is a hoot, especially the opening sequence, the outlines of people's bodies, and the zoo scene. Just great.",
         "Jim Abrahams and David and Jerry Zucker learned something from 1982. Their sequel to Airplane!, their smash hit, was named Airplane 2: The Sequel, but to their sequel to The Naked Gun was something that would be copied forever: Naked Gun 2 ½: The Smell of Fear. From now on, sequels never were just had `2' after it, it's always `2 ½' or `2.33'. And, thankfully, the title's shorter. Leslie Nielsen's hilarious character of Frank Drebin is back for more adventures. He and his girlfriend Jane (Priscilla Presley) have broken up; he hasn't gotten over it, while she's going out with Quentin Hapsburg (Robert Goulet). What she doesn't know is that Hapsburg is in a conspiracy to avoid solar energy by doing a whole kidnapping scheme. It's up to Drebin, Nordberg (O.J. Simpson), and Ed Hocken (George Kennedy) to save the day! Amazingly enough, many of the jokes from the first one (which I admit I don't remember much about) weren't repeated in this sequel. It would be hard to repeat much of those jokes, which would be impossible to change in any ways. Therefore, most of the jokes were fresh and hilarious. It did take a little while to get started, though, for there was about a fifteen minute stretch where there were no laughs, it was just for exposition, which I guess was OK, but I wanted more humor to start off with. Nielsen was perfect for the part. I'm glad that he hasn't `sold out' like other comedians and gone on to dramatic roles. He delivers his lines almost like he didn't know he was in a comedy, which is always funnier than any other types. Many times, he misunderstands what is said, and other times he says something that you wouldn't expect him to say in 100 years. One of the funniest sequences in the film is a parody of Bond-ish films, when Drebin and someone else are fighting in a bathroom, and seem to be having trouble fighting when a towel is thrown on their heads, etc. For once, a film has a formidable sequel. Amazingly enough, it's a film that's just as funny as the first. My rating: 8/10 Rated PG-13 for sexual humor.",
         "The first \"Naked Gun\" movie is one of the best spoofs of all time. I'm not a huge fan of the genre but even I think it's incredibly, side-splittingly outrageous - this last time I saw it I laughed so hard I cried. The sequels of course were intended to cash in on the surprise success of the original (which was based on the ZAZ trio's failed TV show, \"Police Squad,\" hence the subtitle on the film). For the most part, both sequels were entertaining and funny. Although it's nowhere near as good as the original, \"Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear\" is a worthy continuation of the epic saga (just kidding about the epic bit) - all in all it's just good fun. Leslie Nielsen returns as Lt. Frank Drebin, this time out to foil the plans of a mad industrialist (Robert Goulet). It seems a respected doctor has found a new method of preserving earth's natural resources and foregoing oils, gasoline, and other elements. Fearing financial bankruptcy, the companies kidnap the doctor and replace him with an identical \"clone\" of sorts, so the truth cannot come out. However, the doctor's assistant is Frank's old flame (played by Priscilla Presley). Frank looks into the case while rekindling a relationship with the woman of his dreams. David Zucker returned to direct this film with the help of brother Jerry and pal Jim Abrahams. If I recall correctly, the third film was not made by them, so it's interesting to see them tackling a sequel to a film of theirs - something they don't usually do (they also passed on \"Airplane 2\"). For the most part this film is quite funny and has some really good gags, but it's also littered with some mediocre ones, as many spoofs of these sorts are. Nielsen is still hilarious as Drebin and all around him act simply to accommodate his talents. George Kennedy and O.J. Simpson also return to their roles. If you enjoyed the first film, chances are you'll also enjoy this. Basically it's in the same vein of the first film and delivers a good range of slapstick gags, some of which will have you in a fit. But you won't be gasping for breath like you did when you saw the first \"Naked Gun\" movie.",
         "Lieutenant Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) is now working in Washington D.C. with his two partners (Oscar-Winner:George Kennedy and O.J. Simpson). Their job is see if everything goes smooth for Dr. Albert Meinheimer (Richard Griffiths) speech for the President of the United States (John Roarke). His speech could be highly controversial for the whole world, since it involves the country's energy program. Quentin Haspburg (Robert Goulet) kidnaps Dr. Albert Meinheimer before the speech by using a look-like, which he doesn't want the world industry of fossil and nuclear fuels instead of the environmental ones. But Frank is still heartbroken after he left his girlfriend Jane (Priscilla Presley), who's now working for Dr. Meinherimer. Directed by David Zucker (Airplane!, BASEketball, Ruthless People) made an enjoyable sequel to the original. The cast seems to be having an great time and there's some original new gags as well. This sequel was just as big at the box office like the original did. Although the film critics had mixed opinions with this one. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an good digitally remastered Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes the teaser trailer, original theatrical trailer and an humorous commentary track by the director, producer:Robert K. Weiss and Host:Peter Tilder. \"The Naked Gun 2 1/2:The Smell of Fear\" perphas lacks some of the great gags of the original. But if you enjoy spoof comedies, don't miss this one. TV Version adds some additional footage. Written by the director and Pat Proft (Bachelor Party, Hot Shots!, Police Academy). (****/*****).",
         "The Naked Gun: From the files of Police Squad was a huge hit back in 1988, so three years later, everyone returns for this funny sequel. LT. Frank Drebin is back (The legend that is Leslie Nielsen) he's now split from Girlfriend Jane (Pricilla Presley) whose now involved romantically with shady Businessman Quentin Hapsburg (Robert Goulet). Drebin and his cop buddies, Capt Ed Hocken (George Kennedy) & Det. Norberg (O.J.Simpson) investigate when a Scientist Dr Meinheimer (Richard Griffiths) who advocates Solar Energy ahead of Oil,Coal & Nuclear prepares to publish his report to the President, Is suddenly kidnapped and a doppelganger (Griffiths Again) is put in his place. So LT Drebin once again hilariously saves the day. The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear, while does have a quick cash-in feel, is actually a really good sequel which is almost as good as the original, With funny Gags throughout, The Zucker Brothers and Pat Proft are on top form again. **** out of ***** Follwed by The Naked Gun 33 1/3 : The Final Insult, while still good and a masterpiece compared to Diasater Movie (2008) or Epic Movie (2007) is slightly inferior to it's predecessors",
         "People say most sequels to hit comedies do bad, and ruin the amazing feeling of a good funny movie. In my opinion, Naked Gun 2 1/2 doesn't fall into that category. Leslie Nielson is back, as detective Frank Drebin, with Elvis's wife. I laughed nearly as hard as I did for the first one, because it's genius. It's not stupid, pointless or disappointing. I don't see how anyone can't laugh and be satisfied with this film. I watched this one exactly as I did with the first one. With pizza and Coke, I laughed and spat out because I couldn't help it. My friend actually told me to pause the movie so he can laugh everything out. Watch this film, you won't be disappointed with this amazing and funny sequel. Many laughs you won't forget."
