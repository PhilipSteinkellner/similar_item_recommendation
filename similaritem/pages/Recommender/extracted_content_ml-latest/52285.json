      "synopsis": "Rexxx, a much pampered celebrity dog with a rich diet and corresponding lifestyle is the victim of a stunt gone wrong. Believed to be killed in a headlong fall from a plane his Hollywood owner tearfully arranges a memorial service. In the meantime and miles away Rexxx with new-found street smarts become a street dog, outfoxes an animal control officer with his circus-like gymnastic ability and literally comes into contact with Shane Fahey (Josh Hutcherson) who is cutting school at the time. When all attempts to find his owner fail the dog is adopted by the son of the fire chief of the run-down and undervalued Dog Patch firehouse. His name at this point changes to Dewey, taken from the name tag he was wearing when he was originally found. Soon seen by all who come into contact with him as a Wonder Dog, he helps the boy to find a new purpose in life, rescues the regional fire chief, becomes a mascot for the struggling Dog Patch firehouse and assists in solving a mystery concerning the death of a family member, at the same time undoing a conspiracy that could result in the closure of the firehouse. When news of his amazing feats breaks out in the media he briefly returns to his original owners but is dissatisfied by the lack of activity and excitement there. When he hears a fire truck siren he runs off once again to join his new fire family. Reluctantly his owners realize that he is better off with young Fahey and give the dog to him so that he can continue to be the station mascot.",

         "I used this comment on a thread somewhere in here, and just thought I'd add my two cents on a quick review: I went to the theater with the intention of seeing \"Meet the Robinsons\" but it was sold out, so with a choice of \"Blades of Glory\" and \"Firehouse Dog\", I opted for the dog flick. I wasn't disappointed. It is a cute film, sure there are the boring and not-so-brilliant crude fart jokes, but the film is not so much about the dog, but about the relationship between a father and son, as they both work through a serious life altering event that they both experienced in the recent past. In the story there is a bit a mystery and sleuthing involved, drama, humor and some silliness with the dog that I didn't find it too over-the-top. The relationships of those who live and work at the firehouse are also part of the story and the fires add some excitement and adventure. I enjoyed the film, but wouldn't call it a blockbuster or anything. The kids in the theater were attentive throughout and everyone there seemed to enjoy it also.",
         "4 out of 10? What? Who the hell is voting on this, people who enjoyed \"Dude, where's my car?\" or Canadian's who want to have a chip on their shoulder about film-making in their own country, if other comments on this site are to be believed. Well, personally I don't care where the film was made, I watched it with my family and I enjoyed it. Yes, it's Disney style corny, but the funny bits are funny, the touching bits are touching and ultimately you're routing for the dog and the fire crew. Starring the underrated Bruce Greenwood and a decent supporting crew the film is fun for the family as the story of a pampered Hollywood pooch who learns what being a dog is really all about moves at a decent pace with gags that children will enjoy with a few extra bizarre touches for adults as well. and for those people who give it 4, have you people seen Batman and Robin, Cool as Ice, of the abysmal Legends of the fall. Personally I suggest you watch these first before slating this. 6 out of 10.",
         "I gave it such a high rating not b/c I think it's such a great movie, but b/c it did what a family/kid movie is supposed to do - make you laugh, keep the kids' (and my) attention, and not make you fall asleep. It did all of those things. Based on some of these reviews here, I expected it to absolutely stink. But my kids who are 4 and 6, and I thought maybe too young for this type of movie, were riveted. They liked the silly humor, and when the father and son had their screen time together my son cuddled with me and was obviously moved. And I didn't feel like pulling my hair out and I never checked my watch. All of this made for a fun, worth-the-matinée-price, movie experience. On top of it, my husband took the kids to see this movie last week; so this was my first time, and their second - and they sat still through it the whole way. Funny, sweet, enjoyable movie.",
         "This is a movie the kids are sure to enjoy, yea it has the same plot most movies of this genera have, bad guy, good guy, and a animal hero, with a couple added new things in it. Over all its worth a rental if nothing else. The best actor is the \"Dog\" , not to say the human actors were that bad but the movie focuses on the mutt and that's what you should get out of it. It will probably be a rental fairly quickly and that is what i would recommend for those not willing to fork out 60$ bucks to take the family. As an adult i thought it was a half way decent film, not boring even if it is a bit predictable. If you like animal acting type films , you should like this one.",
         "Funny, Suspenseful and with a message. I attended Firehouse Dog, not really knowing much about what it was about, and expected to see a cheesy kids movie. Boy, was I wrong. Blown away is more like it. Firehouse Dog pulls you in from the beginning, introduces it's characters, and tugs at your emotions. There are all kinds of emotions you feel in this movie. I laughed so hard my sides hurt, I got choked up and my heart swelled with emotion. If you want to entertain the whole family, and provide a positive message, definitely see this movie. One of the best movies of the year! It's too bad that movies like this don't receive an Oscar, because a lot of thought got put into the story given in the movie.",
         "I was surprised when I saw the rating and thought about not going and seeing this movie. But, my wife and I were looking for a movie to take the children to see - difficult to find these days. We went and were pleasantly surprised by the total movie experience. Laughter throughout the theater during many parts of this film. Sure, some plot scenarios were far fetched but for a family movie, a comedy and a dog star type movie this movie was excellent. I have learned that the dog is an Irish Terrier - what a fantastic personality this animal has. I sincerely encourage everyone of all ages to see this movie. Look at it as a fun family film - not as an Oscar winning drama of great significance but certainly much better than the rating indicates.",
         "Shane has some problems. As a middle schooler, he has been doing poorly on exams. This is because his single parent father, Marc (Bruce Greenwood) is a captain in the fire department and is one the job a great deal of the time. In addition, Shane's uncle died in a fire about a year ago and his father is still mourning the loss of his brother. No wonder Shane is suffering from lack of parental attention and direction. But, one day, a dog is rescued by the fire department on top of a burning building. Shane and his father take the dog home. Unknown to them, this is no ordinary mutt but a movie star canine who was lost during a parachuting screen shoot. Although Shane does not like the dog at first, the little furry one is talented and wins over the boy's heart. And, he also becomes a great fire dog, leading to the rescue of another fire captain. But, will the real owner of the dog come back to claim him? And, just who is setting all of these fires in an already decaying neighborhood? This is a terrific family movie. Yes, it is implausible, at times, but it does not matter in the least. The adorable dog of the film is smart, talented, and will melt hearts. The cast, although mostly unknown actors, is also just right for the film. The costumes, sets and movie production values are fine, too. Then again, many children and adults are interested in fire fighting and this flick has plenty of minutes devoted to battling blazes. In short, if you want to get a new and worthy film for your family's enjoyment, this is a terrific choice. It will have everyone cheering and clapping for the brave little canine and his taller companions.",
         "Watched this because I like dogs. The dog itself was perfect - some sort of Irish terrier cross - very \"doggy\" looking. The story was quite good I thought. The nasty little boy turns out to be quite a pleasant fellow.......although I think he is meant to be adorable! Couldn't understand more than 30% of what anybody was saying, but that didn't really matter - they all seemed quite standard people with nothing interesting to say. The firemen were a sort of Keystones Cops bunch - a black person, a Latino, a woman and a blond chap who seemed quite stupid. Unlike other reviewers I didn't mind the relatively coarse scenes of the dog farting and snoring....I did however object to the scene where the dog has been reunited with his original owner who - to celebrate - offers the animal a variation on a group of hookers - three differently colored poodles! This really seemed vulgar and not particularly suitable for the children who are presumably the target audience - but then indoctrination can't start too soon!!",
         "The Music is a very pleasant adaptation of several Western Medieaval tunes. The Magic Realism which North America has laid somewhat of a claim to, is lovely used here, of course giving a 'true' canine touch to the supernatural stuff. The scenery and imagery is breathtaking !! And the many boys, who's story this is, are a true delight. With it's colorful, comic events and adventure, it became my favorite. Mama plays great too, and the director has a gentle and good touch for all the other kids, which means he is a fine craftsman. Though details elude our memory, I recall an inexplicably cheerful little man and people in colored saran wrap. I fail to see what was \"great\" about the land, other than a volcano that burped glitter. Moments after viewing it, I need only say the title to send everyone into fits of laughter and gagging sounds. This earns \"The Doghouse Fire\" my resounding two thumbs way up. Were we to judge it on a star ratings system, it would be a spangled banner. Soft, laid back, nostalgic and utterly charming, this story is a heartwarming winner, and can't be recommended enough !! What an enormous pleasure !",
         "This was not a bad film. It features the typical pampered character finds himself in a slightly reduced setting, except in this case the character is a dog. The Hollywood pooch finds himself in a firehouse about to be torn down after an aerial stunt goes wrong, and they adopt him, and he saves the day in more ways than one. I loved all the stunts involving the dog, and the rescue scenes were well-executed, as was most of the film. Of course, the kids grows throughout the movie, as when he first meets the dog he hates it but grows to love it, and develops from rebellious to responsible. I think I studied this theme in college literature classes. This was overall a good movie, and I recommend it. *** out of ****"
