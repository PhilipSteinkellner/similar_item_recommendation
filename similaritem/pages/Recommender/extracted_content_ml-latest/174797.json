         "Hi everyone ,this time about an director who does writer director collaboration every-time which is an very healthy thing .. The movie \"Kavan\" revolves around the plot of television media and its real face..I said it is most happening movie because knowingly or unknowingly the story had a big connect to TN nowadays .. Story wise the three writers and the director stand big ... \"K.V. Anand\" this time didn't manipulate more commercialism in the movie especially the second half of the movie..A true respect for him for that ..It shows even big director like him and also big stars can avoid regular commercial factors and at the same time can give a interesting flick.. VJ sethupathy ,pandirajan,and vikranth,were really a plus for the movie. Dialogues were really good ,finally i need to say about the last 30 minutes of the movie where the real break down of conflicts happen ..but i dint want break the twist here ,go and watch it in theater for some real faces of Indian media.. Overall it will be a new K.V Anand movie with minimal commercial factors and more of conflicts",
         "Director K.V.Anand keeps us engaging for 160 minutes with Kavan. The movie may have been based on some Clichés, but the movie is taken from a fresh perspective of what happens behind the cameras of the media. K.V.Anand is known for thinking out of the box, if you look at his movies \"Matraan\",\"Ayan\",\"Anegan\",etc. The movie had a fast screenplay,for instance ,the movie's first 10 minutes was equal to an average Tamil movie, Such fast-paced the movie was. the main plot may have gotten buried upon all the things happening in the movie,the Audience may never even get the time to notice it. \"Kavan\" prompts the Audience to use their brains to all the things they were oblivious in the past. Further, reviewing the movie without spoiling was that all the songs were good, HipHop Tamizha has done a good job, the songs will be in your head for a while, although the background scores could have been made more engaging. Coming to the cast,it had \"Makkal Selvan\" Vijay Sethupathy as the lead and Madonna Sebastin, they both have done a perfect job and the other cast includes actors from 3 Generations like TR and Pandian has helped in making the movie more reachable to all types of audiences. The one scene that was worth mentioning was the Pre-Interval block scene,it was unpredictable and gripping like most of the scenes in the movie. K.V.Anand has used all the cast as perfect as possible, which is where many others fail. Overall the movie will give you the immense satisfaction of watching something never before. So, I suggest you to watch it in theaters.",
         "The movie was good. The story was also good in the movie. Everyone acted very well in the movie. Songs and BGM in the movie was superb. Good movie.",

First things first. 'Kavan' is the kind of movie that the urban crowd generally passes for 'an entertainer' these days.

         "First things first. 'Kavan' is the kind of movie that the urban crowd generally passes for 'an entertainer' these days. The screenplay is racy, the narration is lightning-fast (predominantly in the first half) and the performances delightfully over-the-top. KV Anand sticks to his typical screenplay-template..an enjoyable fusion of masala moments coupled with the usual must-haves..well- shot songs, a villain (or two) who's painted completely in dark strokes, a syrupy romance that really doesn't speak volumes about either of the lovers, and also, a decent number of twists. The initial half of 'Kavan' mostly deals with the rat race between channels and their tendencies to stoop to any level just to boost TRP ratings and take viewers for a toss. Sethupathi (playing Thilak \u2013 a newbie journalist) is again at his relaxed best, who at several occasions, gets to unfurl his mass-movie persona. The dialogues written for him also happen to be some of the most astute in the entire film. T Rajendherr (who plays Mayilvaganan, a struggling channel director) does exactly what's required of him..to be himself in the most in-your- face, unapologetic (grizzly) way. Madonna's Malar is more or less a foil to Sethupathi's character and barely gets to record an eventful inning. Akashdeep Saigal (from Anand's earlier venture 'Ayan') gets quite a meaty villain role and he plays it to the galleries when required. Some of the digs taken at the media industry are packaged interestingly well whereas some are painfully pretentious. Writers Su-Ba add the right measure of sensation and pulpy feel to the screenplay that takes its own sweet time (hundred and sixty minutes) to reach conclusion. T Rajendherr holds much greater screen-time in the second half compared to the first and those who are familiar with his rhyming lines and wacky responses will obviously have a ball watching him bring the house down. Cinematography by Abhinandan Ramanujam is certainly a major plus (the frames look grandiose almost throughout). Music by Hip Hop Thamizha impresses (especially 'Oxygen' and 'Theeratha Vilayattu Pilla') and thankfully, their ideal placement ensures that they just don't appear to be horrible speed-breakers. The comedy is at times flawed (with chauvinistic overtones) but mostly chuckle-worthy. The viewer is likely to be reminded of Anand's earlier films 'Ko' and 'Anegan' for the similarities in style of presentation (along with Shankar's 'Mudhalvan' mostly during the interview sequences). Cameos from Nasser and Powerstar are executed skilfully. The screenplay does lose some steam at the start of the second half but overall, 'Kavan' is definitely going to please the average viewer who purely expects to be entertained (leaving logic at the door, as and when urged to!). P.S \u2013 That innovative interval block was a bit of pure genius!",
         "{watched with subtitles} KAVAN is about media mafia. Vijay Sethupathi is the only character who gets space in movie to perform, and he is up to the mark. I didn't like music, it is so loud. Only climax part of the movie is good, all other scenes are not well elevated.",
         "The movie started off in a normal way but the way the power of media proved to be good as well as bad. Vijay Sethupathy's way of using pun in his dialogue took the heat of the media required for the movie to a different level. I felt that they cornered the media into too much of negative side which is slightly cinematic from reality. Especially, TR's role in the movie is mind blowing. All casts were well used and made a great impact in the movie. K.V. Anand and his love for media and politics again came into perfection after \"KO\"..",
         "This movie comes at you with the subtlety of a train wreck. The villains are comically poor, the plotting ridiculous and the entire story could have been drafted by a group of well trained monkeys. Vijay Sethupathi does himself no favors as he apparently attempts to move from intelligent hero to unintelligible icon. I got tired of groaning, there were so many over the top unbelievable scenes. It is hard to choose what is the worst - the story, the dialogues or the acting. Split three ways, perhaps?",
         "The movie began in a artful manner, which is very different for a KV Anand movies.And later connected to the audience as a Kollywood dish. The narration of elements and his own dialogue delivery of VJ Sethupathi. With KV Anand's own recipe of twist the movie is a perfect blend of pure entertainer. This movie is a perfect tribute to T.Rajender and Pandiraj who were entertainers of the past decades.",
         "Firstly kudos to the director kv Anand, Subha and Kabilan for putting their effort in telling the most happening story interestingly ! Tamil industries needs more collaborations in their story making or directing process for the betterment of the industries. The first half interesting and gripping. The team were successful showing the dark side media in a funnier and simpler way. but the in the second half the story becomes more filmy/unrealistic ( compared to the first half )and becomes loosely packed by deviating a little bit/ The cast is perfect. VJS is in other league compared to other actors right now. Madonna, Jagan, Bose Venkat, pandiarajan have done justice to their role. I felt some of TR's one liners boring and unnecessary and the villain dubbing was awful. Music was apt, Oxygen and the bharathiyar songs were v good. editing could have been better. Except the last 30 mins, movie maintains a high pace and draws the crowd well enough. Final verdict : This movie just falls short of being a blockbuster. But it is worth to watch this in the theater a couple of times. my rating :- 3.5/5",
         "This film is yet another awesome one from KV Anand.The songs and the bgm by HipHop Tamizha is bashing.It deserves a hearty applause.The first half of the film is a crisp entertainer.It also comes to be a revelation of various things inside the media and the politics played inside.It is indeed a 2 men show by Vijay sethupathy and TR.Jagan's role is also good. But the heroine could've been given a more prominent role as she seems like just a picture in a frame,ineffective.The story is amazing but the casting could've been even better.The second half seems to be slightly diluted and not moving in the same pace as it was in the first half.Bose venkat and Akashdeep saigal did justice to their roles and Pandiarajan is simply superb.Vikranth has just acted,nothing to say more.The dialogues are fantastic and the story indeed flows in the right speed much likable by the current generation. But cheers to the crew for their new approach and sure it would be an inspiration for the future films.I'm sure that it deserves to be seen in the theaters at least once and I'm sure that the audience come out satisfied with the thought that the film is worth a watch",
         "My review It's good movie script is a real hero and also a good editing and also power packed performance by all of them.even dialogues also have much content. TR comeback is awesome his performance is also very good and this movie shows the evils of media and engage audience with good entertainment Cons of the movie 1.Villains voice is not synced properly 2.the movie has logic flaws 3.songs are not good Overall it's good movie never miss out. please do watch it"
