         "content": "**The Blue's tale, a true free spirit.**\r\n\r\nThe return of the Red Dog. It has been five years since the first film. Who knew it, I never expected a film like that could get a sequel. That was inspired by a true event, but not this one. It was actually a prequel that tells the story of Red's earlier life, where did he come from, his owner et cetera. No one knows the real story, but after the 'Red Dog's success, seems they were desperate for the one more shot, hence this fictional account was born.\r\n\r\nNot as good as the first. In fact, no way anywhere near to that. All they did was to add all the possible ingredients to it to make it appeal everybody. So basically it looks like another 'Free Willy: Escape from Pirate's Cove'. With enough comedies, adventures, one Chinese guy, aboriginal legend, storm and obviously the sentiments that strike at the right time.\r\n\r\nFrom the same director and the writer, but not the dog. The original award winning dog, Koko, for the role Red had died after a year later the film got released. After hearing that, I got emotional as same as the film he had starred in. That was one of the best dog films ever and one of the best tearjerker as well. Then I wanted to see this one too, but I had knew it won't surpass the original. So I had to keep my expectations low for it.\r\n\r\nThis new guy called Phoenix was as good as Koko, but his role had a lesser scope. The effort/dedication/performance was the same, which is highly appreciable. Besides, he was very adorable. In fact, I felt hurt whenever he run alongside the motorbike. It might be natural, but I thought it was inhumane. I believe it was the multiple shots, not a single run. Coming to the story, it was told from a boy's perspective, his relation with the Red, but the original name was Blue.\r\n\r\n> ❝True blackness has a power all of its own. It doesn't just swallow light. It's like it swallows your soul.❞\r\n\r\nI did not like the opening scene. I thought it was very ordinary. So I guessed it's going to be a terrible film. But it did not take long to get back to the point. Once the flashback had started, it looked a different film. The entire narration was a recall. More a bedtime story. A father reveals to his son about the dog he'd lived with when he was at his age in the rural Australia in his grandfather's place. How he had found the dog and grew together, their friendship, mischiefs and other adventures. Then what happened later between them, all his life events with the Blue was told.\r\n\r\nAs I said, the screenplay was average, but the performances saved the film. The boy, the dog and all the co-stars were very good. The locations were even better. Just like the previous film, it was an ideal setting. The overall film was enjoyable, but the ending was very emotional. Having seen the first, anybody would have an idea what might come at the end, but not knowing how. I thought the same, but was not expecting the sentiments. The film ended with high. It also closed at where the original film had started, to make a perfect flow.\r\n\r\nOne thing I did not get was the unnecessary supernatural events. Yeah, I know the story sets in the Pilbara region, hence borrowed some local legend to stretch the storyline. But with the wildfire scene, it leans too much on that concept, making to slip away from the actual focus of the film. More than that, the film never clearly explained that segment.\r\n\r\nNow the real question is the story of Red/Blue ends here or can be expected more drag with a prequel and a sequel. First of all, I am not very happy with the fictional account. For that reason alone, it is not a must see. Because it could mislead the original film's die hard fans. So they should have given the statement at the opening that it was not based on the real. Other than that, it is a decent film in the 'Red Dog' series. Finally, I would say, it is a good film, but not the best.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",

         "Five years after Red Dog proved to be a smash hit at the Australian box office, the eponymous red kelpie is leaping back onto the silver screen, ready to win over holiday audiences once again in the sequel Red Dog: True Blue. Set immediately before the events of the first film, the story this time around is a coming of age story about a young boy who, after being sent to live with his grandfather in the West Australian outback, has a chance encounter with Red Dog that blossoms into a one of a kind friendship. Much like the first one, the film is a throwback to an old-fashioned type of family entertainment, before animal features involved CGI talking heads and loud and noisy special effects took front stage in lieu of genuine heart. It's only let down by its over eagerness to replicate what made the first film a big hit, that it often feels like it's lagging behind. It devotes a fair bit of the opening to replaying scenes from the first film, this time through the perspective of a middle-aged man sitting in a theatre watching the film with his children. We see his red, teary eyes glued to the screen, clearly touched by the story that has unfolded, which afterwards inspires him to recount his own childhood encounter with the dog. This meta moment feels a little bit like the sequel kissing its own butt for lack of a better expression. As a framing device, it's effective, but it can't shake off the shameless feeling that it's trying to coax audiences into remembering how teary they may have felt themselves after the first film, in case they forgot in the intervening years. It only sets up the sequel for failure as True Blue never manages to recreate this emotional punch, even when it desperately tries to turn on the waterworks once again towards the end. While this brings the film down a notch, wedged between these scenes is a film of comparable quality. It's light, breezy and frequently funny, with some mild third act drama, when a bush fire encroaches on the grandfather's cattle farm, adding some excitement to the affable proceedings. When a detour into Aboriginal mysticism threatens to veer into hokey territory, the film wisely strays away from any heavy-handed depictions, maintaining a light touch throughout. Verdict: Even though lightning doesn't exactly strike twice with True Blue, it still offers a solid piece of family entertainment that's replete with heart and a good-natured sense of humour, even if it won't win you over quite the same. 6.5/10",
         "Red Dog, one of the greatest Aussie movies of all time. It had everything, great story, tons of heart, characters you would hang out with in an instant, captured a time and place perfectly. Then there's this .. whatever it is. A complete and utter mess that I feel has and will rip people off. People who are expecting something of the original. Other than being set in Western Australia and having a dog in it, of a red tinge, there is nothing that is remotely similar to the original. The acting is of a standard that would barely pass an audition for a children's TV show. I mean Bryan Brown, come on. The 'Block of Wood' with eyes might have got you through in your 'Prime' such as that was or wasn't but the ad you recently did as a talking duck was better than this. At least we didn't have to see your constant and unwavering Grumpy Old Man face. The character development is fairly non existent, none of the characters are very likable, even the poor dog can't rise above the pedestrian directing. The story is told from the perspective of the 'original' owner of the Red Dog and is mostly one long, long, flashback. The film starts off in a shallow, clichéd fashion and never gets any better. The main Character, both present day older man and flashback younger version , is whiny and unlikeable. It's hard to feel anything for him. The supporting cast are a letdown, shallow and one dimensional, nothing like the bunch of loners, lovable rogues, and refugees from the world that made the first film so irresistible . The scenery is stark and portrays life in that part of the world fairly accurately, the soundtrack is a mix of great old Aussie tunes but doesn't fit well. It's almost like the soundtrack should be in a better movie. This movie was a massive disappointment, and should never have been released as anything to do with Red Dog.",
         "If your'e looking for a great story like the first red dog movie (which was absolutely great) then nope - nothing at all here.... just a story of some kid ( a story being told by the random father we know nothing about) with red dog before he became \"red dog\" The sad part was that i had huge hopes for this one after seeing how great the first Red Dog movie was years ago, but yeah the whole movie i'm expecting it to pick up but it never does,and then after the movie ended well yeah - nothing at all like the original red dog movie - more like a really boring pointless kid's version of the red dog movie without any of the elements that made the first red dog a great movie - like someone else said, the only good actor in the entire movie in my opinion was the actual red dog! - otherwise none of the other characters you really don't know about (or care about) to really enjoy the movie at all.... so yeah... for me, Most disappointing movie of 2016....lol",
         "I feel bad having to give only a five rating as the lead character was a young person who acted his heart out and did so well but the movie doesn't deserve a higher ranking. I would have enjoyed it ever so much more if it didn't have the feel of movie-making by numbers: we must have some homosexual characters, we must knock Christians (this time mission nuns), we must have mystical Aboriginals etc... political correctness will be the death of good story telling. There is nothing wrong with each of these individually but it felt contrived as if the director had to get them on screen somehow. And as much as I love stories about dogs I felt this one tried to milk that good will too much. The dog chasing the plane when the boy leaves, it was all too much. Maybe I would give it a higher rating if it hadn't been called Red Dog as it felt like a blatant cashing-in on that crazily enjoyable film. This wasn't a story about the dog it was a story about a boy becoming a man. Great scenery, great acting and great dog it just didn't come together as a good story.",
         "Just saw this tonight -- it was the opening film for this year's Berlin Berlinale. Went with my 8-yr. old daughter and two friends, one adult, one 14-yr. old, and we all enjoyed ourselves. It's a basic coming-of-age film -- not particularly out-of-the ordinary in terms of genre, but well-done, professional and very likable. Some good writing, good characters, beautiful Western Australian locations, and Phoenix -- the dog lead -- is just great. The film was recommended for 8 & up at the Berlinale, and I thought it worked well for my daughter. The film also hints at a few more thorny issues -- colonialism, abandonment, adult relations -- but also manages to keep the basic Boy meets Dog story at the center. For me it was a welcome relief to watch a good-quality live-action children's film, rather than another animated one.",
         "This prequel to Red Dog is a more personal story than the original hit film. While it is not as humorous as Red Dog, it is still an entertaining family film and well worth seeing. The movie primarily follows the story of a young boy named Mick in 1969, who is sent to a remote homestead in the Pilbara Region of Western Australia to stay with his Grandfather, while his mother is recovering in a facility. Mick, while dealing with the remoteness of the region; and the remoteness of his grandfather (wonderfully played by Bryan Brown), stumbles across a red puppy, initially covered in blue slime , after a major storm. The film charts their journey, often humorously, in becoming best friends. Being set primarily in 1969 the film is filled with wonderful characters that often reflect the changing times - A young recently returned Vietnam soldier, who sings and plays guitar except when the dog howls with him which, much to his disdain, is often! A pretty female teacher who wants to go to San Francisco and be part of 'The Summer of Love' , and there is a wonderful Chinese cook who always walks around with an umbrella! More interesting are the characters reflecting the changing times within the region and Australia in general - particularly an Aboriginal Jackaroo who sees a future for his people in Aboriginal land rights; And a scene where Lang Hangcock , a friend of Mick's Grandad, stops in and tells a young Mick how there is a future in Iron Ore in the region! For it is not only in the Australian landscape and lingo that the film reflects Australia, but also in the social changes that were happening within the country at the time that would have impacts on the Australian economy, Aboriginal people, women, and the changing landscape of Australian politics and the land. The film may pack too much in its short running time but it's worth seeing.",
         "A father takes his two young sons to see Red Dog. After the movie he describes to his oldest son how Red Dog is based on the story of a dog he had as a boy - Blue. From this we see the period in the man's childhood when Blue was his dog, their trials and tribulations living on a farm in a remote part of Western Australia. The first Red Dog was interesting, engaging and very emotional. This movie just seems like an attempt to cash in on the success of that movie. The story is quite lightweight and unengaging. Quite clumsy too, especially the segue from the father and sons watching the movie to it turning into a prequel to Red Dog. Even the adventures the boy and the dog go on seem very unexciting. While the original movie worked for both adults and children, this one was definitely made for kids, and kids only.",
         "Surely a more cynical film has never been made than this one. I didn't see \"Red Dog\" (1) but my wife raved about it. Having time to kill, I chose to see the \"prequel\". It was soon obvious that the film was a calculated tear-jerker. All the politically correct boxes were ticked, especially the Aboriginal sub-plots. The film is aimed at the pre-teen market. The inclusion of Lang Hancock as a crusty old lovably character must have been an attempt (successful?) to get some funding from his daughter, Gina Rinehart. I would rate this 1/10 but the photography deserves a point. Some talented actors were wasted in the production. Did they see the script before signing their contracts or are they really desperate for work?",
         "I adored the original Red Dog. It was Aussie, spirited, funny, genuine, human and just a great movie. It had a story to it. It WENT somewhere. It took the viewers on a journey. Red Dog Two, on the other hand, is a meandering set of images, snapshots and scenes that can be summarised as this: Boy leaves the city to live on an outback station. Boy meets a dog. Boy lives on the station. Boy goes back to the city. Of course, there are other events (meets a girl, gets involved in Aboriginal mysticism etc) but NO central narrative tying everything together. As a result, I felt cheated. The scenery and the careful framing of the movie in the sixties were the winners in this movie, but NOT the story. If you want Red Dog 2 to be similar to Red Dog 1, think again.",
         "An iconic Australian story of family, friendship and adventure, between a young boy and a scrappy one-of-a-kind dog that would grow up to become an Australian legend. Red Dog: True Blue is a sequel to the 2011 Red Dog film that was a big critical hit and i can see why of course. The film benefits from the strong bond between Levi Miller's Mick and Blue portrayed by Phoenix, their friendship is what makes this movie great plus Jason Isaacs doing the voice over was great as he was explaining his past to his son. What might turn off some viewers is the fact that the movie focuses more upon the kid rather than the dog like you should be expecting based on it's title and i wish that there was a tiny bit more drama and a bit less comedy but other than that? I can't find any more flaws i mean the movie is sad, fun and the performances from the entire cast are so sweet plus i love movies about dogs so if you love dogs too you will not be disappointed. (10/10)",
         "Australia's favorite dog is back and this time he has a background of where he came from! The most loyal and Australian dog has become a worldwide sensation and has made everyone around the world fall in love with him. A little boy named Mick (Levi Miller) has moved from Perth and into the outback with his Grandfather until he gets his life on track. Within a couple of days a storm hits and the next day after the storm he finds a little puppy covered in blue. He names him \"True Blue\" only to later discover he is a Red looking Dog. For a whole year they grow a friendship that could never be broken. Together we see the love they have for each other. All in all, this movie is just like the first one. It's like a refreshment or reminder of the dog we fell in love with. It offers nothing new nor nothing incredible. Acting wasn't that good, and it tries too hard on making Australian jokes that aren't really that funny. The only great actor in this was \"red Dog\" himself. By the time you get to the ending you see just how sad it is when best friends have to go away. But either way red Dog really was an inspiration to Australia and he's a great example of what a true friend really is. The Autistic Reviewers give this a 6/10. 2.5/5 stars. It's worth seeing. But if you haven't already check the first one out!",
         "This was a nice \"doggie\" story but fairly predictable and did not seem to relate much to the original story in the book. One question that comes to mind also is how much research did the film crew do on props? This was a period story set in the late sixties / early seventies. The cars and (e.g.) suitcases looked authentic, but what about the guitar that Stemple (the young stock man) was often seen playing? This looked to me like a modern Maton guitar! There are are hundreds of vintage Maton guitars out there, so why not use one from the correct period?. These days if you are going to make a period story set forty years ago, at least make a bit more effort with the props!",
         "The return of the Red Dog. It has been five years since the first film. Who knew it, I never expected a film like that could get a sequel. That was inspired by a true event, but not this one. It was actually a prequel that tells the story of Red's earlier life, where did he come from, his owner et cetera. No one knows the real story, but after the 'Red Dog's success, seems they were desperate for the one more shot, hence this fictional account was born. Not as good as the first. In fact, no way anywhere near to that. All they did was to add all the possible ingredients to it to make it appeal everybody. So basically it looks like another 'Free Willy: Escape from Pirate's Cove'. With enough comedies, adventures, one Chinese guy, aboriginal legend, storm and obviously the sentiments that strike at the right time. From the same director and the writer, but not the dog. The original award winning dog, Koko, for the role Red had died after a year later the film got released. After hearing that, I got emotional as same as the film he had starred in. That was one of the best dog films ever and one of the best tearjerker as well. Then I wanted to see this one too, but I had knew it won't surpass the original. So I had to keep my expectations low for it. This new guy called Phoenix was as good as Koko, but his role had a lesser scope. The effort/dedication/performance was the same, which is highly appreciable. Besides, he was very adorable. In fact, I felt hurt whenever he run alongside the motorbike. It might be natural, but I thought it was inhumane. I believe it was the multiple shots, not a single run. Coming to the story, it was told from a boy's perspective, his relation with the Red, but the original name was Blue. ❝True blackness has a power all of its own. It doesn't just swallow light. It's like it swallows your soul.❞ I did not like the opening scene. I thought it was very ordinary. So I guessed it's going to be a terrible film. But it did not take long to get back to the point. Once the flashback had started, it looked a different film. The entire narration was a recall. More a bedtime story. A father reveals to his son about the dog he'd lived with when he was at his age in the rural Australia in his grandfather's place. How he had found the dog and grew together, their friendship, mischiefs and other adventures. Then what happened later between them, all his life events with the Blue was told. As I said, the screenplay was average, but the performances saved the film. The boy, the dog and all the co-stars were very good. The locations were even better. Just like the previous film, it was an ideal setting. The overall film was enjoyable, but the ending was very emotional. Having seen the first, anybody would have an idea what might come at the end, but not knowing how. I thought the same, but was not expecting the sentiments. The film ended with high. It also closed at where the original film had started, to make a perfect flow. One thing I did not get was the unnecessary supernatural events. Yeah, I know the story sets in the Pilbara region, hence borrowed some local legend to stretch the storyline. But with the wildfire scene, it leans too much on that concept, making to slip away from the actual focus of the film. More than that, the film never clearly explained that segment. Now the real question is the story of Red/Blue ends here or can be expected more drag with a prequel and a sequel. First of all, I am not very happy with the fictional account. For that reason alone, it is not a must see. Because it could mislead the original film's die hard fans. So they should have given the statement at the opening that it was not based on the real. Other than that, it is a decent film in the 'Red Dog' series. Finally, I would say, it is a good film, but not the best. 7/10",
         "I felt the first movie was over-rated, or perhaps I just don't like a smelly dog being the center of the movie. In True Blue, the kid Mick Carter played by Levi Miller is the center of the movie, not the dog. I must prefer people to dogs, and Levi Miller is most amicable. The movie had a sub plot for me being the transient nature of youth. The opening scenes show a mature age Michael Carter (played by Jason Isaacs) reflecting on his youth and being sent to his grandfather property in the Pilbara. The closing credits feature the mature age Michael Carter again, with his sons & wife playing with a newly purchased pup. Therefore when we see Levi Miller in the movie, it is just a point in time, a memory, a pleasant memory at that."
