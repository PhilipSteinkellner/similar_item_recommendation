      "synopsis": "James Van Praagh (Ted Danson) is a fifty yeared-old man who has his own small business, insomnia at night and leads a lonely life. As his business is going badly, he needs to do something about it, and has the idea of creating the company's own website. He hires a successful professional web designer Midge Harmon (Queen Latiffah). She had been said by her psychic that she would meet somebody called James who has an ailing mother (Diane Ladd). James tells her that his mother is alright, although she's sick in hospital. Soon, James dreams with his dead grandmother (Bethoe Shirkoff) on his mother's side calling his mother. That night his mother dies and is buried with a rosary. James sees a strange woman from Idaho who gives him a nesttle of blue eggs. Midge gives an ouija board to James and she insists that he talk to her psychic, Adrian (Michael Moriarty). James tells recently-widowed woman, Mrs Ziff (Joy Coghill) that his husband (Bill Meilen) did not suffer a heart attack out of the blue. A police informant tried to steal his watch from him and he suffered a heart attack. James' business goes from bad to worst, as Frank, his business consultant (Hiro Kanagawa) advises him. While talking to his psychiatrist (Jay Brazeau) concerning having two sessions with him instead of one, James watches as a depressed woman (Jessica Schreier) in a rage ravages through the documents of the psychiatrist's office looking for something, and then takes a whole bottle of pills, committing suicide. James realises it was the psychiatrist's wife. He stops attending consultation with him. Detective Karen Condrin (Mary Steenburgen) finally visits the informant, and finds a gold watch belonging to the deceased mother. James advises Midge to stop smoking, or she'll die because of it. He also tells Midge of her grandmother (the strange woman who gave him the eggs)- Those eggs have something to do with a boy who James sees. James keeps on watching that boy, who had been buried alive. He learns that it's Dennis Branston (Neil Denis) who was buried alive in the middle of a turtle conservation park. James sees 5 boys more (Joel Palmer, Ben Johnson, Branden Nadon, Matthew Brevner, Jaren Brandt Bartlett). One of the boys, Andy (Reece Thompson) was a frande of James when he was a child (Connor Widdows). There are also images and scenes of a kidnapped boy. Somebody has written in one of the dishes that he'll see his mother soon and then gives him some drug or pill with his next meal. Allan Van Praagh (Jack Palance), James' father, advises his son to take some medicine so that he won't have more visions. James refuses. He'll try to help other people and tell the concerned people about his visions. Midge gets diagnosed with cancer and has to suffer the chemeotherapy. Midge wants to leave the chemeo because she says it's not working. James insists that she go on with the procedure. It is discovered that Dennis was the first person murdered of a gunshot, and that somebody brought him flowers every year. Later, he would kill a boy and bury in a circle around him. When the circle was finished, the murderer started another circle. They follow the clue of the buckets to the florist Linda (Linda Darlow), who says that, after years of secrecy and anonimosity, the man who bought the flowers finally appeared to buy a final bucket of flowers. The postman (David Makay) interrupts Linda, but she talks to Condrin. One of the killed boy's mother, Molly, thinks that his son is alive because she has been receiving flowers on mother's day, birthdays, etc... At a restaurant, he passes a message to a businessman whose dead brother tells him that it was not his fault he had killed him while hunting. The businessman Richard de Rochelly (Tim Henry) gets extremely upset and suffers a heart attack right there. James wants to forget about the boys, because he thinks he has found the man who killed the boys, so he freaks out when he has a vision of them. Later in the car, he tells his mother's ghost to go away. The kidnapped booy tries to run away but he is discovered. At hospital, Richard confesses that his brother Lester (Fred Henderson) killed the first boy by accident. Lester had only confessed that before to a Catholic priest (Lindsay Bourne). Lester brought flowers to the boy until he himself died. As James was brought up as a Catholic, Condrin asks him for help. James was adamant in leaving the case, but finally, he goes visiting the priest, who used to be a teacher of his. The priest is a tough person. While interviewing the priest, they hear the boy trying to get out. The priest says that there are rats in the basement. Afterwards, while having dinner with his father, James runs to hospital as Midge is about to die. Meanwhile, the boy breaks free from his prison but he has to go up a nosity staircase. His captor discovers him and imprisons him again. After the priest has left his church, Condrin goes back to the church on her own. Midge finally dies and James goes her funeral. James tells Adrian that he's decided to stop working as a psychic. Condrin goes down to the basement. Behind a green door, she can only find rats. A man smoking a pipe watches Condrin. The case looks cold, and somebody makes the suggestion that James may be the serial killer. James has another vision with the boys. Dennis shows him a photograph of his mother, and James - who feels like one of those tied and gagged boys - also sees hers. The link among the boys is that they have all lost their mothers, the same as James. Condrin starts acting as if she thought James is the killer. Somebody is burying the boy alive, but when they go to the reservation, there's nobody. James realises that the boy must have been buried in the cemetery, where Eddy's corpse lies now. Condrin starts thinking that James is the killer, but finally goes to the cemetery. James goes to the cemetery and Condrin follows a black car which is leaving the area. Condrin enters a home - after following the car - but nobody seems to be home. She goes down to the basement, where there is another green door (very similar to the one at the church basement's). There, she finds Eddie's mother, one of the killed boys, scrubbing the floor clean. She says: \"how terrible Eddie's friends are.\" At the police station, she says that Lester had confessed everything to her right before dying, and that she only wanted to bring friends for him to play on. When Lester confesses, she knew that his son was dead. Eddie talks to Molly through James so that she lets him and his friends leave. Molly breaks down and cries.",

         "I didn't expect much from that film. I was wrong. A man who can see the dead and talk with them is a risky subject. Besides, made for television movies dealing with supernatural events are often disappointing. Producers and directors seem to be afraid to scare audience in any way, and network self-censure doesn't improve that. \"Living With The Dead\" is a miraculous exception that could break the rule - if television gives us more like this. The actors are all excellent, with a special mention to Ted Danson, who probably gives here his finest performance. Mary Steenburgen is fine too, and both Jack Palance and Diane Ladd are too famous for I say how good they are. The screenplay is excellent, one of the best in TV's history. It alternates chilling and moving moments without any false note, using misdirection and red herrings with consummate skill. The whodunit is remarkably held and will let you guessing until the end. Characters are well-drawn, three-dimensional, not the puppets that one usually see in that kind of productions. A closer look reveals an intelligent reflection on death and how deal with it behind the thriller elements. And don't forget the most important thing: it REALLY SCARES. As I've said above, TV movies are rather weak on that. Not \"Living With The Dead\", that had me starting, shouting and shuddering more than once, without any gory effect. Kudos to the director. So if you like first-rate ghost stories, that one is a must-see for you. Don't miss it. Maybe the dead are behind you... Don't displease them!",
         "James Van Praagh (Ted Danson) is a weird man who sees and communicates with dead people since he was a child. After the death of his mother Regina Van Praagh (Diane Ladd), he resolves the murder of an old man, and Detective Karen Condrin (Mary Steenburgen) gets close to him. He starts investigating what happened to a dead boy, who insists to try to communicate with him. Later, James and Karen realize that many boys have been murdered and buried in an isolated forest for seven years. There are a few suspects and many mystery to be resolved. This thriller is excellent, having a very tight screenplay. The characters are well-developed, the cast has excellent names, including Queen Latifah and Jack Palance and the direction is good. The plot has drama, thriller, crime and suspense and hooks the attention of the viewer until the last scene. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): `Falando Com os Mortos' (`Talking With the Dead')",
         "\"Living With The Dead\" is an excellent and very compelling film. I am not a huge fan of horror films and I hated \"The Sixth Sense\" for some odd reason, anyway when I first saw this film advertised on CBS I promised myself that I would resist at all costs and watch \"Taxi Driver\" on DVD instead, but then this made for television film started and to my surprise I was totally involved with the story and felt a connection to the character of James (I don't see dead people, if that's what you're thinking). I sat there by the tv totally mesmerised by this spectacular story. The story, directing, dialoge, acting, and suspence are all top-notch. I really loved the performances in this mini-series, I thought every actor played his/her part perfectly, but there are two people that I was really impressed with, when I saw the previews I didn't expect much out of Queen Latifa because I never really considered her to be an \"actress\", but she was just excellent in this film, gave me a newfound respect for what she does. The other performance I was surprised by was given by Ted Danson. You see I have always thought of Danson as a comedic genius because of his work from \"Cheers\" and most recently \"Becker\", but I have never thought of him as a dramatic actor so I didn't expect much from him either, but once again I was taken by surprise as this man really became the character and played the part perfectly. He was extraordinary in this movie. Bottomline: It's a really great film that I hope to see again sometime. Final-Grade: 8/10",
         "I have to admit I didn't have much faith in Ted Denson- he usually plays in comedies, and this movie is a drama. But after watching this movie, I have to beg for forgiveness for my lack of faith. :-) Denson was excellent and I was very impressed. The same can be said about Queen Latifah. They made me feel their fear, confusion, happiness etc. The plot was very good. I was in suspense the whole movie. Great direction, too. I loved the whole aura of the movie- dark and mysterious, spooky and creepy at times. It managed to be a suspense/horror movie, without being a standard horror movie. I mean, they don't show blood or disgusting things like in \"Scream\" (for example), but psychologically horror, like \"The sixth sense\". Hope you got my drift... :-) Bottom line: this movie was great, I really enjoyed everything about it: acting, script, photography, direction, plot...everything. If you have the chance to watch it- watch it. I think you'll enjoy it... Have fun!!!",
         "I've accidentally found this movie on the Hallmark channel as there's no better choice on HBO and other movie channels that night. Without knowing anything about this movie I started watching it, and thinking that it might be just another horror movie. I must admit that I was kinda disappointed while I saw Ted Danson appeared on the movie cos I never really like Cheers and neither do I interested on any of his movie at all. But now, I must say Thank God I didn't switch to other channel which I almost did that night. This is an excellent movie with great actors, the performance of Ted Danson, Queen Latifah and Jack Palance impressed me a lot, and other actors were amazing in their roles too. I was stupid to ignore Ted Danson's movie in the past, he is really a great actor that acted with his heart and soul. This is not just a horror movie but a movie about forgiveness , understanding and most of all - LOVE! I love this movie very much, so much so that I watched the repeat again the next morning.",
         "This fine two-part TV movie held my interest from beginning to end and was even more exciting than \"The Sixth Sense,\" which covered somewhat similar subject matter. Ted Danson was very good as a man who could see the dead and had a difficult time coping with this unwanted gift. People used to seeing him in \"Cheers\" and \"Becker\" will be impressed that he is equally effective in a dramatic role. Mary Steenbergen and other cast members were also very good in their roles. The biggest praise must go the the writers for producing a script that never let the viewer get bored or restless. The fact that this movie is based on a real person and a true story somehow makes life better for me.",
         "I happened upon this little gem as I was channel surfing. An excellent story line with some commonality with other stories but still unique in its own way. The characters were well done, as were the special effects. Additionally, the special effects weren't the star of the show - the story was. The special effects were used sparingly and effectively, supporting and extending the story line. The dank, grey ambience of Vancouver in the rainy season (think \"Millennium\") matched the circumstances of the lead character's life at the time (a failing business and a recently deceased mother) beautifully. Danson's honest portrayal of a troubled man with a newly discovered and troubling \"gift\" (his clairvoyance) were very, very well done. I have to admit that I never cared much for Danson's breadth of emotion, but this series converted me. Sorry, Ted and thanks, Ted! Well done! A coup for all!",
         "This film is kind of like \"Sixth Sense\" (he sees dead people) only, in my opinion, a fair amount better. The guy is on one hand trying to help a detective solve a series of murders but also cope with his new found \"talent\" along with other personal troubles. Thoroughly watchable, I found myself eager for the adverts to end and get back to the excitement. It ends well and will surprise you.",
         "I have just finished watching the first part of Living With the Dead. I would ordinarily never even think of writing a review until I had finished watching a movie until the credits stop rolling. Yet this film is the exception to the rule. Not since Lonesome Dove has there been a multi-part television endeavor that I actually have been excited about seeing the finish. Until now. Ted Danson gives one of the best performances of his career. Portraying the guilt ridden Catholic and stodgy bibliophile forced into facing things he doesn't want to face in a very believable and empathetic way. The rest of the cast is equal quality. Stephen Gyllenhaal's direction is deft and workmanlike. Throw in Jeffery Jur's top notch and sufficiently creepy Cinematography and you got yourself a very worthwhile movie, made for television or not. I have now waited a week to see the finish. I stand by my previously conclusions. While the story itself is unexceptional, the dialogue is good. Whether or not the story is true or the movie is like the book is immaterial to the quality and enjoyment for me. I watched it on CBS and even though it was interrupted with an unseemly amount of commercials and my advice is watch it uninterrupted if you can, I still enjoyed it. All-in-all, a very worthwhile movie to watch. I give it 8 stars out of 10.",
         "LIVING WITH THE DEAD, in my opinion, is an excellent supernatural thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It really kept me on the edge of my seat. I thought that Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen gave smashing performances. If you ask me, LIVING WITH THE DEAD has it all. Mainly, it has suspense. However, in my opinion, this film was put together flawlessly. When the spirits showed up, that was my favorite part. It was my favorite part for many reasons. If this ever comes to DVD, I would really love to buy it. I'd like to close by saying, \"Parents, if you have young children, do not subject them to this film. They will get scared.\"",
         "I watch TV and don't care how much of it ends. If I fall asleep, it doesn't disturb me that I don't know what happened. When \"Living with the Dead\" was on one Sunday with Part Two the next Sunday, I couldn't wait to see it, I even waited until 11 pm to drive about 4 hours (there & back) to take some children in the family home to their mother! (they didn't have to watch the movie, too young) And I had to get up for work at 7 am at the latest!! I thought the story and acting were compelling, I felt the story line could be possibly true, I was never sure who was doing the murders until nearly the very end. Of course, such subject matter isn't for everyone, but in the 21st century, it's on more people's minds than ever. The very best part of the film is when Diane Ladd says \"Not Everyone\" when Ted Danson asks her if death is peaceful for everyone...whew! This film is underrated. It really held my interest and I was recommending it, even to people who missed Part One.",
         "This film was the best movie I have ever seen with Ted Danson in it. It is now on of my favorite tv movies and is highly recommended. When it first came out alot of people thought it would be really scary but it wasnt that scary and had a good ending! I cannot tell you what the ending was but if you would like to know find out! Way to go Ted !",
         "Talking to Heaven aka Living with the Dead is based on the book by James van Praagh, one of America's most famous mediums. He is also the main character, played by Ted Danson. The movie features the story of James' ability to connect with dead people and traces his supernatural gift back to his childhood. Now he is in his forties. When his mother (Diane Ladd) dies everything comes back and his abilities grow stronger. Mysterious things start to happen, dead boys haunt James and want him to do something. James is baffled and starts investigating with the help of detective Karen Condrin (Mary Steenburgen). While they come across a 30-year-old murder case involving seven young boys, James delves deeper into the mysteries and finds evidence of a connection to his own past. But their time is running out and the life of another boy (Reece Thompson) is on the line. The story is very complex and sophisticated. You never stop making your own assumptions and the numerous subtle hints and connections between times and places give the story tremendous strength and add substantial quality to the plot. I have seen many mystery movies and thrillers, but hardly any is able to match the suspense and the complexity of Talking to Heaven. Despite its length of almost three hours and due to the wonderfully paced unraveling of mysteries and the ability of Ted Denson in particular to maintain the level of suspense, the story keeps the audience alert and never becomes slow or corny. There are so many connections and hints, so many scenes that are simply awesome and so many sub-plots with underlying themes and messages that Talking to Heaven can be called a revelation and a stunning mystery masterpiece. The strongest aspect of the story is the link between the murder of the boys and James' own past. This makes him emotionally very much attached to the crime story and is perfectly connected to the introductory sequences that feature him as a boy. Everything is a puzzle at the outset and there is never a point in the course of the story where you could predict what is going to happen next. Very few movies achieve this level of unpredictability. James' life and his struggles make up a significant part of the story, especially his relationship and his ensuing contact with his late mother. She provides some sort of guidance for him and makes him understand the issue of death and accept his gift as a blessing rather than a curse. The relationships with his father (veteran Jack Palance) and his friend Midge (Queen Latifah) have no immediate connection to the crime story, but provide substantial depth for understanding him as a character. The many scenes in which James talks to strangers about their late relatives collaborates to get a sense of his abilities and the mysteries of his life. The murder case is the core of the story, its major strength and the main source of suspense. Even without the mystery aspect, this would make an awesome thriller. Mary Steenburgen as detective Condrin acts as a kind of buffer between the supernatural background story and the terrific real-life murder case and helps to combine the strengths of both. There are many pieces that need to be collected, many assumptions that need to be made and many secrets that need to be unraveled. A major sub-theme is the story of Eddie Kats (James Kirk) and his mother. Their paths are a significant part of the story and add another very sophisticated emotional level. The scenes that feature Eddie and James reminded me very much of thematic elements that pervade the writings of Stephen King, who makes strong use of these cross-time stories that appeal emotionally and make you think about values and life in general. A similar pattern surfaces in the story of Reece Thompson's character, who is terrorized and trying to escape death. Both boys (Thompson and Kirk) are perfectly cast and deliver superb performances \u0096 though they appear on entirely different settings. They shine and add authenticity to the story, in particular on an emotional level. Talking to Heaven is a combination of different genres. It features a complex and outstandingly sophisticated storyline, awesome actors and so many sub-themes that culminate in an entirely stunning and satisfying climax that leaves you at the edge of your seat. The final denouement connects with all the layers of setting, both time and place, and by then you realize the complexity and quality of the story. A brilliant mystery masterpiece by all means.",
         "I just saw this movie for the first time and I thought it was excellent. The acting was superb, the script was very well written. Top Movie! Some very emotional scenes I cried like a baby. It makes you believe!",
         "Very good movie with excellent actors. This is a really freaky subject but I liked it. Sometimes we Earth bound people need movies like this to just give us a clue! I hope others see this movie as such and not just a form of entertainment.",
         "There are at least 15 out of 16 \"AMAZING, GREAT, SUPERB,...\" comments on this movie, but you chose to put the only one that sais BORING on the user comment line. What's going on? Is IMDB getting boring? Plase... this is a fantastic movie with a great RATE, so remove the BORING line. THANX! line6 line7 line8 line9 line10 OK :)",
         "A \"Spoiler\" for those who don't know is a scene that comes up before it is meant to in order to keep the audience interested. These spoilers showed up before every commercial break thus ruining the show for me. This is just like someone in a movie theater who saw the movie before talking out loud as to what will happen. I watched this mini-series for about 45 minutes and gave up on what looked like a good story thanks to the spoilers. It is no wonder that fewer and fewer people are watching network tv. This is the last time I watch any TV-movie or min-series on CBS.",
         "Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen, Michael Moriarty, Queen Latifah, Diane Ladd and Jack Palance were perfect in their respected roles in Living With the Dead. For a made for TV film, this was definitely over achieving expectations. Mrs. Shullivan and I really enjoy a good suspense film, but eh, throw in some great science-fiction, thriller, and a non-stop \"who done it\" serial killer theme and you come up with in my opinion a prime-time Emmy winner for any film audience. Ted Danson is the star of this film who plays James Van Praagh, a troubled divorced man whose business is struggling financially, his elderly mother Regina Van Praagh played by Diane Ladd has just been admitted into the emergency wing of the local hospital after suffering a stroke, but James Van Praagh also has demons deep inside his mind from his early childhood memories of seeing and talking to dead people. Jack Palance plays Ted Danson's father Allan Van Praagh, who continually tells his young son well into his adulthood years that he must suppress any visions that his son James might be seeing and disregard them as nonsense. But the young James Van Praagh remembers vividly his mother relying on a composite of drugs to survive and when he is an adult his father tells James that he can arrange for him to receive the same drugs that his mother used to help her sleep. At this point James realizes that his mother must have also had visions of dead people herself, and she was trying to suppress them. Queen Latifah plays a business consultant named Midge Harmon who is called in to help save James faltering business, but she also tries to help James see that both his past and future visions are real so she brings him to a meeting of like minded people where James is introduced to a very calm Psychic named Adrian played by Michael Moriarty. Adrian patiently tries to reassure James that his visions are real and that eventually when he is ready to accept that his uncanny ability to speak to the dead is very real, he will be at peace with himself, and be able to assist people talk to their dead relatives through him. The film moves along at a very even pace maintaining the suspense as James continues to interact with many dead people and a slew of young boys who are trying to instruct James how he can assist in finding their serial killer. There are a number of potential serial killer suspects and you will find yourself questioning who the real murderer is. This is by far a much better suspense film than is generally available on television, and since Mrs. Shullivan and I just watched the film 14 years after it was originally released and it still has great appeal I can recommend to other viewers that it is well worth your evening's entertainment and you will not be disappointed. I give the film a solid 8 out of 10 rating.",
         "Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen star in \"Living with the Dead,\" a 2002 Hallmark film based on the book by James van Praagh,\"Talking to Heaven.\" The film also stars Queen Latifah, Michael Moriarity, and Jack Palance. I am interested in spiritual phenomenon, but I'll be honest and say that I've never been a particular fan of James van Praagh. I can't even really tell you why, I just never found him particularly authentic. I'm guessing that van Praagh's book is non-fiction regarding the early life of the main character but that the adult part is fiction. I could be wrong; I don't know that much about his life. In the movie, van Praagh realizes his psychic abilities early on and is encouraged by his mother not to discuss them (and as it turns out, his mother had the same ability). Therefore, he grows up to find his abilities an annoyance. When young boys who are deceased start to appear to him, ask for help, and try to give him a message, his life becomes nearly unlivable. A police detective (Steenburgen) believes him and works with him on the case -- one of the boys had disappeared some 30 years earlier. I found this movie scary, suspenseful, spiritual, and very well acted by all involved. It has a very slow buildup -- it's in two parts - and as the years go on, we become less and less used to stories that have the art of the buildup. However, I urge you to stick with it. There has been a proliferation of this type of material since 1999's \"The Sixth Sense\" both in films and on television. I think this is one of the better ones.",
         "This was a good TV movie. It's based on a 'ture' story, but if you believe that or not doesn't really matter. The story is slow paced and well told. The actors are fantastic in all the roles. Danson's turn from comic to dramatic acting was great... you'd forget all about Sam & Becker... he IS James Van Praagh. This movie is a lot more like Stir of Ecos as poised to the 6th sense... as it deals with an adults attempts to tackle his 'gift' and control his 'visions'. I'd recommend you see it if you can. Enjoy the show!",
         "I'd had this movie recommended to me by a friend, but didn't have a lot of faith in Ted Dansen's ability to carry a role such as this. I can say, however, that I was not only pleased, but astounded by his performance. His reactions to his character's abilities were played on a pitch-perfect note. I can't imagine living inside the head of anyone who could actually \"see dead people\" but Danson's portrayal rang true for me. I can imagine being just as \"freaked out,\" scared out of my mind, and wondering if I were indeed insane. It's a wonderful and terrible burden, I'm sure, if true. And even if Van Praagh doesn't have the abilities as described, this made-for-TV movie was one of the best I've ever seen. The pacing was excellent, the dialog believable, and the characters and their interrelationships well-developed - and it was also a great, old-fashioned creepy \"whodunit,\" good enough to keep most folks fooled until the very end. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who not only likes a good story of the supernatural, but anyone who likes a good, old-fashioned murder mystery.",
         "I am not a big Ted Danson fan, no I was not into the \"Cheers\" thing. In fact I just saw this last night (1/29/2006) due to it was the most interesting show on TV. Well, I have to admit, this show is really an edge of the seat show! It does start off a bit slower setting up Mr. Danson's character, but when it takes off you'd better hold on!! It is seldom that the wife and I actively try to guess the end of a show as I usually tell her what's going to happen next, but we were chatting like magpies trying to guess the next scene and who done it..... I'm not telling.... see for yourself! This show should have been award material!",
         "Its a must see movie. Its story is great,acting is great and once you watch it you'll like to watch it again like i do .When i first saw it i missed its name but just saw a flash of it which read the word heaven. I tried searching for it over the web again and again when one day google brought me here and i found it. In my country when i asked about this movie they told me that a movie with this name doesn't exist but once i found the poster of it on the web i showed it to all my friends who didn't believe me and finally they believed me.This movie is on number 2 from the most popular movies i have ever searched. The first one was taken By Harry Potter but i must say its a great movie.You cant know what the end will be.. unless you see it.. BTW i first watched it on Hallmark.Which i would like to thank them to showing such a great movie to me.. Thank you Hallmark ..",
         "It seems that there are several shows using the after death theme lately. In a culture that doesn't talk much about death this may help people become more open minded and comfortable with death. I like movies with real life husband and wife actors performing in a film. This movie kept my attention throughout even though at times it did drag a bit. It was interesting seeing Queen Latifa act without being funny. I am most moved by the ending of the movie. I didn't see it coming and that is refreshing. More importantly, the message of forgiveness and love in such a spiritually profound, visual and moving manner was very unique. I am grateful that I chanced upon it. There are no accidents only experiences."
