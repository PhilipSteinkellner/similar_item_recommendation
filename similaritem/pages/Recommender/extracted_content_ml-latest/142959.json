         "i've already watched this masterpiece over more than ten times, each time i am destined to be more appalled by its fine and delicate structure and distinctive directing style than last time, it tells a story about a bunch of superficially disconnected couple who are,were or will be experiencing their turning crossroads of lifetime, but with the help of surroundings,inner self,and willpower.they managed to hurdle those obstacles and avoid debacle in time. i especially enjoy the final episode which depicts a lost lovebird who can't find her way back to her newly-met boyfriend when facing a host of buildings,a picturesque resemblance of lost in translation. above all, it's certainly a touching and melting flick for every generation and gender",
         "What a charming film 'Spicy Love Soup' is! I especially enjoyed the story about a bored young married couple who rebuilt their tarnished relationship with remote control toy cars that they got on the wife's birthday. By playing with lots of different kids' toys together, they started communicating again and rediscovered their love. Different people may find different episodes they can relate to in this modern Chinese film. The well construction, good acting, and humorous conversation immediately take you into the film. 'Spicy Love Soup' will give a lot of spices into your heart for sure.",
         "Mostly factual description of the up and downs of love and romance, and the different experience and different views of love and romance between different people, including people of different generations. Great symbology of using the Yin-Yang and Spicy and Sour Soup, could not be accurate."
