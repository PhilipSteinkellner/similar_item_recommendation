         "This is a fine romp of a movie, full of interesting plot twists and developments, and not too heavy on mindless violence. The politics of the story are a timely warning against the military industrial complex that would destroy democracy for its own greed. The true hero is the one who abides by human values rather than accepting the blind authoritarianism so common in right-wing zealotry. Jon Voight superbly skewers this insanity masquerading as patriotism in his performance. Jill Hennessy provides adept detective work in uncovering the conspirators heinous plot. A very enjoyable adventure.",
         "Definitely worth the price of the rental! I can't believe I never saw this movie before. It was action packed, gripping, THrilling, No Love scenes and John Voight was masterful in his part. I hated him in this movie, and wanted to see him in pain, Which means the acting works! Rent this movie and let me know what you think. I didn't think it was as hilarious as the last commenter but it some funny parts.Keenan was also a great asset to thismovie. I've seen him in 1 other movie like this and he was good in that as well. I Don't understand why he doesn't do more movies. Jill Hennesy, although GREAT in \"Crossing Jordan\" didn't really impress me. Maybe this is her first movie. I expected a little more from her. This Movie wasn't your typical \"ARNOLD\" or \"BRUCE WILLIS\" movie with the corny one liners. This was much better thought out. When a comment was made after some sort of action theme, the lines were actually funny.",
         "The film talks about a marine (Keenen Ivory Wayans) condemned on death row but he breaks out and is recruited by a shadowy U.S. military General (John Voight) forming a group of secret operations . The objective is to kill murderers and delinquents and acting as judge , jury and executer , preventing traditional law enforcement . However , in his first mission happens death of the First Lady and the events led to him . All the forces , Cia (deputies : Paul Sorvino and Eric Roberts) , Military Forces (Voight , Eddie Velez) and Police are looking for him and he is attacked and pursued from both sides , making desperate attempts to escape and even going into a highway with cars driving in fast speed at some breathtaking scenes . Film captures the special excitement of the protagonist for the continuous pursuits and he can see no way out , being only helped by a beautiful woman (Jill Henessy) , killing's witness . As the protagonist becomes from most honored to Most Wanted . Sometimes the most patriotic thing a Marine can do , is disobey orders . Picture has maximum suspense , thrills , emotion and tension from the subsequents attempts of starring to get away and resolve the enigma about the assassination . Film is exciting and tense , besides is plenty of noisy action , violence , shootouts , at time brilliant luster and big budget . Although is a standard actioner is fast movement with atmospheric action set pieces and extremely entertained and amused . Keenen Ivory Wayans (Scary movie, Glimmer man) is a stunningly action hero . Jill Henessy (Crossing Jordan) is enjoyable and attractive . Special mention to John Voight (Deliverance, Midnight Cowboy , Pearl Harbour) as a crazed and evil General in a sensationalistic and overblown interpretation . The movie was rightly directed by David Hogan (better than ¨Barbwire¨ film). The flick will appeal to action movies fans .",
         "Keenen Ivory Wayans plays a marine on the run after he is framed for the murder of the First Lady. It's watchable and the cast is good, but there's absolutely nothing that you can't predict. A good premise that needed a sharper script. Voight steals the show as a corrupt general. 2/4",
         "This movie is not one of those Huge titles but it is a huge movie. Edge of the seat excitement that just keeps going. Hard to get a breath during this film. Special effects are pretty good with characters you'll love to hate. The best part is it keeps twisting and turning right to the end as a matter of fact it screams sequel just to finish it off but it probably didn't make enough people care WOW I Loved it!!!",
         "This is one of the most entertaining action films I've seen in a long time. It was hilarious. I don't think there was one moment of the film that the viewer could take seriously, and I'm not really sure whether this was intentional or not. Either way, this film is hilarious. I've seen straight-up comedies that weren't as funny as this film. Throughout the '80s, we saw a trend toward more and more outrageous action films. The Die Hard series really pushed the limits of the suspension of disbelief, and that trend continued with a number of other films. Most Wanted is a continuation of this trend, perhaps the culmination of it. If you pay money to rent this and expect to see a serious action/conspiracy film, you're in for a big disappointment, because that's not what this movie's about. It's about hyperbole, and that's what makes it entertaining. You can't help but laugh at it. Jon Voight is fantastic in his role as the cruel general. If I were going to cast someone in an over-the-top role, I'd have to choose Voight. I enjoyed him in Anaconda, and I enjoyed his performance in this film. If you want to see a hilarious action/adventure romp, rent Most Wanted. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",
         "Enjoyable movie by today's standards. It used some technology that was exploited one year later in another movie called \"Enemy of the State\". More than one subplot came together nicely at the end. Contains mystery and suspense interspersed with action. Not being overly critical, I found only one sentence that I would have changed with different words. A seldom seen movie, this little gem has a few surprises that can keep one's interest to the finale.",
         "Keenan Ivory Wayans! Jon Voight! Action! Thriller! Suspense! Yawn... Well, I can't say it's a bad movie, it's just not a good one. Basically, it's Mr. Wayans in the tried, tired, and true role of The Honest Soldier Being Framed By an Evil Army Official. If it wasn't so formulmatic, it'd be a lot more enjoyable. Alas, the movie does nothing to establish it's own identity separate from other similar films. The acting is suspect in parts and some of the one-liners make you cringe. Jon Voigt is the only actor who seems remotely believeable, but even his acting seems a bit forced in parts. Final Analysis: I wouldn't rent it, but if you're not doing anything else and you come across it on the TV, it might be a good guilty pleasure.",
         "This movie has probably had the harshest criticism of any action movie. It is rarely shown on television. This movie is at the top of my guilty pleasures. It has all the elements of a good Keenen Ivory Wayans flick. I remember watching this film a bunch of times when i was younger, and I been meaning to watch it again but I forgot the title so i spent years and years searching for this movie, until i caught it on cinemax a few months ago. The plot: military convict named James Dunn (Wayans) who is recruited from death row to serve in an elite CIA black squad group. The convict is framed for the murder of the First Lady of the United States, a murder he didn't commit. He escapes with his life, then seeks to find the real killer and bring them to justice. This film also stars Jon Voight as a corrupt general with a southern accent and it seemed like he was really into his role, and Jill Hennessy as the unlikely sidekick she doesn't really do much and her character isn't well developed. the acting was quite good, the action sequences were well done and intense. also a few funny scenes. Very interesting watching Keenen Ivory Wayans In a serious role. I recommend this movie it's not perfect but it's worth a watch.",
         "Hilary Rodham Clinton probably will skip \"Barb Wire\" director David Glenn Hogan's action epic \"Most Wanted,\" a clever but contrived conspiracy thriller about the assassination of a fictitious First Lady. Wayans plays rogue Marine Gunnery Sergeant James Anthony Dunn whose own superior officer frames him for gunning the first lady down. Actress Jill Hennessey appears as Dr. Victoria Constantini, a Zapruder style eye witness who videotapes the real assassins that shot the President's wife. Before long Constantini finds herself on the lam with Dunn. Despite its clearly imitative nature and its wholly disposable plot, \"Most Wanted\" contains enough okay action scenes to make the grade. Nevertheless, this standard issue shoot'em up is definitely not the best work of actor/writer Keenen Ivory Wayans. He was more fun in his 1994 action comedy \"Low Down Dirty Shame\" with Jada Pinkett. Not only does Wayans star in \"Most Wanted,\" but he also penned the screenplay. Wayans cobbles together scenes from every major action flick to create his own film. Shrewdly, he forges a plot around a string of surefire movie scenes that he has rewritten carefully. In the opening scene, Sgt. Dunn refuses to shoot an innocent shepherd boy during Operation Desert Storm. Sgt. Dunn's Commanding Officer threatens to shoot him on site for disobeying an order. They struggle. During the struggle, the officer's gun discharges accidentally and the officer dies from a gunshot wound. Dunn receives the death sentence for murder. During his bus ride to Fort Leavenworth, Dunn is rescued by a super secret anti-terrorist military unit. An evil, redneck Gen. Adam Woodward, alias Lt. Col. Grant Casey (Jon Voight of \"Midnight Cowboy\") gives Dunn the option to either join his group or die. Reluctantly, Dunn agrees to join and finds himself the designated hitter in an assassination attempt. The unit has targeted shady biochemical mogul Donald Bickhart (Robert Culp of \"Hickey and Boggs). At the VA Hospital where Bickhart is greeting the First Lady, Dunn is set up. Gen. Woodward's henchmen kill the First Lady and frame him. Now, the Los Angeles Police Department as well as Woodward's gunmen pursue Dunn. Our wrongly accused hero spends the rest of the movie trying to exonerate himself. The filmmakers pad the action out with a superfluous subplot involving the Central Intelligence Agency. C.I.A. Deputy Director Kenny Rackmill (Paul Sorvino of \"Goodfellas\") smells a cover-up. He is suspicious because Dunn's description as the assassin was confirmed far too quickly. Dunn calls in the agency, but the C.I.A. refuses to help him until he can find scoop some poop on Gen. Woodward. Meanwhile, Constantini doesn't totally believe Dunn, even after he saves her life from a bomb planted in her house. Director David Glenn Hogan and Wayans have crafted a Kennedy style conspiracy thriller. The heroic sergeant that Wayans plays is the classic loner with either no family or no friends. He qualifies as the ideal choice for the assassin as well as the fall guy. The first scene borrows from the Sylvester Stallone shoot'em up \"The Specialist\" (1994)\" with Sharon Stone. The bus escape scene is straight out of Brett Ratner's \"Money Talks\" with Chris Tucker. The ebony and ivory combo of an African-American hero and a white heroine recalls the chaste \"Pelican Brief\" with Denzel Washington and Julia Roberts. Like \"The Pelican Brief,\" Wayans and Hennessy never get the hots for each other and play hide the salami. \"Most Wanted\" has a prefabricated, trace-the-numbers storyline that leaves little doubt about where the action is leading the characters. There are some really dumb scenes, too. After the authorities have identified Dunn, he strolls into a public library to use a computer. The Dunn character wanders through half of the action without a disguise. In the most original scene, half of L.A. chases Dunn onto a freeway in a Frank Capra like foot chase. Sadly, Keenen Ivory Wayans wants to become the black equivalent of Stallone's Rambo character. He makes a suitable, straight-forward hero, but he's far too dull. Mario Van Peebles would have been a better choice for Dunn. Wayans plays a squeaky clean hero. The reverse occurs when the antagonists are involved. Enjoying a villainous career comeback since \"Mission Impossible,\" Jon Voight conjures up a full-blown portrait of evil. As Gen. Woodward, Voight is a ruthless adversary. Paul Sorvino lends his considerable screen presence as the spy chief to the C.I.A. subplot as does Eric Roberts as his aide. \"Most Wanted\" squanders both Sorvino and Roberts. \"Miami Vice\" supporting actor John Diehl shows up in yet another cameo as a police captain. Luscious actress Jill Hennessy is sexy enough, but she never really proves herself either as a heroine or a hot date. \"Most Wanted\" emerges as brisk, harmless action fodder. Don't dwell on its improbable plot if you want to enjoy it for the mindless fodder that it is. Just sit back and get a kick out of its adrenalin antics. The pizza scene is hilarious and the dialogue on the prison bus is a hoot! Wayans appears to have had the most fun writing in the scene where dozens of blacks with shaven heads crowd the scenes. Another funny moment occurs when a guard mistakes Dunn for another talk-show host and asks for his autograph. \"Most Wanted\" plays it safe, confining itself to familiar territory, doing exactly what you expect for a thriller of its caliber, and delivering the usual quota of thrills, chills, and spills without offense of any kind. Composer Paul Buckmaster endorses the action with a flavorful musical score, and \"Set It Off\" lenser Marc Reshovky's murky photography captures the element of paranoia that suffuses this saga."
