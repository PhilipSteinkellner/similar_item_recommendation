         "This is the classical retelling of the charming fairytale the princess and the pea, the story of a pretty young girl who arrives at a castle claiming to be a princess. The prince falls in love with her at once, but his cautious parents decide to test her to see if she is a real princess by putting a pea beneath twenty mattresses she must sleep on. This film focuses mainly upon the handsome young prince, who, just after the arrival of the self-proclaimed princess, sets off on a quest to find a real princess to marry. During his quest he encounters a foolish, superficial princess, a princess who challenges her poor suitors with an impossible riddle to get rid of them and a princess devoted to art. Returning home empty-handed and broken-hearted, the prince realizes a real princess has been under his nose all along in the form of the young girl who arrived on his doorstep. Beautiful scenery, a wonderful storyline and great acting combine to make an enchanting film that I highly recommend for those who love a good fairytale.",
         "The movie uses the Princess and the Pea story as a frame to introduce three more classical tales from Andersen. While the bedraggled princess keeps company to the King and the Queen, the Prince travels in search of a wife, and we have the story about the Princess and the Swineherd, The Princess and the Troll, and another one with a princess looking for the most sophisticated and talented suitor of all. Some endings to the stories are altered from Andersen's, though. Although the cast includes some of the top Soviet actors (Freindlich, Smoktunovsky, Kalyagin, Kvasha), they play small parts, while the Prince himself is lacking any substantial charisma and cannot carry the film. The entire flick somehow feels awkward, it lacks momentum and doesn't draw you in as best fairytale films do. For the soundtrack, they use Vivaldi's music, and it's a great idea. The music is probably one of the best elements in the film which says something about its quality. A tepid and mediocre retelling of four Andersen's stories.",
         "In this version of the Princess and the Pea, a young girl shows up at the castle gates in the middle of a storm, claiming to be a princess and asking for shelter. The next morning the prince of said castle rides out to find a princess to take to wife. Searching far and wide, each princess he finds falls short of his ideal one way or another until he finds just what he was looking for in the last place he expected. While I love the story of the princess and the pea, I found the movie to be surreal and almost stilted. The acting, while not atrocious, seemed to be lacking. I most definitely would not recommend this film to anyone who is not a fan of the story. But for those who are it makes for a pleasant hour and a half. Just don't pay too much to see it."
