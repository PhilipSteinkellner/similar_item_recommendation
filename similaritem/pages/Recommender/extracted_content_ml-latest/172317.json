         "I saw this movie advertised a couple of years ago as \"Heber Holiday\" but never saw it in theaters. I was waiting for it to come out on DVD so I could watch it on Netflix. I finally found it on Netflix, but under a different name, \"Shooting Star\". The script was atrocious. It felt like dialogue was delivered just to advance the plot, even if it didn't fit in the scene at all. The characters weren't developed. Sierra was not properly established as a diva. Plus, Torrey Devitto isn't a very good actress. It was not believable that she could demand $10 million a film. Except for KC Clyde and Erin Chambers the acting by the rest of the cast was horrible. I couldn't tell if this movie was trying to be serious or intentionally cheesy. The characters of Scott and Hound were way over-the-top, which may have been fine in a spoof, but not in a serious film, as I think this film attempted to be. A lot of the music was out of place and poorly edited. At one point, the camera changed to a wavy style for no reason, that almost made me seasick. This is one of the worst LDS-made films I have seen. It's no wonder it didn't make it out of Provo.",
         "I just barely watched this film and have to say it was laughable at best. The film obviously was inspired by the Lindsey Lohan story with the film diva being so out of control that she is forced into therapy. This film appears to be written for a G rating as it avoids any real life situations and the down to earth realities that real dramas involve. Disney can pull it off, but these film makers need to practice a little more before trying to produce something audiences may enjoy. I have seen better acting out of \"Three's Company\" re-runs, the only thing missing is the over the top laugh track. The guy playing the director, Mac, has an English (I think)accent that is about as believable as the shark in Jaws 4 ...remember, the one that roars? Lol. I would call this complete trash, but that would be giving it too much credit.",
         "I'm a fan of independent movies and like to see directors try to create something amazing with their limited resources, but honestly this movie isn't all that...The director and screenwriter, I assume are related... Sienna Young is a rising Hollywood star whose partying ways are destroying her career...so she is placed in a rehab centre were she finds herself, I must have watched 15 minutes before I gave it a rest..Mainly because of the horrendous acting and misplaced comedic moments...Torrey Devitto who has played the seductive types in One Tree Hill and Green Flash, fails to convince the audience she is a talented actress...And this is coming from a Torrey Devitto fan. Definitely one to avoid."
