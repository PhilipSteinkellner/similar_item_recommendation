         "Overseas production Casting Sands (her last film) and Lockhart and director Schultz to market the black action film market is a misfire. The film looks like a unfinished film! Co-star J. Eric Bell appears talking cool explaining the plot as himself (!) telling us about the movie. Bell has little to do as Sands brother in the film, but seems to have screen potential as himself in the begining of the film. The basic plot is Sands wins a contest to go to Lebennon and gets mixed up in a international plot concerning an assassinated African leader. Lockhart plays a mercenary who is also confused and teams up with Sands. People who went to the theatres (or rent this film on video) will be disappointed that this is not a \"black exploitation\" film. Title songs and post art work suggest it is, but it's not. Not recommended.",
         "Interpriter Laura Lewis (the delightful Diana Sands) wins a free trip to Lebanon. Her mischievous brother Skiggy (affable J. Eric Bell) and whiny TV show host Sam (the amusingly smarmy Seth Allen) tag along. Laura winds up becoming involved in an international plot concerning the assassination of a top African leader. Suave mercenary Liv (a nicely smooth turn by Calvin Lockhart) befriends Laura and comes to her rescue. Competently directed by Michael Schultz, with a groovy score by Michael Tschudin, a steady pace, pleasing chemistry between Sands and Lockhart, pretty, picturesque cinematography by Andreas Bellis, a light, breezy tone, occasional outbursts of thrilling action, beautiful locations, a funky, throbbing theme song, engaging characters, and solid acting from a personable cast (Tomas Baptiste in particular does well as the coolly malevolent head bad guy General Christian Awani), this picture makes for a nice little diversion.",
         "I guess the best way to characterize this film is it is an experimental artistic movie. Either you like it? Or you don't. Either you give it a 7, or a 3. The Rating here is definitely misleading to what this is. Compared to other movies from Miss Sands, Miss Sands has a lot more Acting quality than this film utilizes. BUT everybody watching the movie should understand the condition under which this film is created. The movie is taken Prior to her death from her illness. And that way the movie must be watched. As Homage, as last escape from what is dangling above her head. A wild, curious, chaotic, eccentric, adventurous trip. If you can feel what is going on here, the movie is there to Keep. And watch. Thank you."
