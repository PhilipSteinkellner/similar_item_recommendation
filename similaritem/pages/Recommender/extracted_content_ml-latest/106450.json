         "I cannot recall another movie of this type where the protagonist, an elderly mafia hit-man,comes across as one of the better individuals we encounter. And this impression manages to persist despite the multiple crimes we see him commit. Basically he's a bad guy doing bad things to bad people for a good reason. The scenes between Dannny Goldring as the burnt-out cop on the verge of retirement and Frank Vincent as the washed-up hit-man, two has-beens on opposite sides of the law, were especially well done. Solid performances by all the cast, especially Mike Starr as repulsive Mafia Boss Lorenzo Galante. Incidentally both Frank Vincent and Mike Starr appeared in Goodfellas. Personally I find this lower-key movie the better of the two. For some reason this movie seems to have been completely overlooked, perhaps the absence of moral blacks-and-whites put reviewers off. But if you like the genre you will enjoy this one.",
         "Frank Vincent is excellent as the senior citizen hit man who volunteers for one last big job. The acting by all concerned is above average, and the photography quite creative. There is of course plenty of violence, but it is not gratuitous. My only objection to \"Chicago Overcoat\" would be that Armand Assante and Mike Starr really have small roles for being featured on the DVD cover. It is Frank Vincent who shines throughout and almost singlehandedly carries the film. The story flows nicely and has a couple of minor twists and turns. Character development is especially strong, and along with the compelling script, delivers a very enjoyable movie experience. - MERK",
         "I have seen Goodfellas and Casino and No country for old men and this genre is as watchable on all levels. I'm just trying to get through to people who enjoy substance over CGI and i watched this without getting bored and I recommend it. This is not your usual suspects, in fact with little effort it has managed to make Old men Dangerous and young people should remember that there is no substitute for experience and being 50 years old myself means I am like Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven, Very Dangerous because Death is not the worst thing that can happen to you and you can take your time which is deadlier than any young punk on a mission",
         "If you can relate to the great American author Arthur Miller who wrote the stage and theater play Death of a Salesman than you know the tragic life that Willy Loman the main character in Death of a salesman had. Frank Vincent plays Lou Marazano an aging mobster muscle who never makes captain of his crew. Now Lou's legacy is his daughter and his young grandson. Lou realizes that he has not always been the best father to his daughter during his lifetime of criminal activities. He wants to make things right in his waning years. Lou's son-in-law is a low life criminal who would rather snort cocaine and hang out at the local strip club than spend any quality time with his wife and son. Lou takes it upon himself to just talk to his step son but this low life has little respect for an aging mobster who could never make captain in his crew. Lou needs to set this scumbag straight not on who he is as a man, but that his grandson needs his father and if his son-in-law does not want to fulfill his parental obligations Lou has an alternative plan. To make some extra money Lou agrees to take on the contract hits of three local stool pigeons who are going to proceed to court against a mob boss. Lou's signature for completing a contract hit was to always send the widow a bunch of flowers minus the sympathy card. There is an old detective named Ralph Maloney played very well by character actor Danny Goldring who remembers this old mobster's signature calling card but he has to prove that Lou Marazano has come out of retirement after almost 30 years of staying silent with his gun. So the chase is on and the story line I felt was not only appealing but intriguing and kept the audience guessing how this modern day Willy Loman copycat would end up. Actor Mike Starr plays mob boss Lorenzo Galante who is taking his instructions from the big boss Stefano D'Agnostino played by Armand Assante who orders the hit on the three witnesses that aging Lou Marazano pleads to take on as he really needs the money. We learn later that the assassination money is to be used for only good purposes which I don't want to spoil for anyone who has yet to see this good mobster film. Lou also has a love interest in the attractive Lorraine Lionello played by the versatile actress Kathrine Narducci. I just loved her role in the Chazz Palminteri 1993 crime film \"A Bronx Tale\". She played the mother of a young boy named Calogero who was torn between his love for his bus driver dad played by Robert DeNiro and the local mob boss Chazz Palminteri. In my opinion, this is one of the best crime films I have ever seen and it ranks right up there with the Godfather. As for Chicago Overcoat the title refers to a 1940's term for a gangster rubbing out his opposition and when the dead guy is in his coffin, he is termed to be wearing a Chicago overcoat. The film is well worth watching and I must say I like the way the film ended. I will say no more but encourage you to watch the film. I rate it a 6 out of 10.",
         "Quite a few reviews criticize this movie because of clichés. However, this movie is actually not predictable. Westerns also have certain kinds of characters, actions and conflicts that recur, but their stories are not always predictable either. The key question is one of the story's originality. Excessive clichés signal a lack of originality. This is not the issue in this movie at all. The basic story involves a hit-man who is now sidelined who wants a big contract so that he can make enough money to leave Chicago and go to Las Vegas. The contract is quite difficult, involving successive hits on potential witnesses. This is a fresh premise for a story. Within the story, a number of other fresh situations occur. The activities of Frank Vincent as the hit-man are not predictable. The climax and outcome of the story are not predictable. Vincent's relationships with an old flame, with his daughter, her husband and his grandson are not predictable. The movie handles all this very adeptly. Location photography adds a lot as others have noted. Vincent carries the movie very well, and he is not known for taking leading roles. It was easy to root for him or at least sympathize with him, despite his profession as a killer. Maybe it's also because he is so professional at what he does. He's not a sadistic psychopath. Part of this was because of his endearing relationship with his grandson, whom he counsels in several scenes. He wants him to stay away from guns and other bits of wisdom. I found this movie well-done and enjoyable.",
         "Lou Marazano, an aging mobster in Chicago, needs another job to help him get away from the city where he has lived all his life. The only way to do it is to ask Lorenzo Galante to give him some work. Unknown to him, mafia boss D'Agostino's trial is coming up. A few people must be eliminated, so Galante offers Lou a deal he cannot refuse. There are three people that know too much who are on the way of the boss' legal process. Lou's job, if accepted will get rid of the possible witnesses. Lou's life is not exactly a bed of roses. His relationship with Lorraine has seen better days. He has neglected her, so when he comes for her at the joint where she works, she figures he has changed. Wrong! Even though he obviously had a thing for her, he returns so she can be his alibi for the investigation that the police are going to pin on him, eventually. His estranged daughter is divorced, living with his grandson in the suburbs. Lou makes a mistake by sending flowers to the wife of the first man he kills. An old detective, Rey Berkowski, puts two and two together, remembering a string of killings that remind him of Lou's work. Marazano realizes he must act quickly if he wants to get away with some cash. Eventually, Galante and his men come after him. Lou is able to outsmart them all. \"Chicago Overcoat\" is an indie that showed up on cable recently. It was a surprise for us, not having a clue as to what it was all about. Based on a story by Brian Caunter, the director, and John Bosher, the screenplay is a collaboration by the duo with Andrew Dowd and Josh Staman. There is plenty of action for fans of the genre. In fact, there is nothing new in the film, and yet the viewer is never bored. Part of the success of the film is the wonderful cinematography by Kevin Moss who keeps his camera absorbing the atmosphere of Chicago at its photogenic best showing different ethnic areas in contrast with the sleek skyscrapers. The best reason for watching \"Chicago Overcoat\" is veteran character actor Frank Vincent, who has been seen in many films and series. Always a tough guy, he shows a different angle in this picture. He does amazing work for director Caunter. The supporting cast includes Kathrine Narducci, Mike Starr, Stacy Keach, and Armand Assante, among the large cast. Although this is a variation on a theme that has been seen before, the film does not disappoint.",
         "This surprisingly good independently made crime drama stars Frank Vincent as Lou Marazano, an aging Toddlin' Town hit-man now living in reduced circumstances. Lou hasn't made a hit in years, and is now mostly employed for minor league shakedowns, but when the opportunity for One Last Big Job arises � and with it the chance to set his daughter up for life � he leaps feet first. It's far from the most original of stories--and the film's production values are on-par with a made-for TV movie--but Vincent is excellent and Chi-Town looks great. Fans of gangster films will definitely enjoy it. Also noteworthy: Stacy Keach as an equally worn out cop and Kathrine Narducci as Lou's love interest.",
         "I really wanted to like this movie. But within the first few minutes its attempt at being a film noir was an epic fail. The script read like a theatrical production rather than a cinematic feature. And every character was a cliché: The main character, Lou, is an aging mob soldier who requests a murder contract in an attempt to capture his younger glory days. Add to that his longtime spurned lover, his dysfunctional daughter, his young and innocent grandson, and the pair of big city cops on his tail. Not only were all of the characters a cast of clichés, but the storyline was as well. To add to it, every character had one dimension of emotion, which was anger. It gave the audience no reason to like anyone or remain engaged in the story. By the end, this film became a caricature of itself.",
         "Director Brian Caunter has created a gem in Chigaco Overcoat. Starring Frank Vincent who has also been in other classic gangster flicks, Goodfellas 1990, Casino 1995 and other classic flicks, Animal Room 1995, Jungle Fever 1991, Last Exit to Brooklyn 1989, Do the Right Thing 1989 and Raging Bull 1980. Also starring Kathrine Narducci. Aso starring Mike Starr who has also been in other classic flicks, Wrong Turn at Tahoe 2009, Summer of Sam 1999, Born on the Fourth of July 1990, Last Exit to Brooklyn also with Frank Vincent and other classic gangster flicks, Goodfellas also with Frank Vincent and Millers Crossing 1990. Also starring Armand Assante who has also been in another classic flick, Blind Justice 1994 and another classic gangster flick, Federal Protection 2002. Also starring Stacy Keach who has also been in other classic flicks, Machete 2010, American History X 1998, The Long Riders 1980 and Up in Smoke 1978. I enjoyed the violence and shootouts. If you enjoyed this as much as I did then check out other classic gangster flicks, Bloody Mama 1970, The Butcher 2009, Dillinger 1973, Hit List 1989, Kill the Irishman 2011, Last Man Standing 1996, The Outfit 1973, Point Blank 1967, The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond 1960, The St. Valentine's Day Massacre 1967, Once Upon a Time in America 1984 and Mean Streets 1973.",
         "Good casting for Frank Vincent, in probably his best role to date. I enjoyed watching the film, with its combination of memoirs, anecdotal narrative and good old fashioned American Gagsterism. It is easy to look at this after the first few minutes and think it could be another Casino or Goodfellas, especially with the use of the narration, however it does not take that route in so much that it does not come over quite as 'smarmy' in the way Vincent is recalling his past compared to how Joe Peschi or more so Ray Liotta did it in theirs. The story does not also go beyond the realms of uncredibility and has a message in there somewhere, something about ageing and having few regrets. Once all that is done and set up the story is basically about Vincent - a tough but aged wise guy who still collects. He is itching to do a hit again and gets the nod. Once on the mission the story develops a bit more and includes other characters, such as his family and mistress. One of the best characters to come into the film at this point is the cop on his tail, who without going over the top on the clichés is a worthy adversary and as wise as Vincent. The films twist involves his boss who is the link to the Chicago underworld. Interesting that Vincent in his role is not dusted despite being out manned and out gunned, he walks away having wiped out all the competition. \"You know why? It was outta respect\"."

         "The Chicago Outfit was the most powerful organized crime syndicate of the 20th century, and Lou Marazano (Frank Vincent) was their deadliest hit man. Twenty years after his most notorious wave of hits Lou is a relic, his legend obscured, his talents forgotten, and his glory days over. When a high-profile union representative is arrested for tax fraud, the Outfit's top boss (Armand Assante) orders a string of key witnesses silenced before the government can uncover a vast conspiracy involving police officers, city officials, and mob affiliates. Lou sees the job as an opportunity to finance his retirement and leave Chicago with his girlfriend (Kathrine Narducci). But when relentless detectives (Danny Goldring & Stacy Keach) begin nipping at his heels, and the acting street boss (Mike Starr) decides to revoke Lou's membership to the Outfit, Lou must prove he is worthy of being the Outfit's most deadly hit man - a title he held more than twenty years ago.",
