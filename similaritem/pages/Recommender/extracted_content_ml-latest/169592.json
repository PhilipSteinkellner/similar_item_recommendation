As when she is describing how she would deal with someone so close to her face that their eyelashes became braided, 'I will cut you.' The first half of this standup routine is much better than the second half. In it she talks about their recent trip to Eurpope and how she coped with the automated seats in first class. She also explains how she brushed up on Europe by watching a movie ... \"Taken\" with Liam Neeson. The last part of her routine touches on her famous Vietnamese nail salon routine but instead of repeating it she delivers a few new impressions. Not as funny and inventive as the original but still entertaining. Angelah is cute and funny with great comedic timing for the delivery of her jokes. I found this on Netflix streaming."],
