      "synopsis": "The film is a black comedy, narrated by and centred around self-absorbed, manipulative, cynical teenager Dede Truitt (Christina Ricci), who runs away from home after her stepfather's funeral and moves in with her half-brother Bill (Martin Donovan), a teacher in a conservative, suburban community in Indiana. Dedee seduces Bill's young lover, Matt (Ivan Sergei), then tricks him into believing she has got pregnant by him. In fact, the father of her child is her ex-boyfriend Randy Cates (William Lee Scott). She and Matt elope, leaving Bill and the uptight Lucia (Lisa Kudrow), the sister of Bill's deceased partner Tom, to track them down and sort out the mess. In the meantime, Matt's \"bit on the side,\" Jason Bock (Johnny Galecki), attempts to blackmail Bill, claiming Bill sexually assaulted him while he was a student. Bill and Lucia find Dedee and Matt, only to discover Dedee has stolen Tom's ashes and is holding them for ransom. Randy also finds Dedee; they inform Matt that they are taking the ashes and moving to have the baby elsewhere. They escape but soon get into an argument that leads to Dede accidentally shooting Randy. She and Matt escape to Canada, and Bill eventually finds them. After the birth of Randy Jr., Dedee returns Tom's ashes to Bill, apologising for her actions in the past year. After a few months in prison, she moves back in with Bill, while Matt and Jason go traveling together, and Lucia marries her old friend Carl (Lyle Lovett). Eventually, Dede decides that Randy Jr. would be better off alone with Bill (who is now dating Dedee's parole officer) and runs away. Narrating the ending, Dedee sarcastically concludes that sex is precisely the opposite of what people should want, leading as it does to kids, disease or, worst of all, relationships. At the end of the film, the vignettes of the various caring relationships among the characters shows the opposite of superficial sexual gratification. Dede leaves it to the viewer to imagine whether or not she returns to her family.",

         "I absolutely love this film. Christina Ricci is perfectly cast and gives a great performance as a 16 year old who tries to manipulate and bully all of the other characters into bowing to her sick and twisted view of the world. While Ricci's character is not immediately likable she is somehow compelling and is effecting in driving the film. Ricci's character does and says hateful things throughout the movie but the film is successful in maintaining it's own view on these topics without squelching her characters voice. Hopefully what we see through her character is that despite the hateful things people do, there are real human beings behind these actions. I ended up liking the character for her survive at any cost mentality and her resolve. The movie is hilariously funny and at times touching. Lisa Kudro turns in another great performance as a lonely single girl who is pining for the affections of Ricci's gay half brother. The humor is not of the joke a minute or slapstick variety but grows out of the situations and relationships between compelling characters. The writing and directing are also superb. I especially liked scenes where the director showed how easily we can be manipulated by mood and music as well as the points that we show in a character's life. Ricci's narration is biting, wicked, clever, bitchy and witty. I can see however, how one could be offended and turned off by it. But the narration is not for shock effect but rather to frame the main character. I wouldn't change a frame or a line in this film. It's funny, intelligent and warm in a strange sort of way. A definite must see.",
         "The Opposite Of Sex \u0096 1998 The Opposite Of Sex stars two of my favourite actress' \u0096 Lisa Kudrow and Christina Ricci. Needless to say, they were my main motivations for seeing this film. Expecting a fairly average film you might say I was a little shocked when this turned out to be a well scripted, well acted, suitably gritty and compelling drama. The Opposite of Sex is narrated by the appropriately cynical lead character, Dede Truitt (Christina Ricci). The narration is highly amusing and witty and provides the audience with a release during tense and heavily themed situations. Dede Truitt basically walks into her half brothers life (Martin Donovan) and causes a stir among his sister in-law (Lisa Kudrow) by stealing his boyfriend who was originally thought to be gay and now decides he is bisexual. The whole film is constantly asking questions about Sex and what it has done to humanity. It works on two levels, one being that it has heavy themes and can be coarse at times. However Lisa Kudrow offers comic relief playing a straight square teacher who disapproves of everything and everyone in life especially sex. That is until she finds Sex on her doorstep. The Opposite of Sex is a brilliant film, when Christina Ricci was in her prime. It deserved much more praise than it got which is such as shame. 9/10",
         "The Opposite of Sex does what Don Roos set it out to do. It brings the subject of homosexuality in all its forms to light in a hard hitting, funny in your face joy ride - but yet it's not a 'gay movie'. Ricci is wonderful as Dedee, our young 'tour guide' to this strange journey. Through her eyes we see her world of lies, deception and confusion. At times you might not like her, but thats what is great about the movie, it pulls you in. If your into witty one liners, a fast story line and terrific acting (two thumbs up to Lisa Kudrow!)than this movie is for you. After a movie that makes you think about other peoples lifestyles and situations? give it a try. As an eighteen year old, I recommend this movie for older teens and up and give it a 8/10.",
         "I avoided seeing this movie for a long time but finally gave in last week. It was very funny, touching and insightful. It did occur to me that Lyle Lovett could use an acting lesson or two, and that Ivan Sergei is way too good looking; its borderline annoying. Martin Donovan and Kudrow make the movie; their characters were completely believable. Last but certainly not least is the best young American actress, Christina Ricci. She really makes every part she plays her own. I suggest the Christian Youth or whoever they are stay away; everyone in this movie has too many human qualities for you to tolerate.",
         "This film has laughs, but they are not all clumped in together. Which is good, because with a story like this, it is neccesary to have comedy in just the right spots. The film shows us Deede (played to perfection by hot Christina Ricci), a 16 year old going on 17 who is having a baby soon, but the results of the next 9 months will surprise everyone (which includes a cast of Martin Donovan, Lisa Kudrow, Johnny Galecki, Lyle Lovett and Ivan Serguei). A good idea becomes a close to very good film by vhaving a good lay out of a story and good sarcastic humor to match. One of the better films of 1998. A-",
         "I selected this movie on an impulse and ended up loving every bit of it. It isn't as black a comedy as most people profess, you laugh at some very witty scenes and a few conversations are very poignant and insightful. Note these bits: Lucia and Bill at the hotel in LA when they have a conversation about relationships, Matt and Bill at the log cabin in Canada and lastly, when Dedee delivers the last voice-over. I will remember this movie for quite some time. We have a trash-talking southerner: Christina Ricci (in one of her better roles) who takes some pretty illogical decisions in life and affects so many lives around her. Martin Donovan shines as her half-brother, seemingly very pacified and unnerved about things in life (a doormat personality, perhaps?). Watch out for Lisa Kudrow: she steals the show with her expressions and acting.",
         "Ricci, a wonderful actress, is an intolerable (and all-too-common, especially in \"indie\" films) bitch throughout--and she's narrating. If that doesn't drive you away, Lisa Kudrow's constant whining and the usually solid (but lackluster here) Martin Donovan's masochistic simp should finish you off. The script is loaded with the lazy young Turk's approach to \"clever observations about modern life\"--namely, two-bit cynicism, which was mildly fresh about 10 years ago. Potshots aplenty at Christians and gays--wow, how \"revolutionary\"! Oh, and Lyle Lovett does Lyle Lovett to a \"T.\" Still, this movie had potential; too bad it was utterly squandered by unimaginative direction, bad writing, and insufferable characters. What could've been a wry, dark comedy falls apart under the weight of all the post-modern pretense, nasty attitude, and Ricci's grating narration, a vapid effort at a clever conceit. Thank heavens she redeemed herself completely in later projects!",
         "A cast of talented actors and actresses does not make up for a what a tired and time consuming miss-match of a movie this is. One liners may be all the rage in 'Will & Grace' but this particular 'flick' left with a funny taste in my mouth (no pun). Character development is hidden away amongst the over-the-top narration. The story lacks emotion and depth and is very contrived - even for a Hollywood picture. It is a movie where the stars look quite simply out of place in their surroundings. High expectations of a wholesome quality film were suddenly tail-spinning just 30 minutes through. At the end of the movie we had crash landed and I wanted my money back.",
         "sorry, this is the biggest spoiler i´ll ever write, but this definetly is one of the most boring movies i´ve ever seen. the story-line is ridiculous dumb, the characters are unironical white-trash-squareheads and there´s not one character in the movie, that would be performed in an inspired way of acting: this is a square head soap opera. christina ricci plays as if she got a brain damage, martin donovan as if he had an overdose of valium and lisa kudrow is just a pain in the a**. the best actor in this movie is William Lee Scott (no joke! he´s definetly not one of the best actors ever, but hes the best one in here, hes even smart!) and maybe Lyle Lovett, but just because he´s got such a funny face. there´s definetly no reason to make such a boring movie, just because the subject (homosexuality) may offend someone. it seems as if the moviemakers tried to do a \"mainstream\" film about homosexuality: to provocate, but \"just a little\". just because one of the main characters says \"vagina! vagina! vagina!\" and another one talks about two men sucking each other´s d**** doesn´t make a good movie out of it. it´s like watching \"the wonder years\" with some obscene expressions in it. this movie is a waste of time! 2 out of 10 (and the two are for WL Scott and L Lovett) recommendations (just to proove that i´m not homophobic): ich bin meine eigene frau, boys dont cry, der bewegte mann.",
         "There's something so off-kilter about this film. Something that makes it stand apart from others of its kind. The structure is pretty complex, if one takes into accounts all of the turns in the story the film makes. The performances are aces, but Kudrow really stands far and away at the top. One of the finest TV actresses ever, if not the finest (her work in TV is masterful) she has the perfect blend of comedy and drama here. Her work is effective on a dramatic level, even though it's also a pretty hilarious turn. This is a fantastic performance, hitting all of the right notes and pitch-perfect keys that one can hit. This is highly recommended."
