         "I didn't really know what to expect from this movie when I first started watching it. It was just playing on TV one night and I decided to turn it on and see what it was about. I know some other people no here criticized it left, right and center - but I think those people are just wannabe critics and they didn't appreciate the movie for what it had to offer. Now, I'm not a professional movie critic and I never went to film school, but I watch A LOT of movies and I can recognize a good one from a bad one - and this one was good. The characters were lovable and the actors who played them did an excellent job of drawing you into the plot ad the story of these people's lives. I also think - while I know someone else on here wrote that the dialogue was so scripted - I think the opposite!! The dialogue was very unscripted and I swear that I have had some of those types of conversations with my friends which are very natural conversations. As well, the actors and actresses did an excellent job of bringing humour to the story where it was needed, and serious drama when that was right for the situation. They even managed to mix in a wonderful romance plot which I just loved (you have to see the movie for that romance if for nothing else). Anyways, I think that this movie is definitely worth a watch and I will certainly be recommending this movie to all of my friends.",
         "I saw this at VIFF - a friend told me about it and luckily they had added another screening so I was able to see it. And I loved it! I can't believe they made such a wonderful film for so little money. It just goes to prove that where there's a will, there's a way! I thought the acting was superb. Kristin Booth played the phobias so genuinely and somehow managed to balance a lightness with this serious subject, and then could make me laugh out loud. And I can't remember when a romantic comedy has done that - most of the time they lean heavily toward romantic and forget about the comedy part and this film has both. And Aaron Abrams was fantastic, too. I'm pretty sure every woman who sees this film will fall just a little bit in love with him. Had this film been made with more money it probably would have lost the thing that makes it so special - its heart. I hope this film makes it to theatres or at least DVD - I want to see it again and next time I'm bringing all my girlfriends!",
         "I saw this film at VIFF and was very pleasantly surprised! The story behind its making is inspiring and the filmmakers are clearly passionate, and as a bonus - the film is really good! It is a quirky but straightforward story that to some may just be a charming tale of love against the odds, but to others may have a deeper connection to personal struggles and living with fear. The performances are terrific; the supporting cast of strange but lovable characters are almost cartoon-like but manage to avoid being one dimensional, Kristin Booth in the lead somehow pulls off the oddness of her character without alienating the audience, and Aaron Abrams is absolutely charming. It's nice to see a Canadian film that is sweet and uncomplicated - it left me with a smile and a bounce in my step. If you are a fan of Pushing Daisies you'll appreciate the style of this film - even though the film was made on a fraction of the budget of one episode of Daisies. If it comes to your town, go out and see it!",
         "I was pleasantly surprised by this little comedy about a woman so taken in by various phobias she hasn't left her apartment in six years. While the entire film is set in her apartment, it doesn't get claustrophobic due to a cast of interesting characters who visit, including a neighbour, the UPS guy and an amorous janitor. The mood is established right at the beginning with a light animated sequence explaining the origin of Romy's fears. It sets the tone perfectly for the remainder of the film. Aaron Abrams is fabulous as the new neighbour who cares nothing for her or her troubles until he discovers she is a travel agent, and can be of use to him. And Kristen Booth has the acting chops to perform slightly exaggerated comedy, demanded by the material, without ever hitting the slapstick threshold--a feat in itself. The va-et-vient between Booth and Abrams is as well-written and entertaining as the chemistry between them is obvious. When it was over I discovered that I had been totally charmed by this film and immediately added it to my \"to buy\" list (I watched a rental) so that I can re-watch at will.",
         "I needed a light romantic comedy tonight and I was so thrilled that I found this movie on Netflix. I was delighted by the story and the playful way that it was presented. I came away from it feeling compelled to express my appreciation. This is the first time that I have wanted to submit a review. I was surprised to see a review that was so negative because it really made me feel uplifted and inspired. I know that others will like it too if they give it a chance. I was also proud that it was a Canadian production. It was neat to see little bits of Toronto. Kristin and Aaron were awesome and Gordon Pinsent's voice added to the warmth of the movie. Bravo!!",
         "I have to say, I was browsing the TV the one night and happened upon this movie about a quarter of the way through. From the moment I started watching it, I was hooked. Kristen Booth does an excellent job of portraying the emotionally fragile Romy, too afraid to leave her apartment due to events in her life that have taught her to be afraid of the outside world . Her five fears, listed in no particular order were: Opening Boxes, Lobsters, Storms, Kissing, and Going Outside. Each fear has a reason, introduced at the beginning of the movie in an ingenious way. She's created a life for herself by becoming a travel agent, working from home. Many will note the irony of someone planning vacations for others, while she remains in her apartment. Then along comes Guy (a name we don't find out until the last half of the movie) played by the talented and gorgeous Aaron Abrams. Now, I have to say he was probably the best part of the movie for me. Adorable and funny and was the perfect counterpart for Kristen Booth. They play off each other with perfect chemistry. Guy is a traveller, living across from her only for a short time to clean out his great-aunts apartment (who passes away shortly into the movie). He is someone who has no roots...to him, it's unfathomable that Romy would want to live the way she does. Somehow, these two perfect opposites, become perfect for each other. Guy coaxes her into releasing her fears, one by one. I don't want to give too much away, but I have to admit that this is a true love story in every way - their \"date\" that Romy puts together is adorable and funny. I've never been one for supporting Canadian content...it's not that I didn't want to, just that I never saw too many shows or movies that lived up to their American counterparts. However, I have to say this movie was truly a joy and I'm proud that this is Canadian made. I pre-ordered this off iTunes and downloaded it today when it finally was available. Recommended highly!",
         "The longer I watched the movie the more I found myself enjoying it and rooting for Romy to overcome her fears and to join the outside world. The movie goes on an interesting journey with a neat beginning that doesn't delve too much on Romy's history. We know that she had some incidents that left her emotionally scarred and unable to go outside for fear of something catastrophic happening. Since the movie mostly takes place in Romy's apartment it was interesting to see how the scenes would pan out and it worked for the most part. I was more engaged in Romy and her problems and her interactions with the other characters to get distracted by the apartment setting. The love angle did seem a little rushed and initially it didn't seem that Guy and Romy looked good together but I have to make some allowances. Without any romantic angle the movie probably would be a lot shorter. The acting is done well by the whole cast involved, the comedy and jokes are funny and I liked the ending so what more can you ask for? It's a good light hearted affair that's definitely worth watching. It's best enjoyed with a cup of hot chocolate and a cookie, and your sweetheart nearby!",
         "I wanted to have a romantic movie night with my girlfriend, BUT THIS MOVIE TOTALLY SPOILED IT!!! I cannot understand who votes 10/10 for this: Boring story, boring cinematography, boring jokes and especially, an utterly annoying protagonists... What annoyed us most is that the idea of the story is even pretty creative, after watching it however we were surprised how the screen writers/director managed it to make nothing, really nothing at all out of it. I read about Kirsten Booth that she might be an upcoming actress, but with those kind of films, no chance. If you want something romantic, grab the hand of your loved one and smile at each other...",
         "I should have known better than to see a film that was being self-released. There's a reason no companies took a chance releasing this film. It's just not good. It's actually pretty terrible. Though Kristen Booth is an engaging, interesting rising star, this movie is proof that that's just not enough to carry a film. If DeNiro and Pacino couldn't save Righteous Kill, what chance does Kirsten have. I see some positive reviews for this film on the IMDb site. It's nice to know that the crew and parents of the director think this is a good movie, unfortunately, that doesn't make it so. The whole thing goes wrong at the script phase and then only gets compounded by incompetent film making. The pacing, tone and overall aesthetic are so severally lacking, it's a wonder the director has even watched, let alone, made a movie before. At Home by Myself with You is one of the most painful cinema going experiences I've ever had (and not just matching it up against studio films � I see a lot of other indie films as well). Kristen Booth is a talented actress, but she may need to find a better agent if she is getting mixed up with bad movies like this one. 3 out of 10, and she get's all 3 of those stares.",
         "I really, really wanted to like this movie. The story behind it is inspiring. Indie director raises money through pocket change to make his dream feature. It's a feel good story. Unfortunately, the film is just not good. It's actually pretty bad. It's decently photographed and the acting is competent (for what the cast had to work with) but where it really falls down is the script. Pedantic doesn't even begin to describe it. It's formulaic writing at it's absolute worst. From bad dialogue choices to boring characters, this film was several rewrites away from being ready for filming. I think there's a lesson in this film, and it's a sad one. If you have to beg for change to make a movie -- you should make sure the movie you are making is worth it. Well many in Canada bemoan the public funding agencies, they do serve their purpose in that they are a litmus test for whether or not a project has any appeal. At Home By Myself with You simply does not."
