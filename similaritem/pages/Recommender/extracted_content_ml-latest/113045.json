         "This is not a movie for anyone. It is mainly targeted to an audience that has read at least some of the thousands comics of \"Boggie el aceitoso,\" Spanish for 'Oily Boogie.' Created by the late Argentine cartoonist Roberto Fontanarrosa, Boogie parodies the American stereotype of the macho, tough guy American hero. Faithful to the aforementioned comics, which started being published in South America in 1974 and ended in 1995, Boogie is presented as a anti-hero who lives as a callous and merciless hit man in what appears to be New York City. Oily Boogie is thus a gun-for-hire and he couldn't care less about the target as long as the money being offered is good enough. In this low budget yet highly original movie, Oily Boogie is the ultimate sociopath: a rude, uncouth, chauvinistic, misogynistic, warmongering alpha male. The script is very well done and it greatly helps to enhance all these negatives tendencies in Oily Boogie. Jingoistic people should abstain to see this movie because, undoubtedly, they will find it offensive and grossly anti-American. Indeed, cartoonist Fontanarrosa was highly critical of the many wars the United States was involved in ---Vietnam in particular. Oily Boogie is an extreme version of the \"Ugly American\" seen by the eyes of anti-war cartoonist from Rosario, Argentina. The movie is fast-paced, funny and somewhat unpredictable. Its violence is so extreme is laughable, and the main character, Oily Boogie, is so cynical it can make the audience laugh or just leave the theater...",
         "I never thought a movie about Boogie could be this good. It's so faithful to the comics, it even includes a couple of jokes from them - the best ones I ever read, actually. The drawing style is exactly as I'd have thought Boogie should look like in a movie - Boogie's voice is dry, sarcastic and funny. I'd think as a whole, it's a bit more violent than the comics ever were; nevertheless the whole package is perfectly executed. It's a terrific tribute to Fontanarrosa's work. Highly recommended (if you ever liked Boogie in the first place - I suppose it's too violent for most people).",
         "\"Boogie, the oily one\" is an adaptation of the comic created by Roberto Fontanarrosa. I never read the original comic, but I loved this movie. It was filled with intense, thrilling action from beginning to end (And that are much better than the action from many modern action movies) but also have a dark sense of humor; the elements of comedy made this film highly enjoyable: The casual viewer can see this film as a spoof of the stereotypes from action flicks, or simply enjoy it as a exciting story of criminals and mercenaries. The animation was incredibly good, the designs were pretty stylish and well made. It was pretty interesting to see other styles of animation, besides CGi, Disney and anime. Personally, I liked this film more than things as \"Wanted\" \"300\" and \"Sin City\". 10/10",
         "BLOOD BLOOD BLOOD, So much crimes and they are so cool, this is an Argentinian movie, it is really great, is a perfect comedy with a lot of black humor. It is an animation movie with bizarre crimes and so much blood, Boggie is a hired murderer, he is hired to make all type of crimes and he uses all types of methods to achieve what he wants. For the ones who always look for famous actors i will say that you won't find anyone in this movie except you are Argentine. The movie is based on one of the comics that made Roberto \"El Negro\" Fontanarrosa (Argentinian writer, for me one of the best writing comics, the comic is also named \"Boggie, El Aceitoso\", i give it a 7 but it can also be an 8, I hope you like it, greetings. maxi0305",
         "The man known as Boogie in this animated film designed to shock seems pretty proud that he is practically every�ist known to man; racist, misogynist, sexist etc. As a mercenary Boogie was a highly trained emotionless killer for hire, criss-crossing the globe looking for random foreign people to fill with holes. Then he ran out of wars. As an assassin he was equally lethal and cold blooded, only the pay per head was more lucrative. Boogie never turned down a job regardless of the danger, he therefore became the man they called when the job couldn't be done. As a lover Boogie is similarly distant and only available to deal on his terms. For some reason this never bothered the lengthy queue of willing women. Boogie is his own man, an uncomplicated beast with no man or woman as his master, living life � and taking the lives of others � the way he wants to, cops, bad guys, women, kids and dogs, none are spared his violent whims. As a film though, Boogie is pretty ordinary, especially when you swiftly realise that the extreme violence and reprehensible nature of the lead character are supposed to be the entertainment. Boogie is quite short at well under 90 minutes, the action ramping up when the formerly irrepressible Boogie discovers that a newer model of assassin is on the scene, better trained, younger, faster, better equipped and *GASP* cheaper than he. As an F.U. you the system Boogie thwarts the new assassin's job and decides to protect the intended target, a young waitress with secrets that could bring the kingpin of the local much feared crime syndicate down. Many films are decried because of the over the top nature of the violence, without it this film would have no noticeable features whatsoever, but after you see Boogie the kid get shot and the cat get fricasseed the quite literal 'cartoonish' novelty very quickly wears off. The promoters of this DVD have cleverly marketed it to viewers looking for the latest in 'extreme whatever' by proudly describing the film as \"Sexist, violent and sadistic\", for some reason that gets the punters curious � including me � but it doesn't entertain them for long. Final Rating � 4.5 / 10. I'm sure this DVD will end up in many an 18-21 year old's collection, where it will gather dust for a few years before being turfed, with the owner wondering just what he thought he saw in the first place.",
