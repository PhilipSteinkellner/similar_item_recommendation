         "This was always one of my favourite A&C's, and as a previous commenter stated, definitely their best for MGM! Imho their best period overall was with Universal during WW2, but this is on the same level and the generally higher production values more than compensating me for the loss of that special Universal atmosphere. It only came about because MGM wanted to re-use the sets from the film they'd just made of Kismet with Ronald Colman, so John Grant set about writing a pastiche version for the duo. At Port Inferno in Africa Bud & Lou are travelling magicians Garvey & Johnson but only making a living thanks to the alluring insistence of the top star Marilyn Maxwell; they all get ravelled up in young Prince Ramo's attempts to overthrow the throne of his wicked uncle Nimativ (full of vitamins one supposes). On the way they also get ravelled up in many of A&C's wacky routines including Don't say Tin, a bit of piffle-diffle, the classic Pokomoko sketch, Lou trying to sleep with a mouthful of beard, and my favourite the Hi Mike sketch \u0096 poor devil: shot to death twice, once with a knife! Douglas Dumbrille played Nimativ perfectly as a despot with a human side, even wanting to take Maxwell as wife no. 38. Maxwell had a great song with What Does It Take, while Jimmy Dorsey and his Orch. unfortunately dressed as Arab tribesmen had a couple of interesting well staged and photographed numbers. I wonder if the scenes would have been condemned by todays professional critics if someone like Louis Armstrong (and his Orch.) had been ridiculously togged up thus instead of Dorsey? For the fan there are many entertaining scenes, some snappy smart ass dialogue going on and the film is a toe-curling pleasure from start to finish; please refer to commenter no. 1 from 2000 if you're not a fan and have as much time to kill as he did.",
         "The review dated 21 May 2000 is indeed amazing. The reviewer states that he never cared for Bud and Lou. Well, dear reader, I sure hope that y-o-u never waste your time on a topic that you have no interest in. Profit from Ron's time-wasting and do what you enjoy. This film, which may be a step-up, budget-wise, may also be a step down in content, to some. It is definitely a product of its time and audiences of World War II couldn't get enough of Abbott & Costello. If you enjoy big band music, the idea of Jimmy Dorsey's band will excite you. To see one of the era's prettiest women, Marilyn Maxwell, this is a fine showcase. Just as every Bogart film isn't CASABLANCA, every A & C film isn't MEET FRANKENSTEIN. But this one will do ...",
         "Lost In A Harem is one of the best Abbott & Costello films for 3 reasons: One, unlike most of their films in the 1940s which were produced at Universal Studios (and available on DVD in a Universal set), this one was done at MGM with that studios usual higher production standards, including a few spectacular musical numbers. Two, it is one of only about a dozen filmed appearances of big band great Jimmmy Dorsey, who performs, with his band, a number called John Silver (\"15 men on a dead man's chest\") which I haven't found elsewhere, and a few other songs. Three, the \"Pokomoko\" routine (\"Slowwwwly I turned, step by step I crept upon him . . .\") is done to perfection by A&C with Murray Leonard as the Derelict, which I've always remembered as one of my favorite A&C routines since I was ten years old. Furthermore, there's a real live giant (Lock Martin), full costumes and exotic sets as you would expect from MGM, a magic skit by A&C, hypnotism, a fine performance from Douglas Dumbrille as the bad guy, and more good music. I would rate it below Abott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, In The Navy, In Society, The Naughty Nineties, and perhaps 3 or 4 others, but definitely in their top ten or twelve. But since it's not in the Universal set, it's not available on DVD anywhere.",
         "\"Lost In A Harem\" is Abbott and Costello's second Universal loan-out to MGM. As such, the film benefits from MGM's always excellent production values, but loses much in the fact that MGM didn't have a big comedy unit. Bud and Lou play entertainers stranded in the Middle East with singer Marilyn Maxwell. They are enlisted by a Sheik who schemes to overthrow his evil uncle with their help. A&C aren't bad, but there appears to be some energy missing from their performance. This is probably due to Lou's tough year in 1943; his bout with Rheumatic Fever, coupled with his son's tragic death, undoubtedly contributed to this (this was their first filmed effort in 1944, although \"In Society,\" filmed after this, was released earlier.) A&C's carbon copy of the Three Stooges' \"Niagara Falls\" routine doesn't help either. Musical numbers abound, padding the film length to an unwieldly (at least, for A&C) 89 minutes. Also probably contributing to the downturn in humor was the team's pay cut at MGM! The print used in the video version is scratchy, which also doesn't help matters. There are other funny moments, including seeing Jimmy Dorsey in a fez, but the tedium in the film outweighs moments of hilarity, keeping \"Lost In a Harem\" a notch below the team's middling efforts. All in all, A&C were better off at Universal. 5 out of 10.",
         "John Conte is the renegade Prince in hiding with his desert tribesmen, with both a yen for Marilyn Maxwell and an interest in getting back the throne that his Uncle, Douglass Dumbrille, has stolen from him. The first I can understand, but who does he get to aid him in his second objective. Marilyn, stranded showgirl in the desert, and her sidekicks Abbott and Costello. If you're willing to suspend reality and believe' that anyone looking to pull off a coup d'etat is looking for help from Abbott and Costello, well then sit back and enjoy the fun. I have to say that the boys are up to their usual monkeyshines and Marilyn Maxwell is inclined to make any self-respecting prince drool, but the real treat is Douglass Dumbrille. Dumbrille was a fine character actor who usually played smooth villains. He's probably best remembered for being the lawyer trying to cheat Gary Cooper out of his inheritance in Mister Deeds Goes To Town. However there are moments went Dumbrille shows a nice sense of comic timing and plays a very good straight man for Costello. Hypnosis is one of the tricks in Dumbrille's bag and he hypnotizes the boys, Marilyn Maxwell, and even the whole Jimmy Dorsey band. I guess they like swing music on the desert. Dumbrille played a similar function in The Big Store with the Marx Brothers. He gets right into the clowning with them also. There's a woman who plays one of Dumbrille's hare girls who looks a lot like Rosie O'Donnell. Naturally at one point the plot calls for Costello to get into drag and disguise himself as her to fool Dumbrille. Good, funny, Abbott and Costello nonsense. Easily the best of the films they did on that MGM loan out from Universal.",
         "Mildly amusing A&C. Moving over to big-budget MGM means bigger production values than usual. And some of the Middle-East cityscapes are really impressive. The boys are helping the prince of the realm (Conte) regain the throne from the evil usurper Nimativ (Dumbrille). Needless to say, their help is a lot funnier than effective. The sketches are okay but the connecting narrative is flatter than usual. And too bad we don't see more of the harem than the pudgy little keeper who looks a lot like Costello\u2014a funny bit. Actually, my favorite part is the frenetic dance routine imaginatively set to the exotic strains of Scheherezade\u2014the long scarves flying fast and furious. Surprisingly, we don't see much of Jimmy Dorsey and his orchestra, despite their featured billing. At the same time, there's the lovely Marilyn Maxwell who mostly gets to stand around and look blonde. Some of the funnier parts\u2014pretending to be Hollywood talent scouts to get the harem girls on their side, the derelict (Leonard) doing his \"Slowly I turn\u0085\" bit that usually ends with Costello looking like a pretzel, and the invisible man routine that turns Costello into a janitor. Anyway, it's a peppy 90-minutes and if not among their best, at least it has its share of laughs.",
         "There's a great sight gag at the beginning of this picture when the Arab is about to enter the Cafe of All Nations. There are two posters announcing the acts, with the main one showing photos of Marilyn Maxwell's character, Hazel Moon. The one off to the right, seemingly intended for a foreign audience, leaves the names of the entertainers in English, but substitutes Arabic characters for the pictures of Maxwell! A pretty clever gimmick, but you have to pay attention to catch it. Speaking of Maxwell, I had to check something out as soon as I heard the line in her song about getting 'Frank Sinatra too'. Having just finished reading Shawn Levy's book \"Rat Pack Confidential\", I was struck by the number of celebrity women he bedded down, and the lineup reads like a cast of thousands. Sure enough, Marilyn Maxwell's on the list, and to save you a little time looking it up, it's page 199. But hey, it's an Abbott and Costello picture, so I probably should mention something about them too. I was a big fan of theirs as a kid, and this one probably falls somewhere in the middle as far as entertainment value goes. I don't remember in which film I first saw the 'Slowly I Turned' schtick, but it's overdone here, with Niagara Falls replaced by Pokomoko. One thing I didn't expect was Abbott and villain Douglas Dumbrille reprising that Marx Brothers mirror gimmick from 1933's \"Duck Soup\". Then there's Jimmy Dorsey and his big band lending a few musical numbers to the picture. All the while I kept wondering how believable this movie might have played back in the Forties, whereas today the PC police would be all over it. Apparently Universal Pictures liked the desert concept well enough to bring the boys back, along with Dumbrille no less, in 1950's \"A&C in the Foreign Legion\". Dumbrille was one of your all purpose villains, who appeared with A&C often enough (see also \"Ride 'Em Cowboy), and his character here is Prince Nimativ (Vitamin backwards). Costello gets in a reference to his home town, but alas, unlike his stint in the Foreign Legion, he doesn't get to kiss any harem girls in this one.",
         "Like MGM's previous Abbott and Costello film, RIO RITA, LOST IN A HAREM has a sound and feel to it that is indicative of being filmed in a sound stage with lots of echo--an odd choice for a desert film. As a result, the film has a certain artificial and claustrophobic feel to it. Why MGM wouldn't take this immensely popular comedy team (one of the biggest box office draws of the era) and put them in a higher quality film is a mystery. MGM had a habit of misusing comedy teams--particularly in the post-Irving Thalberg era. Now this doesn't mean that they cut lots of corners indoors, but what they did do wasn't exactly crowd-pleasing. These musical numbers were even more lavish than those in the Universal Pictures films the team made and starred Jimmy Dorsey and his famous orchestra--in the desert. All these songs didn't give the fans what they wanted--more Abbott and Costello. As a result, their three MGM films failed to make the money the studio had expected. Despite these shortcomings, the film does have some laughs. While far from sophisticated, the prison skits with the seriously crazy cell-mate are pretty funny and are based on old Vaudeville routines--particularly the 'Pokomoko' skit. In fact, it was done in other films and by other comedy teams (such as The Three Stooges)--and was probably done by other comedy teams long before Abbott and Costello. Murray Leonard was very funny (though far from subtle) in these routines and worked well with the team. As for the plot, it's a bit silly and unfortunately also has the formulaic lady and her love interest (who really do little in the way of plot or comedy). In this case, a beautiful blonde just happens to be in this desert country and the boys are trying to help her escape back to America. Unfortunately, there is an evil usurper (Douglass Dumbrille--who was pretty funny in a cartoony way) who has taken the throne and uses his cool hypno-rings to make people do his bidding. He immediately is taken by the blonde and the boys get caught up in a plot by the rightful monarch (is this an oxymoron?) to get the hypno-rings--helping him and the rebels to depose Dumbrille. Naturally, much of the film consists of the boys running about the palace and trying to avoid being executed. Whether you like this film will depend a lot on whether or not you find these antics funny. Abbott and Costello fans will clearly find enough to merit watching, though those not familiar with the duo might find this hard-going, as the film is watchable but far from their best.",
         "Abbott & Costello play two inept magicians on tour in the Middle East who somehow get mixed up with a young prince who has been cheated out of his rightful place on the throne by his scheming uncle who has used two magical rings to maintain his power base. The team evades all kinds of obstacles, and go to all kinds of lengths to help out. Marilyn Maxwell plays the leader of the title harem. One of the few films not made at Universal Studios(their main home), but instead MGM. Too bad this unfunny and inept film is one of them, because it is mostly beneath their talents, since their routines don't work so well in this setting, being too forced and outlandish to succeed.",
         "Another very funny vehicle for Abbott & Costello -- this time in a sultan's kingdom in the Middle East. I'd forgotten just how funny Lou Costello was...and he certainly is here. A highlight is the old \"Slowly I turn, step by step\" routine, with Costello being the recipient of the repeated rage. Some things seem a bit odd, like how does Jimmy Dorsey's orchestra end up in Arabia? Depending on how enamored you are with certain routines by Abbott & Costello, you'll be pleased or disappointed when they show up...again. Some are classics, and bear repeating. But if you watch several of their films over a short period, it gets to be a bit much. There is one quite good dance number. The plot here is pretty simple -- Abbott & Costello have to save an American girl from having to marry the local sheik. It's pretty standard Abbot & Costello fare, but it is funny!",
         "Silky Smooth Looking A & C Movie from MGM (one of three). Of Course, True to Form, the Studio with \"More Stars than in the Heavens\", were Myopic and Misused Many that They Put Through the Lens at the Tinseltown Behemoth. Nowhere Near as Bad as Rio Rita (1942 an MGM flop), because for One Thing the Mid-East Setting is Used to Advantage, and the Musical Numbers are Thankfully Removed from Operatic to Swing, with Jimmy Dorsey On Hand to Present a Couple of Neat Ditties. Some of the Routines are Peppy and the Story is Rich Enough to Sustain the Shenanigans, the Wordplay is Welcome, and Marilyn Maxwell is a Beauty. The Somewhat Secular Setting Would Draw Religious Criticism from Muslim Fundamentalist Today, but This Was a Different Time. There are No Close-Ups or Lingering on the Harem Girls as They are Regulated to Background and Musical Numbers. Another Clueless MGM Misfire. The Studio Sets are Leftovers, but are Impressive. Mid-Range Abbott and Costello Movie (they made dozens). Worth a Watch for Fans and Non Fans Alike.",
         "If Bob and Bing didn't have you laughing at modern Arabs in \"The Road to Morocco\", try Abbott and Costello as bumbling comics helping an Arab prince (John Conte) winning back his throne from an evil uncle (Douglas Dumbrille) and helping the heroine (Marilyn Maxwell). Elaborate sets, corny but funny gags (\"Slowly I Turned!\") and even some musical bits by Jimmy Dorsey make this one of the best of the Abbott & Costello pairings, ironic considering that this was at MGM, not their home studio of Universal. Little on plot but mighty on gags, this is best remembered for the running gag concerning an imprisoned man who goes nuts every time he hears the phrase \"Poco Moco\". Stereotypical clichés of Arab life are made palatable by the vaudeville style routines. The mad man with an invisible friend serves invisible drinks in invisible glasses that makes smashing noises when dropped, an invisible piano that actually plays, and a mind reader smartly reacting to Costello's thoughts. After providing villainy to the comedy teams of the Marx Brothers and Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, Dumbrille adds humor to the character of the evil uncle, even getting into drag! Just beware of his cat's eye rings... The three MGM films that Abbott and Costello made were more lavish than the ones they made at Universal. There, the Andrews Sisters and Ella Fitzgerald were among those utilized for specialty musical sequences, but here, they get lavish production numbers. The famous Marx Brothers sequence from \"Duck Soup\" is burlesqued here, and even if unoriginal, is still funny. The result is one of MGM's great farces with a team whose comedy doesn't seem to date in spite of its corniness.",
         "Having just seen \"The Noose Hangs High\" this movie fell pretty flat by comparison. The first instinct is to blame MGM but then A&C's \"Rio Rita\" was from MGM and was intensely funny. The problems lie in the continual bad pacing created by trying to combine Bud and Lou's comedy with the lavish MGM musical. The two just don't mix. Problem #2 is that good comedy need be tied to real life, and nobody at MGM bothered to figure out where exactly the story is set. Nothing has even a fictional or slapstick truth to it. One of the great vaudeville comedy routines also fails. It's done elsewhere by Abbott and Costello as the \"Niagara Falls! slowly I turned, step by step....\" routine. Herein it's done with another name, is less funny, and is repeated 9 times till we're sick of it. Even Abbott and Costello have an off-day. Skip this one and instead choose one of their great comedies from Universal. Just as Universal \"owned\" horror movies, they also knew how to let these guys be funny.",
         "One of the slick films Abbott and Costello made when they were loaned out to MGM in between work at their main studio, Universal. It's pretty good, if not among their best work. Here they play two lame comics traveling in a show with a beautiful blonde singer (Marilyn Maxwell), who get stranded in a weird city in the East. All three then join forces in helping a young sheik overthrow his uncle, who is a wicked sultan. A few good routines are included (the classic \"Slowly I Turned\" for one), but this adventure is also a little too bulky at nearly 90 minutes length, with a few typical musical routines sprinkled throughout. Also features an out of place performance by Jimmy Dorsey (who wears a fez!) and his orchestra. **1/2 out of ****",
         "This movie starts decently. The first A&C scene is an amusing one in which Costello screws up a magic act. It's completely idiotic, but it's funny, which can also be said of a scene in prison. But as the movie continues, the funniness contracts as the stupidity expands. By the time the duo is running around the titular harem I was thoroughly bored. I gave up on the movie altogether about a third of the way through, annoyed the the lack of laughs combined with a particularly dumb story. The movie is slickly made, with tolerable musical numbers, but it's decidedly weak in terms of A&C films.",
         "The second of three films Bud and Lou did for MGM is an improvement over the first, Rio Rita. The plot, such that it matters, has the boys in the Middle East with singer Marilyn Maxwell trying to help a prince regain his throne from his evil uncle (Douglas Dumbrille). Marilyn provides the pretty. Dumbrille is a good heavy. Some nice music from Jimmy Dorsey and his orchestra. Far better than the opera-y stuff from Rio Rita and less obtrusive. The comedy is also better in this one. Although, like the other two MGM films A&C did, some of the best laughs come from other actors NOT Bud and Lou. One of the funnier bits in this one is an old vaudeville routine called \"Slowly I Turned\" that many of you will probably remember from a famous I Love Lucy episode. Despite being familiar with the bit, I still thought it was pretty funny and performed well in the film by Murray Leonard. It's not the best Abbott and Costello movie but it is enjoyable. If you're new to their work, you'll probably like it a lot more.",
         "This is an absolutely abominable picture. Abbott & Costello were never very good, even at their best. They are not anywhere near their best in this garbage. In addition to the usual supposedly funny situations that routinely happen in one of these \"comedians loose in a harem\" type movies, A&C manage to add more drivel. EXAMPLE: There are two really stupid scenes that take place in different jail cells where they encounter an obnoxious looney-bin character who actually reprises the tired and old \"Niagra Falls, slowly I turned\" routine. And, since this is an A&C picture, the bit, unfunny to start with, is naturally overdone. The second jailhouse scene with the fruitcake lasts about 15 minutes, which is about 14 minutes too long. What makes it worse is that the scene seems to last for an hour. I admit that I never cared for A&C but, it many of their films, I could find a couple of laughs. But, for me, there were no laughs in this turkey. Just, tired old routines that contributed to the boredom factor."
