         "content": "**The food comes first. The life's later or maybe never.**\r\n\r\nThe title reveals everything, but still you must watch this to know how everything going to take place. Life on earth is meant for survival of the fittest, but the human evolution changed that idea and again, what happen when the rules we are used to have changed back to the original? This is a post apocalyptic theme set in somewhere in the Britain and revolves around three people who are fighting for their survival, everyday.\r\n\r\nThe feature film debut for the director, who also managed the screenplay quite superbly. You can find many similar films, but everyone of those has its own story with the backdrop of various threats and other issues to deal. Also, when the circumstances differ, the following events take a different lead. Thus giving the viewers a new perspective and entertainment.\r\n\r\nThis is nothing like those I had seen. It was too rough and tough in revealing stuffs to the facts of its state of condition. I mean the humans have lost the trust between one another. You might say that is common in all the post-apocalyptic films, but this is very good at details. A silent film, like background score was almost zero, so the appeal was stronger in every those thrill scenes like it was real or some kind of a documentary film.\r\n\r\nA man is living alone in the middle of the forest, grows his own vegetables and always be an extra careful from any outside threat. Then one day a woman and her daughter comes looking for food to trade with their valuables. The deal does not go well between them, but somehow they all manage to gain trust and start to live together. Obviously there's always an issue of food shortage, so how they are going to handle and followed by many other troubles brings an end to the tale.\r\n\r\n> \"The only thing I have caught in there walked on two legs.\"\r\n\r\nA minimal cast film with less dialogues, but totally a visual storyteller. I liked the film, but not my favourite, just a fine thriller. The actors are not very popular, but still they are familiar faces and I liked the film because of them. Critically acclaimed and well received by movie goers, but the common people who are vital for the commercial success let it down. It was nominated for the BAFTA awards in the newcomer writer/director category, but did not win.\r\n\r\nThe film's main plot is the food. The human population grown so fast during entering the twenty first century and again fallen rapidly due to the shortage of food which is obviously directly affected by pollution and other issues. So the theme was right, but not everybody gets that message. Because most of who watch it expects entertainment and nothing else. I hope that would not be your excuse to ignore it.\r\n\r\nThe film was shot in Northern Ireland, in a couple of places and its surroundings. It is slow, but steady in what it wanted to tell us. It's not a question about how familiar the theme is, but how different and obviously how different people tackle such situations is what this film focused to tell us pretty dramatic way. \r\n\r\nWhen I say the poster, I thought it was like a native American or south American's story. Mainly because of the haircut that gave the impression like that I saw from other films. The synopsis gave a different perspective, so I found it more interesting than before. Then I watched, with a low expectation after knowing it was not received well. But I surprised and come to know this is not a bad film as they have said. In fact a very interesting perspective on how these three people struggle with what they have got in front of them. I am not saying it's a must see, but definitely not the worst, so I suggest you to do small research if you are confused to try this title. If you ask me, I would say just go for it.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",

         "As a species, us humans have a curious fondness for grim and gloomy art. From skull tattoos to death metal bands, there is an unrelenting fascination with the macabre and morbid, and films are no exception. It's surprisingly difficult to recall a genuinely gloomy film which didn't get inexorable approval. From the true life horrors of Hotel Rwanda and The Elephant Man through to the fictional bleakness of The Road, Nil by Mouth and Tyrannosaur, there is something peculiarly fascinating about watching unrelenting despair and observing the malevolence of humanity on the big screen. Intentionally set in an undefined year of the near future in an indeterminate part of the world, the human population has grown exponentially to the point of saturation; food is at a premium and from the movies sporadic intimations, society has regressed back to packs of hunter/gatherers. The survivalist (as we never learn his true name) has managed to create a small farmstead in the middle of a dense wood just large enough to keep himself self-sufficient. When mother and daughter couple Kathryn (Fouere) and Milja (Goth) appear at his door asking for food and shelter, the survivalist's controlled unaccompanied existence is threatened as his morals become confused; to keep himself safe or to assist his visitor's needs. A sound method to keep costs low when producing a movie is to isolate the action to a restricted area, keep the number of actors limited and construct a simple and focused story line. The risk with this technique is that the movie becomes more of a theatrical production where each moment becomes intensified and less freedom is given to procrastination. It is unsurprising therefore that the lead character is given to an actor with an education in walking the boards. The film devotes a significant amount of time to building McCann's character, devoid of dialogue and with extensive intense close ups. Due to the utter desperation of The Survivalist's plot, it requires total commitment to its audience and at times starts to meander yet manages to pull itself back every time just before the bleakness becomes tiresome. There are enough plot and character surprises to keep the movie interesting, the acting is excellent and the limited scope of environment constantly feels claustrophobic but never artistically restrictive. The Survivalist demonstrates the way, once the whiteboard of social acceptability has been wiped clean, intimacy and sex become acceptable tradeable commodities. The Survivalist is grim, depressing and about the least life- affirming film you're likely to see this year. Yet it is tense, wonderfully acted and a fascinating illustration of the instinctive brutality of humanity's will to survive.",
         "Some unknown disaster has struck the planet causing a severe food shortage, it's every man for himself. The title character is held up all on his own in the woods, subsiding on the meagre scraps he can grow and repels anyone who encroaches on his land. Then a woman and her, rather plain looking daughter, show up asking to trade. The Survivalist, devoid of all human contact apart from the marauders he kills, cannot resist the pull of some female companionship. This film has a very small stage, concentrating entirely on the three central characters. Dialogue is minimal but affective, the Survivalist is especially grumpy and non-communicative. There is a lot of nudity, expect dong shots and people washing their bits in the river and some very grubby sex scenes. The scope of the story is small but the stakes for the characters are high. It has a poke around at desperation and necessity. Would you pimp your daughter out for a bowl of soup? I suppose it depends how hungry you are. Well made, well acted, small budget but clever lighting makes it look gritty rather than cheap. A very good, low octane watch.",
         "This won't be everyone's cup of tea. I however have watched plenty of absolute rubbish and this film is well acted, filmed and written. I'm a big Walking Dead fan and this reminded me quite a bit on it, although more a slower stronger tequila without zombies than the beery dead. The atmosphere is palpable and a lot is left to the imagination as to the whys and whats however the interplay in a low number of characters is pretty intense. You do need to be able to enjoy this kind of thing and there's a lot of subtext social commentary in here, not much is in your face explicit generic movie script that spells everything out. Shot beautifully in Ireland, intense stuff with no laughs, but I thought pretty fresh.",
         "Haunting post apocalyptic tale. Sublimely acted, directed, and photographed. May not be for everyone, but a must for anyone who loves film and is bored of the spate of fantasy and YA dystopian dramas that are all too prevalent. This movie can be seen as both a futuristic nightmare and as a cautionary tale about our wasting of our resources and the dangers that loom. Martin McCann provides the heart and soul of the film in the title role and he is certainly destined for stardom. All the performances are brave and gut wrenching. Given the darkness of the film and its graphic visuals I am not sure if this film can find a wide audience but it is guaranteed to become a festival favorite and cult success.",
         "Extraordinarily well executed, fresh, replete with lots of smart details bring it all to life. The characters are believable; raw and wild, running on their baser instincts, struggling to be civil in a world where gnash-toothed animals survive and civility only gets you dead. They try to be civil! Oh bless their hearts they try. What I loved the most is the transformation you see in the characters; they go from feral, viciously unlikeable creeps to slowly warming up and right before your eyes they bloom into something like humans again, full of love and empathy and hate and greed and loyalty and all the paradoxes of the human condition. The setting is well fleshed out, with enough mystery regarding the details of society's breakdown to suspend any disbelief you might have about the premise. You feel like it's real. The characters further help you sense the desperation and anxiety of the world portrayed here. It's very somatic; you feel the hunger, the distrust, the anger and the violence of revenge. I was left feeling grateful for the world I live in, which is the purpose of theme I suspect. It really could be worse. Watch this movie and feel intense gratitude for your humdrum life. Enjoy!",
         "I overall liked the movie. It didn't try to take on a large topic. It wasn't fun or nice or had a happy ending, just a well told story. Many movies are trying to be more than they are, and this wasn't one of them. It was very well acted and has great visuals. Often times, movie will go for 1-3 minutes without any dialogue, which I found to be an effective way to tell the story. Main 3 characters didn't have any allusions of hope; they were just there trying to survive day-to-day. I am a fan of the Dystopian genre; however, often times, it ends up being unrealistic or trying to a franchise maker. This didn't try any of it, and just succeeded to be a strong movie.",
         "The opening shot of 'The Survivalist' cleverly sets the situation in which the film is set: the camera follows two lines on a graph, one showing oil production, the other world population. While the oil one starts to reduce, the population one continues its dizzying climb (appropriately, the film is set in Ireland, home of the European Union's highest birth rate!) until suddenly plummeting. Thus the scene is set. An unnamed man (Martin McCann) lives in a forest, protecting his vegetable garden from occasional marauders with his rifle, his knife, and his totally naff haircut. This hand-to-mouth existence is disrupted one morning when a mother and daughter appear, seeking to barter the sexual favours of the daughter (Mia Goth) for food. The two women stay and, although suspicious, the man gradually, slightly, lets down his guard - but are the women as innocent as they appear? Essentially a three-hander, at first glance this could make a good play, although live audiences might find their attention wandering during the long periods where nobody speaks as they tramp through the forest, do gardening, or irrigate the crops by urinating on them. But on film these sequences have a quiet beauty (well, not the urination) and, crucially, writer/director Stephen Fingleton - who has won several awards for this work - doesn't over-play them, or drag them out - something of which certain other directors of far more experience would be guilty. The acting is good, with all three leads providing low-key but believable - as far as the circumstances allow - performances. Olwen Fouéré is especially noteworthy as the older woman seeking to manipulate things in order to survive, and McCann provides some good facial expressions that well convey emotions that would otherwise remain unexpressed, such is the monosyllabic speech of his character. Combining human interest with tension and threat, this is a low-budget gem that is well worth seeing if you get the chance.",
         "It's not always about the fittest, but about the strongest - in mind more than in body. And this movie with very little dialog if you made a statistic, as in lines per minute, will not be every ones deal. It just is too quiet and too slow, especially when it sets up the life of our protagonist. Of course there will be inciting incidents and how our main man will react to them. It's tough to say he's likable, but he's pragmatic. And it's also tough to really put yourself into his shoes. because living alone for a very long time makes you see things - differently. And it's really about the way we live in our own world. Even when surrounded by others, we can only tell what we are feeling, not what others think. It's dirty and it never backs out on anything, which you'll either love or hate about it",
         "Definitely a good movie to see. I think the Survivalist says maybe 20 lines in the whole movie but he plays the role perfect. I like the fact that it was hard to predict which direction the movie is going. One thing I am sure everyone hates is to waste their life watching a ridiculous movie that is so predictable where they even throw in bad acting. This won't take you there. At first I thought it was going to be like The Walking Dead but I was happy to see that it was far from that nonsense. The Walking Dead is just another overrated TV show. Enjoy. James",
         "Stumbled across this title and it looked interesting and promising, so I gave it a watch. I made it to the end without getting angry nor finding anything fundamentally wrong with it, so that's a positive for me. I like the way it was filmed, liked the minimal dialogue, liked the pacing and overall felt it was worthy of 7/10. However I couldn't help think that what I witnessed was essentially this: 1. Man is doing his best on his own. Obviously watched and took detailed notes from Bear Grylls and Les Stroud (Survivorman) and has a one man farm in the woods up and running smoothly and efficiently. 2. Women arrive and it all goes downhill for him from there. The moral of the story - Women. Can't live with them, can't kill them. But in this case he could have and should have.",
         "This film is a prime example of how well researched material can take the smallest of budgets, minimal dialogue and a complete lack of soundtrack and turn this into a masterpiece. The viewer is given no background story and none of the characters are fleshed out. There is next to no information on anyone in the film apart from the main character, and even with him, there is very little information given. But that is the point. The strength of the film lies not in the story but the idea of what one does to survive when life goes back to basics. The viewer's attention is drawn to the intensity of the situation, the survival skills that are actual knowledge one needs to survive in the wild. The cold and barren undertone of the film should have been the reason for its failure. Instead, it serves to emphasise the stark and bleak situation that all the characters are faced with. The script does not pull any punches and a strong stomach is needed for some scenes. And if you get the gist of the film so far, then you will already know whether there is a happy ending or not...",
         "I always like to read other reviews, some of the negative reviews would be better watching Transformers or anything where your brain does not have to think. The story is simple and starts quietly showing two lines one oil production and population growth, both head upwards until oil starts plummeting and then population. It could have employed expensive graphics to show desolation but this is not what the film is about. It is about human relationships, as the great Leonard Cohen sang \"I will help if I can and kill you if I must but when it comes down to dust I will help you if I must and kill you if I can\" The acting is superb he three protagonists are wary of each other and the daughter takes a pragmatic outlook on killing her own mother. This is gritty with a capital G, if you do not mind thinking and realise all films are the Bourne identity then enjoy this movie.",
         "SPOILER ALERT (not really an alert as there is nothing to \"spoil\", but hey...) This film can be most positively described as torpid, cinematic drivel. There is no plot (none worth noting) and no real acting, but there are many well filmed shot of the woods, so it gets two stars for cinematography. The costuming and scene sets are laughable. I want Fingleton's brand of laundry detergent, such white pillowcases... lovely. The main character is an uninteresting, incompetent bungler who has been lucky enough to last seven years alone in a post-apocalyptic woods without being killed. He isn't a \"survivalist\" at all and has no defensive skills, rather he blunders about without much of a plan tending to a child's garden which could never support him (designed by people who don't know what a subsistence garden looks like), regularly leaves himself completely undefended (2 shells are nothing), never attempts to find or construct new weaponry or build any sort of defences apart from cans on a string (7 years and he can't make a single spear or trap). He's only alive because he hides. There's hardly any dialogue, which is probably a mercy as there is no real plot; it's all about maudy looks and Fingleton has just one expression, the face of a frightened weasel. (Credit where due, Goth has mentally challenged and bored down pat, what range.) No one is attractive, but they all have good bodies. Perhaps that is realistic in an apocalyptic world, but it's so a la mode to \"fix\" actors with unattractive faces by sending them to the gym, that it grates. I realise that apparently faces are irrelevant these days because audiences find any actor with a well muscled bodies attractive, but they should be able to actually act; of course without lines or a plot, what can one do? When the other \"bad guys\" finally catch the \"survived for a bit by hidingist\" for dinner it's a great relief; at least he finally has a purpose. Its a pity they missed Goth and the script writer...",
         "I don't usually write reviews but must say I was disappointed with this film. It reminded me a lot of the plot from last year's novel \"California\" by Edan Epuki. I think it could have been better with a bit of a rewrite. I could see that it was trying to tell the story with minimal dialogue, but I found myself just waiting for it to end. I also think that it could have been better with tighter editing. There were just so many scenes that seemed to be drawn out for longer than they needed to be. Now I feel terrible for picking holes in this film, which does have some decent acting and an interesting premise. See it if you are into long dystopian films!",
         "Looking at the cover, you may well have high expectations for this film..you see review snippets of .. \"Masterful!\", \"Will shake you for days\", \"Mad Max, in the countryside\". Seeing that Post Apocalyptic films are my favourite genre, I thought I might be about to watch something special. It starts off very slow, but that's OK. You figure they are bringing you gently into the Brutal reality of the world in a curious unsuspecting way, but no. It just stays at a slow pace from there. We are introduced to the protagonists enemies on very rare occasion, which helped break the monotony a bit, but its fleeting, and do not expect anything like the visceral eye feast of Mad Max. A disappointment really, and certainly a bad comparison to make it to Mad Max. I had high hopes of something akin to the UK feel of 28 days later, but this was quite a lack lustre of a film. Have to say as well, there is some sort of weird erotic element to the film. The main actor is well endowed, as they say, and so the director seems to like showing this off in a few random scenes. So out of the blue, we see him walking around naked in his dreams or having a random masturbation session.",
         "It's been a while since I felt that I completely wasted two hours of my life watching a movie. This one did that. Yes, the acting is good, there is nothing wrong with that. But why write or direct or produce a movie that gives absolutely nothing to the audience. It teaches nothing, but presents a totally cynical view of human beings, as if this post-apocalyptic world would turn everyone into these zombie-like creatures unable to communicate with each other, unable to have normal human interactions, unable to smile or have fun. It just shows the writer/director's lack of understanding about life and human beings, and all it reflects is the pessimistic view that he/she currently has about people.",
         "In The Survivalist the world population outgrew the food supply and a decline in Oil Production.In a world were rules no longer apply but you own, what is right and what is wrong is at your discretion, ethics and morals are crushed by the will to survive. This is a world were people use the most extreme measures to stay alive. We also see how the world copes with the downfall of humanity. We look at the life of an unnamed Man living alone in the wilderness, his sole existence focused on his daily routine. We see much stillness and subtlety while we see desolation consumes every minute in his life, even so he is comfortable with his environment, having no desire for any human contact. Until two women (mother and daughter)seeking shelter and food, the protagonist rejects them, having clear antisocial interaction and most likely a personality disorder,until the mother reminds him something only her daughter can offer. They are make a barter so they can stay and help to cultivate and hunt. We realize that he is a very reserved and quiet person his solitude is a way to protect himself both physically and mentally,but he manages to open to them in his own way. At some point he has to save the daughter from another survivalist gaining some of the humanity he ones lost and taking away the selfishness in him, to me its not a heroic act its just a very humanist choice that burst out in him. For me personally that is the subject of this film loss and recovery of a person broken by guilt. I can see some influences from the walking dead, the last of us and the road. Removing the colorful atmosphere surrounding their environment its a very gray world and the inclination of what is good and bad depends on how the characters accept the new world in which they live and the rules they must follow to maintain their humanity. \"You forget what you want to remember, and you remember what you want to forget.\" \u2015 Cormac McCarthy, The Road",
         "I haven't seen such a bad movie for a while! The only thing you hear are people breathing, wind in the trees (that often don't move at all) and pointless discussions. You'll see dead bodies, violence, brutality, etc., trees, earth, mud, rain. It is going nowhere, there is nothing but boredom, it is far too long and will teach you nothing. I was hoping for some surviving techniques, anything, but no chance, you have to endure two hours of void. Ordinary life in the woods with no music, no fun, no excitement, no feelings, no story, just a snapshot of emptiness. And as in all the bad movies, everything is predictable, even the happy end... Total waste of time. The worst is that the actors are good.",
         "Judging by the poster this looked like a great post apocalypse drama. Instead it was a pile of pretentious artsy fartsy crap that moved along at a snails pace and got nowhere. Bloke lives in a hut after some disaster or other and grows food using his own waste. Bit like the Martian but without a script. Some woman turns up with her daughter and offers sex for food and board. Daughter duly obliges and the three settle down to a life of monotony and some sex. Then some dreary dialogue later bloke kills woman to ease her pain as she was dying and then all hell breaks loose as the hut gets invaded and everyone dies I think. Then daughter who survived the slaughter goes somewhere and does something and then it ends. I may be a bit loose on what actually happened as I was half asleep due to boredom and missed a couple of scenes but basically it's another pile of too clever drivel from the art squad who will tell us we are not intelligent enough to understand it and call it a masterpiece. Seen too many like this and am bored with them but am sure there will be another one along soon to stun us with it's brilliance.",
         "The survivalist leaves a lot to the imagination, telling the story of our lead a man who lives out in the wilderness paranoid and alone when his world is disrupted by the appearance of two women. Does he risk his perfect though limited little world by allowing them access to his home or should he turn them away? The Survivalist is a dark gritty tale that pulls no punches, I found myself oddly empathising and relating to the lead and yet at the same time was frustrated by that distinct lack of entertainment value I found. This multi award winning effort simply didn't connect with me and though I certainly appreciate what they were going for unfortunately didn't see the appeal. Credit to the cast, credit to the film makers but for me this made for uncomfortable viewing and a really lackluster finale. The Good: All round well made Strong performances Great concept The Bad: Uncomfortable stuff Certainly niche viewing Weak ending Things I Learnt From This Movie: The survivalist lifestyle isn't as glamorous as others may have you believe Don't let women in your life, they'll ruin everything",
         "There's really no better word for this than grim. At first, it seems a brave film - with little dialogue, flawed characters, & almost no plot to speak of. But none of those elements pan out into anything remotely interesting; the silences aren't better than more dialogue might've been, the characters don't develop any complexity (you can't root for them but neither can you learn from them or respect them or empathise with them much at all), and the plot that isn't seems unrealistic (he's not even a good survivalist). Strip away anything remotely ~edgy~ and you're left with a thoroughly ordinary narrative. It's reasonably pretty, though, so 2/10 for the trees.",
         "Initially I was hoping for a true gem never seen before. Instead, I spent my 104 minutes of life, on Friday night might I add, watching a guy surviving for SEVEN years in a forest looking like where I played hide and seek when I was 6, not being able to harvest more than 2 square feet of land. If you call that surviving, then I am an astronaut! After seven years he was so \"evolved\" that he actually caught a rabbit with a bear trap! How impressive and skillful. I am willing to accept a bet: place me in a forest with a pocket knife and leave me 7 days and I will catch you a bear instead. Why would anybody be called a survivalist without trying to be a part of the society? More suiting attribute would be a lunatic. P.S. My review contains more sentences than the entire movie. Considering there were 0 effects included (except the 2 dead rabbits and a gummy penis) I find that extremely disappointing. P.S.S If that was a real penis, I honestly hope those weren't real rabbits. Shame on you! P.S.S.S. Why is the lowest grade 1? What happened to the beauty of zero?",
         "Well acted it maybe But it drags like a post apocalyptic existence Oh! that's what it's supposed to be One minute the Mother and daughter want to kill him The next they're saving him I'm trying to fill 10 lines on what is in essence a monosyllabic movie Characters are very dull. Very, very little action Storyline, hardly any PANTS. Basically confusing. The best thing is the beginning credits which were cleverly done. Steer clear. Unless you are very patient. Ahh think I've got it. Boring. It definitely won't shake you for days, well maybe in anger.",
         "Since when is another end of the world film wreathed in such grand and glowing accolades? Plodding, brutal, pointless, and way too much breathing and spoon in bowl noise. Really? Interesting seedling germination process The actors did their work. This review is really against the stream, as the critics that get paid for opinion, raved. No spoiler stuff, but if the story is ridiculous, and the characters are created out of a comic book setting. A good drama would have a lot to overcome, and this work can't deal with the level of emotional intensity it wants to display in such a setting. It becomes farce, not drama. See through the morbidity, the degradation, the paranoia, the filth, and the cold, and there is simply nothing really there for the viewer to take home. Poor vehicle for the attempt to demonstrate yet another look at the downside of the human condition. Rabbit stew, anyone? Mind the mushroom sauce. As always, this review is worth exactly what it was paid. The film is so complex and difficult to create. The actors especially were subject to a rough go,surely,and curse the critic who sits in a chair comfortably granting the world august opinion on the work others do. Apologies. The need to write was fueled more by the pointlessness of putting so much energy into such as this than the finished product. This film is in a group of sad, depressing, similar works, expressing our ability to degenerate into exactly what we are now, only a lot more deprived, dirtier, and having the freedom to kill each other without the buffer of legal control. This has become a critique of subject rather than content. If an educated society desires such, perhaps this is, in itself, a critique.",
         "While it appeared as though this film would be an interesting view to help kill some time on a Saturday afternoon, the lack of 'anything' made for probably one of the most boring movies I have seen in a very, very long time. The lighting and camera angles were all off and the scenery, or lack thereof, was also - boring. If you are into staring at the same room with a few shots of the front yard of an old shed for 2 hours, then by all means, rent away and enjoy. Otherwise, there is no plot. Oddly enough, the producer decided to throw in a pornographic scene showing (in slow motion and in full view) a man masturbating. I can only assume that the director thought that 60 seconds of raw porn would boost ratings? I don't know and I don't care. I am just happy that I might help someone else avoid the torture of watching this dull waste of time flick. Ridiculous movie."
