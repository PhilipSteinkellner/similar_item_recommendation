         "content": "> Trapped underwater in a pod and battling to the survive.\r\n\r\nI might be a little harsh with my rating on this, but I had my reasons. The film theme was not bad, pretty fresh, but the screenplay was not developed to its full potential. I know it is a low cost film with a limited cast, so I respect the production quality which really was better than what I expected, but the story was way simple and predictable. If it was a more edgy type, would have had best chance to impress the viewers, because there are lots people who take chances on small film like this.\r\n\r\nIt's a 'trapped' concept. You can call it an opposite to 'Gravity'. I mean that story takes place above us and this one below the sea water. I did not anticipate to that level, because I knew it's limit, yet not very convincing. The other reason is there are lots of awesome B movies with innovative ideas I have seen where this film narrowly failed.\r\n\r\nThis is a story of the diver's team who went to fix the damaged underwater pipeline gets trapped in a small pot after losing all the contact with their ship. So the team of four battles to survive in a hostile condition, especially the oxygen is their main concern till someone comes to rescue them. That's the story which reveals what happens to them in its 90 minute narration.\r\n\r\nThe cast and crew's effort must be appreciated, because shooting some 30-40 per cent of the film underwater is really a tough job. At the beginning it looked promising, but later on it did not stay that way, especially the end was a kind of let down. It is a fictional tale, nothing like 'The 33', otherwise even for an ordinary story that inspired by a real event gets our sympathy. I don't think it is worth a watch, unless you got lots of spare time and want to pass it, then it would make a decent timepass film.\r\n\r\n4/10",

         "I have just watched the Movie pressure, which I was actually quite looking forward too. However, having now seen it, I can only say it was quite disappointing. I could not believe how technically incorrect it was, it even failed at the most basic level. Saturation divers at a working depth of 650 feet do not breath air as was not only stated several times during the film but also on the DVD box cover and claimed by the Director in the bonus clips on the DVD. Saturation divers breath a mixed gas of Helium and Oxygen which is approximately 97% helium 3% Oxygen. They do not refer to it as air, they refer to it as gas. If the Director of the film cannot even establish the most basic information to be technically correct then it is no surprise that the story line and script was so weak and such a washout. Even the end seen showing the survival of the baby diver of the group is complete nonsense, this would have resulted in an explosive bend which would literally have blown the young man's body apart. There was an incredible amount of technical inaccuracies in this film far too many to list here. This combined with an incredibly poor disjointed weak script should really have confined this movie to be left sunk at the bottom of the ocean. If you do want to watch a movie about saturation divers that get trapped at the bottom of the sea in a diving bell that is technically accurate, is a claustrophobic and nerve tingling drama with a good story line then I recommend you watch the English version of the Norwegian made film from 1989 called The Dive (Dykket in Norwegian). I would not recommend anyone to pay money to go and watch Pressure.",
         "Pressure is an example of how to make a small scale movie right. Put several characters on a predicament and let them resolve the increasingly dangerous issues with nature and probably each other. The movie is set nearly exclusively on one location, yet this claustrophobic environment is showcased with rich visual, even sometimes ironically beautiful. The cast, though small, has enough drama for an engaging thriller. Story follows four men who are tasked to fix oil pipeline on sea bed. This is a very risky job since there's a storm brewing and sure enough, they find themselves trapped underwater. With pressure differential, amongst other lethal problems, they have to work together to ensure their survival. The plot offers healthy amount of realism with its taxing physical condition as well as human nature in jeopardy. Surprisingly, the simple setting and premise are effective in creating tension. Characters are decent, each of them has their own vice and these make the already volatile situation escalate. Delivery from the actors are nice, coupled with good pacing, the dynamic between them feels natural. It is quick on introduction and doesn't prolong the scenes needlessly, making the desperate men appear more identifiable. Graphic is not the usual sea oriented or submarine movie, it's in fact quite pristine. The overall tone is painted with blue tint, it eases the sense of dread in sophisticated way. Some of the scenes have outstanding cinematography so the audience won't be lost despite the murky surroundings. A minor obstacle is the movie use to specific lingo that might confuse casual viewer, but majority of the time the dilemma is expressed with adequate simplicity so it can easily capture the thrill. Cleverly implementing fast pace, good characters and clear visual, Pressure makes the modest premise into an engrossing voyage.",
         "This was not a movie I was really interested in seeing. Four guys trapped in a submersible bell vehicle during a storm. Sounded like it would be boring. In truth, it wasn't the type of genre I'm interested in. However, they did a very good job. The acting was awesome, and it seemed realistic as to how people would behave in such a situation. The production value was good, as was the cinematography. It didn't look cheap or CGI to death. The movie did tend to have a claustrophobic feel, as a real life situation would. There is nudity. The young man is dreaming or having a hallucination, and a girl swims up to him, and she's totally naked, and you see everything. I recommend this movie. I gave it a 7-star rating. I doubt I'll watch it again, but it was surprising that they did such a good job on the movie.",
         "I did not enjoy this movie for the price of $6.99 The plot is predictable and shallow, the acting is subpar, and production felt thrown together like it was made in a Olympic sized pool with little thought given to making it feel deep, dangerous, and under pressure. Flashing lights in the \"bell\", shaking camera work, character development jumping around forcing you to care about their pasts like it matters ( it doesn't) and all the way to the end felt like 100% cliché. Don't waste the cash on this one, wait for it to come on the local cable. Im not a critic, but I watch 2-3 movies every single night.. I made an account just to review this movie and warn others that it is not worth spending money to watch. It is NOTHING like the Abyss, and far from Black Sea ( and I didn't exactly love that one either, but Id watch it twice over this once). I predicted everything that happened in this movie, rolled my eyes nonstop and said out loud several times.. how is this film $6.99!!??",
         "This movie was part of my B movie genre one afternoon. I usually am not the thriller type, I typically prefer more action adventure oriented (Deep Star 6, The Abyss etc...) There were elements that reminded me of Das Boot. However I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed it. The Good: The acting was surprisingly good, the script writing was good, the effects were good. The Bad: The plot is a little predictable at times, but this is just an adaptation of Lifeboat. Character development could have been a little better, I didn't feel as invested in any of the characters as I felt I should have. Generally I did enjoy it, I probably will not watch is again, but I would recommend it to anyone",
         "This review contains huge spoilers. Saw this movie in hope of a thrilling claustrophobic experience. But this was a disappointment. First of all the plot feels thin. Why is there a oil pipeline on the ocean floor outside Somalia? Why would a ship ever have thrown anchor in these pirate infested waters?Then the real crimes against the laws of nature begins. One of the divers has brought a bottle of shampoo in to the diving bell. A bell where there are no visible reasons to bring any hygiene products at all. When starting to descend another diver warns him about the risk of having it explode! because the increased pressure in the bell. That would of course only make the bottle less likely to leak. But the moment after the diver opens the lid and gets sprayed with shampoo. When finally ascending they argue about the risk of the bell not being capable of handling the shift in pressure. Most likely, the bell will be okay with a decreased pressure. Like this the movie goes on with total ignorance of what is realistic in a deep sea adventure. Just a waste of time in my opinion.",
         "This movie is not terrible, it's empty. It is a low budget one, where not much happens and the little that happens is stretched into an hour and a half of length. It seems more a movie for television then for the cinema. You do not enter into the role of any character and there are no major twists and is also fairly predictable. With a little more development it would be more interesting. However, while not completely boring and while having a minimum of (uninteresting) suspense, I can not recommend it, unless you've just nothing else to see. The real nice thing to watch here is the movie poster. 5/10",
         "In the Somalia coast, the veteran divers Engel (Danny Huston), Mitchell (Matthew Goode), Hurst (Jones Alan McKenna) and the rookie Jones (Joe Cole) are assigned to repair an oil pipeline on the bottom of the sea by the Vaxxilon representative Karsen (Ian Pirie). They are advised that a storm is coming, but the Diving Support Vessel Lorimer lowers the bell with the team. They succeed to weld the pipeline but the storm comes and the vessel sinks, killing the whole crew. Short of the oxygen, the divers try to communicate with the surface and the leader Mitchell keeps the hope that they will be saved. But will the oil company send another vessel to rescue them? \"Pressure\" is one of the most anguishing and realistic drama about the deep water divers ever made and economical interest of oil companies. The performances are top-notch and the realism of the scenes is impressive. The director Ron Scalpello makes an excellent film that keeps the tension along 91 mm running time. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): \"Sob Pressão\" (\"Under Pressure\")",
         "\"Pressure\" concerns a group of men (Danny Huston, Matthew Goode, Joe Cole, and Ian Pirie), who are submerged in the depths of the Indian Ocean in a small submarine to replace an oil pipeline. However, once their submarine malfunctions, the crew are separated from their base and stuck in the deep waters with no connection to their base and oxygen levels running dangerously low. To survive, the men must conserve their energy and their air in hopes that a rescue team hasn't completely abandoned them in the ocean. \"Pressure\" is one of the first films in quite sometime to have the gall to take place in one setting, effectively trapping the audience, much like the characters, in a tight, claustrophobic space, giving the audience the feeling of helplessness and peril. The great thing about these films is they open rely on tension and character development being that the setting isn't changing, so new environments and interactions aren't always being set up. The downside to this, however, is that when films to choose to focus on stunted dialog and lax character development, these films generally begin to become uninteresting. Such a thing happens with \"Pressure;\" we have four characters, two of which played by veteran actors, and not a shred of human interest to be found. The characters predominately speak in stunted expressions about wanting to be rescued or argue amongst themselves, and when we do begin to learn about their own personal histories, there's little in the way of conversational realism to attach us. The film does feature some very nice effects work, specifically on the water and the atmosphere engulfing the ship. The waters are a lighter indigo-color, murky and unrelenting, and scenes when some of the men venture out of the submarine in attempt to swim to shore really exploit the capable effects work in this film. Director Ron Scalpello also manages to create some discernible intensity with the film by having medium-length, extreme close-ups on the faces of the trapped men inside the submarine. While \"Pressure\" make lack narratively, and have little to grip one in terms of human interest, there's at least a commendable focus on the aesthetics in an attempt to try and create a tense setting. Above all, however, the real bother is a serious lack of any character to root for or invest in, which makes \"Pressure\"'s slender runtime of eighty-eight minutes rather grueling to sit through. The characters are almost entirely vapid, the tension is sporadic and sometimes wholly ineffective, the pace finds itself simultaneously working in a slowburn and a slam-bang manner, and the overall impact is middling to say the least.",
         "This low budget British thriller does disaster on a small scale. It's a single location film in which four divers find themselves trapped on the ocean floor in a diving bell when the oil operation they're working on is hit by a storm, sinking the vessel above and leaving them stranded and with their oxygen running out. It's a great set-up and one that thrilled me with awe, but sadly the execution of this film is less than stellar and fails to get the right balance of sympathy and suspense. With the constant bad language none of the characters are very sympathetic and most get on your nerves after a while. The film's failure can be laid directly at the door of the writer, who fumbles the premise after a solid first half an hour. Certainly the experienced cast members, including Danny Huston and Matthew Goode, can't be faulted, although the dullest character (played by Joe Cole) unfortunately gets the lion's share of the screen time. PRESSURE is thrilling at first but as it moves towards the end, the tension should really be mounting but instead the story seems to slow down and devolves into various fantasies experienced by the main characters. I don't want to watch any of this mindless filler, I want to see the protagonists fighting back against impending death, and only Huston seems to do this. In the end, it's a missed opportunity.",
         "If you have an average intelligence, you will notice all the typical plot lines, written according to a very strict template. You know immediately that there will be an accident. You know who will be involved. You know WHEN it will happen. You know that, of the group of people in the involved, only ONE will survive. You also know WHO that person will be. If you are a person with average intelligence, you will simply fast- forward to check your assumptions, and find all to be correct. This movie doesn't take more than 10 minutes to \"enjoy\". Acting and directing was good, but the awesome predictability of the plot is an insult.",
         "This is an unknown film with not such good reviews from audiences and critics alike. But I watched it because I like locked room stories/mysteries, and the fact that it was set hundreds of feet under water, where the pressure is tremendous and oxygen only what you find in your deep sea diving suit and the submarine pod, made it a must watch for me. This is a locked room suspense, submarine movie. Unless the characters behave stupidly and start killing each other, I don't think anything can go wrong with such a story. And I was right. Right from the get go, this took me with the deep sea divers down under water, and kept me there. In a way I was stuck with them, trapped with them, and wanted to see what will happen next. The basic plot is four deep sea diver are sent in a small pod to fix an oil pipeline on the sea bed. It's a high risk job as a storm is brewing in the skies. Soon they find themselves trapped underwater and retreat into the small submarine/pod which has only so much oxygen for them. So as the characters are trapped they understand, the lesser the number of characters alive, the more the oxygen for them. So if the other trapped character was to die in an accident they would be able to live longer! But what happened next wasn't what I was expecting. It's certainly not about characters killing each other. Instead the second half of the movie is thrilling and emotional as we begin to root for the characters and want them to come out of this dire situation alive! It may not be a big blockbuster, it may not have A list actors, it may not be factually correct about deep sea diving, but it is certainly a good story, with an edge of the seat climax! Rarely does a film take you away from your comfortable chair, and comfortable life and transport you into a different, dangerous, unknown, unseen world. This is one of them. In spite of the flaws, this is a must watch for the setting, suspense and the story.",
         "Perhaps even more than planes, submarines (or similar vehicles) are perfect for thrillers. The idea of being stuck in a few rooms underwater, running out of oxygen, with only a thin steel shell between you and the cold black sea, is inherently suspenseful. I cannot think of a really terrible submarine flick - it takes an impressive lack of talent to waste this scenario. Pressure is... decent. It does nothing novel, makes a few missteps, but it was interesting enough to hold my attention. Four divers are trapped in a pod at the bottom of the ocean, with only a few hours of oxygen and an ugly dilemma: do they just wait for help (which may or may not be coming), or instead risk their lives (and more oxygen!) to attempt a dangerous escape. The most interesting character is veteran Engel, played by Danny Huston as someone who is competent but not infallible. Sadly, he is saddled with a rather hackneyed backstory. At first we get brief creepy flashbacks with a young woman covered with blood - it turns out she was his girlfriend (never mind she looks like she could be Huston's teenage daughter) who died in a car crash. Engel then let the other driver (who caused the accident) drown along with his family. Guess who is looking for redemption now? It's overly melodramatic stuff - to make it even more heavy-handed, the kid in the car looks like the youngest crew member, Jones (Joe Cole). Speaking of Jones, he is involved in another portentous scene, where he hallucinates and sees a naked woman who, mermaid-like, at first kisses him, then bites him viciously. It's fairly silly. The more realistic scenes are better - like when Mitchell (Matthew Goode) finds himself among a swarm of jellyfish. Of course, Jones reveals his girlfriend is pregnant. What's up with rookies and their partners in submarine movies? The recent Black Sea did the exact same thing. And the young officer in K-19 also obsessed over his girlfriend; Bon Jovi in U- 571 had just been married... It's becoming a bigger cliché than the old cop on his last day of work. Still, Pressure is watchable. The submarine thriller/drama formula is pretty much foolproof - if not quite waterproof. *drum roll* 6/10",
         "I wasn't sure what to expect - I watched it without knowing very little about the film. Let me say it didn't disappoint! It has a very similar feel to \"The Abyss\". Saying that, I don't think it was as good as 'The Abyss', but still very good for those who like deep sea movies where misc problems cause human life to be threatened. At the bottom of the ocean it almost feels like one is as far away as outer space. When things do go wrong it seems there's no one to help. And oxygen is always an issue. In this movie, the 'mothership' sinks in a storm while 4 men are trapped in a small sub welding a broken oil pipeline. Unlike The Abyss (where the data & oxygen cord is disconnected before the storm), the main ship sinks with the cord attached making the small craft unable to reach the surface as the cord keeps the sub just below the surface. Lots of excitement, believable acting, and great effects make this film work. Great edge-of-your-seat action that won't disappoint!",
         "I thought the movie was better then some of the reviews on IMDb make you think. Okay it might be boring for someone who expect to see a lot of action and a lot of different locations but the story is about men trapped in a small pod underneath the ocean so you can't expect anymore then that. To me it's all about the suspense that you get by watching their desperation and the way they try to find a solution to get them out of this very bad situation. And the least you can say is that they acted well. I could feel the claustrophobia, the anguish and despair. There's absolutely no way I would ever put a foot in one of those pods. So to me it was a better movie then I expected. It might not be the greatest in this genre but it certainly did the job to keep me entertained on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",
         "Honestly it's a good film , is it blockbuster no but definitely underrated and definitely one of the better movies on Netflix , if you've watched all the best movies on Netflix and can't find nothing worth you're while this is a good film to give a try",
         "In the Indian Ocean, a diving bell with a crew opts to make repairs with a storm coming. S@#t happens and it becomes a fight for life among a crew that doesn't always get along. The acting was Goode, but the storyline grew old. I can only take so much drama of people trapped in one place. This is a drama/thriller and not a horror. Not much more exciting than the cover art. Guide: F-bomb, FF nudity (Gemita Samarra)",
         "I was very pleased - much more than I anticipated - by this piece of cinema. The basic premise has been done before, of course, but the idea of applying it to the world of saturation diving teams is a good one. We all depend to some extent on these people but how many of us are aware of the work they do or the intense levels of teamwork required to live their life? This film opens our eyes to something little-known. The concept is supported by a fine script, realistic development of both situation and character and excellent camerawork. The film creates a genuine feeling of being drawn into a normally closed environment, but with enough use of technical references and the like to remind us that this a life which is alien to most of us. The actors do a very fine job of portraying a mix of hope and despair, confidence and frailty, friendship and tension. Its an beautiful job all round. This is a very human and touching piece of filmmaking.",
         "As a retired commercial diver, this was hard to watch. While I don't expect them to get every detail right, they almost didn't get any details right. Its awful. I could list hundreds of things. First up on the descent, it takes hours and hours (about 4 from memory) to get to 660 feet, not an hour. His shampoo explodes because he does not take of the top during decent, and while you would do that, it would actually implode on the way down. Just saying. No such thing as a big bell and certainly not with two rooms to it! Helium costs big money, so they make bells as small as the can. Never seen a 4 man bell myself, but even so, it would be as small as a 3 man bell. They did bother to do ''bell checks'' on which the survival suits are listed (which they find missing when they need them) . Sever the umbilical to the ship, you lose hot water, which they try to reflect in the diving with the divers being very cold, but forget to tell the viewer why the divers are cold. Lose hot water, and you have no heater, as that is how they work! They use the sound powered phone for most things, when you have direct comms to the bell over the speaker/microphone and no bell I have ever been in, could possibly have comms to reach a ship. In fact it is one of our biggest problems. You come up with perfect comms from diver to topside, bell to topside, bell to diver and diver to diver and you would be an over night multi millionaire. So far I have not really had to much in the way of a spoiler, but I am about to now , so if that is a problem, read no further....... *spoiler alert* When they try to float the bell, there is a step by step you must take and one of those steps is to use the umbilical cutter. Its a manual hydraulic cutter operated from inside the bell. If you don't cut that, you likely wont get far. So these people didn't bother, get caught up and have to basically free swim the rest of the way. So from memory they go from 660 feet to 250 feet or less them open the door (you need to equalize pressure first) them out and up. Arh, NO! You would never make the surface alive and I do not know how you would even be dropping that pressure to 250 feet. I mean that is going to hurt bad and kill you also, but might take some time. But either way, you are not going to be alive when you hit the surface. Very lazy film making, very lazy indeed",
         "\"Pressure\" is neither a great movie nor a bad movie; there are both some good things about it as well as some not so great things. First, the good things. Director Ron Scalpello does manage to generate a good taste of what it must be like to be down in the ocean in a cramped, cold and dark environment, and he manages to handle what had to be limited funds to make a movie that doesn't come across as cheap. Also, he makes the movie click along at a good pace so there are no slow or boring spots. Now, the not so good things. While Scalpello makes a good-looking movie, he does stumble in on aspect: There really isn't a high level of tension or suspense despite the fact the characters are facing possible death in just a few hours. In fairness, some of this may have been to the way the characters are scripted. The characters for the most part act alike and are not terribly interesting. They also seem to take their predicament much better than you'd think. I realize they are professionals, but some sign of human weakness would have helped considerably. To sum up, I've seen better... but I've also seen worse. Wait to watch it until you can see it for free on a slow Sunday when you can't find anything better to watch.",
         "I might be a little harsh with my rating on this, but I had my reasons. The film theme was not bad, pretty fresh, but the screenplay was not developed to its full potential. I know it is a low cost film with a limited cast, so I respect the production quality which really was better than what I expected, but the story was way simple and predictable. If it was a more edgy type, would have had best chance to impress the viewers, because there are lots people who take chances on small film like this. It's a 'trapped' concept. You can call it an opposite to 'Gravity'. I mean that story takes place above us and this one below the sea water. I did not anticipate to that level, because I knew it's limit, yet not very convincing. The other reason is there are lots of awesome B movies with innovative ideas I have seen where this film narrowly failed. This is a story of the diver's team who went to fix the damaged underwater pipeline gets trapped in a small pot after losing all the contact with their ship. So the team of four battles to survive in a hostile condition, especially the oxygen is their main concern till someone comes to rescue them. That's the story which reveals what happens to them in its 90 minute narration. The cast and crew's effort must be appreciated, because shooting some 30-40 per cent of the film underwater is really a tough job. At the beginning it looked promising, but later on it did not stay that way, especially the end was a kind of let down. It is a fictional tale, nothing like 'The 33', otherwise even for an ordinary story that inspired by a real event gets our sympathy. I don't think it is worth a watch, unless you got lots of spare time and want to pass it, then it would make a decent timepass film. 4/10",
         "This is a compact movie about a few divers that get stranded on the ocean floor while attempting a repair to some pipelines for a company. The scenes feel like they are ripped from a theatre play - well set, brilliantly acted and intense without spelling out the drama for you. By contrast to, say, The Martian, with a similar subject, that has also been released this year, this movie focuses more on the suspense, psychological depth, human sacrifice and well, I guess, they nailed it: pressure! Since it is an UK, dare I say, European production, the feeling that this movie gives you is way more profound than what a cheesy Hollywood could deliver. The \"acts\" are carefully planned: I kept looking to see how much of the movie is left over, fearing that at some point they will get bored with it and start speeding it up. However, the movie paces slowly and carefully and it is quite balanced! There is a recent trend taking place in cinematography where the distance in time between the intrigue, exposition and outcome are unevenly balanced - for example, there are movies that take a long time to get to the intrigue, then rush the exposition and offer a very short outcome, etc... Pressure on the other hand seems to pace evenly amongst them which makes it a very pleasant movie to watch as well as making it a memorable film. Compared to a famous similar movie \"The Abyss\" (1989) that aims to be somewhat more extravagant and follows a good narrative typical of an 80s/90s Sci-Fi production, Pressure seems to be the realistic counterpart where the rough corners remain unbrushed and delivered to you raw. Pressure seems to lack the spelled-out Romanticism of Hollywood productions but it is still present in the scenes and lets the viewer digest it on their own without blatantly explaining it. I would highly recommend this movie - the beginning is a tad bland, but it does not waste time, and the minute the intrigue is spelled out, you will be irremediably hooked. Nota bene though, if you are after an action packed story, with CGI imagery this may not be for you. However, due to a masterful execution, strong production and excellent acting, the movie may just as well stun, shock and terrify you at certain moments.",
         "Thought this movie was great and worth watching. Enjoyed the diving aspect of it (as I am a ex-diver, but not that deep!) and it was pretty exciting. It's worth watching. This is a very general review, as I am currently distracted... The plot was good, could likely happen even in this day & age, and seemed fairly factual to me. The overseas environment rang true from my actual experience in Asia. The older guys used their experience to try to teach the younger guy, but it didn't often rub off and the younger one made up his own mind in most circumstances. Seemed to be typical behavior, even nowadays. Through it all, danger was present which needed educated and/or experienced decision-making, and even those didn't work, which sometimes in the end did not work out well, unfortunately. If you want to find out what happened, watch the movie! :)"
