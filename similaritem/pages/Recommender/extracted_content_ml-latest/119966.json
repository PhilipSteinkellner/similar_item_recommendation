         "content": "> Haunted by the past, and so refusing to sail on.\r\n\r\nThe most of the people does not aware of this movie's existence. The only reason I went for it was Brittany Robertson. She's been around, but for the first time I noticed her in a major role was in 'The First Time'. Ever since I kind of liked her, so I had no reason to skip it despite whatever the response it got.\r\n\r\nBased on the book named 'Undiscovered Gyrl'. After finish watching this I felt the original title should have been borrowed instead, because that seems veracious to the narration. The story of a 18 year old girl who decides to blog in a fake name to hide her identity from family, friends and other known people. Because she wanted to write the whole truth about her life, especially to share her dark secrets. But is it safe to let the world know what kind of person she is?\r\n\r\nThe main character was confused between sex and relationship, and so the way it gets us as well. Mainly because of her haunting past. When it enters the final quarter, you probably won't remember the earlier events. The screenplay is not being perceptive, but had a bold plan to bring the curtain in a style. It was an unexpected twist that will make you go awe, but the biggest relief is it was only a fictional inspired by the reality of the internet culture the youngsters live-in everyday.\r\n\r\n> \"It's like we all want to be famous,\r\n> even though we're not good at anything.\"\r\n\r\nFrom her all the major characters so far, this one was the best Britt ever got to express deeply. The plot relies too much on the sexual journey, but there's no strong and disturbing scenes other than a couple of nude scenes. That does not approve teens to watch it, except the matured ones. Because of the movie theme I was hesitating in the initial parts and because of the ending I kind of liked entire film. One small twist changes the viewpoint of the whole narration. Remember, it perfectly imitated the web world as well.\r\n\r\nThe whole film was like a mathematical problem where one character stand in the middle and connects with four others directly. It's not going to solve it, but gives the formula to you do it and ends hinting with many possibilities. It does not make sure viewers understand it, but either way everything you predict is right as well as wrong. The significance of the storytelling was clear, that is to be a practical about the questions that never answered in the real world. You have to take all the clues and put together, because it all connected to main character's childhood. But still debate remains at the conclusion and so that is the way it is.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I did not like the movie from the beginning till the final scene. I thought it was better than the average, certainly not a bad movie. But after the movie, between the watch and this review, during recollecting bit by bit about the movie's purpose, I realised it was being rational in many perspectives, about social media and its safety. This film equals to the those real stories, all the credits must go to the author who is also the screenwriter and director of the film. I feel it is underrated, if you are a regular blog reader of mine, then you may know when I say definitely not to miss.\r\n\r\n7.5/10",

         "This movie seems light and easy on the surface...engaging and entertaining, but there is so much more depth to the movie and the characters than what appears at first blush. The main character, a teenage girl seemingly lost, takes us on an introspective journey through our teenage years, our early adulthood, our complicated marriages and all the important and complicated relationships that influenced each of those stages of our lives. The characters are intricate and smart and multi-layered. The book is even smarter! I rented the movie after reading the book and I loved them both so much that I may need to read the book again and re-rent the movie! Highly recommend both!",
         "I had no idea what to expect when I sat down to view \"Ask Me Anything\". It occurred to me that this would probably turn out to be a fluffy, sensitive chick-flick and that I might walk out after a little while. My male ego often feels unable follow the psychological estrogen trail for too long... At the movies, anyway. I mention this for all the male readers because I was truly blown away by this little movie. It deserves to have little or none of its content revealed. I will mention the package: nicely written, surprisingly engaging, considering how modest and devoid of ambition some of the dialogs can deceivingly appear at the start. The picture is deeply candid and offers genuinely potent insights into cinematic gender language. It is fresh! It took me by surprise and wrapped me around its little finger in no time. Walking out? Out of the question! The style of the picture is discreet - it allows some very subtle performances to come across. Britt Robertson, the lead, deserves accolades. She is a superb actress - deeply vulnerable. What's more, she has a unique quality for an actress: she makes her protagonist fascinating long before we've even begun to get acquainted with her crisis. The film left me speechless. In a good way.",
         "First of all, I would like to make it clear that I have not read this book, nor did I see any previews for the film before I rented it. I was very interested in the journey of the main character as a young and somewhat promiscuous girl coming out of high school, and trying to find herself and deal with her many issues through the use of an anonymous blog. I actually would have given this movie about a 7, UNTIL, I was completely blindsided by the absolutely ridiculous PSA that was tacked on as a twist ending. Those last 5 minutes ruined the entire movie for me. I thought that the story of this young girl dealing with her demons and coming to terms with how difficult and confusing life can be was honest and easy to relate to. However, there is absolutely no reason that this story needed to take such a drastic turn into some type of abducted girl/murder mystery in literally the last 5 minutes of the film. Please do not misunderstand me, I love a good twist! However this was in no way good, or added anything positive or interesting to the story. In my opinion, the ending felt like some poorly made public service announcement, warning parents of the dangers of social media. Granted, those dangers are real, but this was an awful way to portray them! Not only did this character's change her own name, and the names of everyone she wrote about, there was no evidence that she wrote about where she lived or worked. Furthermore, none of the 3 men that she became involved with during the course of the film, she met online. Therefore, what the hell was the point of adding such a ridiculous, and honestly deflating, ending to an otherwise interesting movie!? I am aware of the danger of creating this alternate life online, but I do not feel that in this particular case, it made any speck of coherent sense with the rest of the story. I rated this film a 5 because I did like the main character, and felt that all of the actors involved gave a good effort in their performances. However, if I could rate the ending only, it would receive a something like a -2, and that's being generous. I blame no one other than the writer/director for this lower score.",
         "***Spoiler Alert*** First, let me say that I have NOT read the book. For all I know this could be a perfect adaptation of the book. I watched the movie because I like Britt Robertson, a decent young actress who seems destined to play teenagers her entire career, and it has a good supporting cast. The movie seemed pretty straight forward while watching. A 'coming-of-age' story about a young woman who has some serious flaws. After investing an hour and half in this young woman's story, the movie is turned 180 degrees with a voice-over by the mother in the last 5 minutes. So, the entire tone of the film was totally abandoned at the end with this out-of-the-blue coda. It left me wondering, what is the point of this film? Is it a polemic about stranger abduction? A warning to parents to watch your kids? I do enjoy films with unresolved endings. But I hate films that end with a total twist. It is like watching a murder mystery, only to discover that the perpetrator is a character who was not introduced during the entire story.",
         "I'll spare you a full review. I just have to say that it was a pretty good film, right up until the last few minutes. The film jarringly switches gears completely, presenting itself as if the film and the negative ending were a true story. It's not. So why pull such a cynical switch-er-roo? Slut shaming? Slut scaring? Self sabotage on the part of the writer / director? An effort to side step away from the idea that an 18 year old girl can own her own sensuality? Maybe some combination of the above? It not only ruins the film, but it really exploits the tragedy of real girls and women who go missing in order to provide a self indulgent \"twist\" ending. Totally unnecessary when the actual film was rather good.",
         "If, like me, you instantly recoil at the thought of listening to teenage angst narration and/or female coming-of-age first world problem melodrama, persist with this one. The film's beginning is deliberately deceptive. It's an interesting take with a subtle darkness that's worth the time, and the mystery is back-loaded (Usual Suspects-style) into the last ten minutes. It's similar in theme to the magnificent \"White Bird in a Blizzard\", but sadly lacks the structure to give it the same mounting discomfort. The main problem with the piece - and i suspect it comes from the original book, which is written as blog posts - is that it seems it would be more strongly packaged as a foreboding suspense thriller, rather than the way it's been predominantly presented as a coming-of-age drama: darker, more vicious, and more twisted. What's lack is a sense of dramatic irony - in this case, you need a foreshadowing of the tragedy that's coming to keep you hooked, but the hook only comes when you've invested all the time to watch til the end. The payoff isn't quite there. It plods, rather than builds up. SPOILERS AHEAD - if you need the reason to persist past the first impression: This film is about an previously-abused teenage girl who has become pregnant, and mysteriously disappears without a trace after receiving threats from confessing all the secrets of her promiscuity on an pseudo-anonymous blog. The story and characters are ultimately fantasy representations she's writing about (as she's changed the details she's put out publicly), and the real-life people are revealed at the end: all the people we see are from her imagination, and/or ours. You have a girl who has been abused taking on all the subtle narcissistic traits of youth, swimming amongst other perceived selfish companions, reflecting on the millennial preoccupation with recording everything online without considering the consequences. The central driver of the entailing mystery seems to be cyber-bullying (from talking about planning to have an abortion publicly on her blog), but not much attention is paid to it - odd, when you consider her mysterious disappearance at the end is hung on it. Personally, i'd have thought the hardest-hitting finale would have been a reveal of the nicey-nicey sex offender boss having killed her, but it's entirely left open (it's implied she's dead, although we don't know). That would certainly have hurt to watch and been a killer twist. The lead (Robertson) is fantastic, and carries herself incredibly well next to some serious heavyweights who are well placed. Overall, with a stronger, layered structure and unraveling pace it could have been a real masterpiece. Not that anyone should want films to be too obvious, but in this case the \"mystery\" vagueness is too foggy to punch the story home with a bang. Usually you want a film to be faithful to the original book, but on this occasion, it doesn't translate well to screen without a stronger story arc for the medium: 3 acts of \"observational\" material doesn't give you the right impetus a twisting film plot needs. However, it's definitely worth the time to savor what it could have been, if you can get past the idea of what you think it probably is.",
         "Katie Kampenfelt (Britt Robertson) is cheating on her boyfriend Rory with the older Dan Gallo (Justin Long) who has a girlfriend named Martine. To her mother (Molly Hagan)'s dismay, she's deferring college for one year. Her counselor suggests that she write a blog. Her father (Robert Patrick) is a drunk ex-sports writer. She gets a job at Glenn Warburg (Martin Sheen)'s bookstore. Her mother's boyfriend Mark finds out that Warburg has a criminal sexual past and she's forced to quit. Then the Spooners (Christian Slater, Kimberly Williams-Paisley) hire her to be their nanny. Jade (Gia Mantegna) is her best girl friend. Joel Seidler 3 years older from school keeps calling. This story needs somebody to streamline the myriad of characters. If the older flings can be combined, it would allow them to be more compelling characters. There are so many characters vying for screen time that the movie becomes scattered. Also the early light tone is off-putting especially with the promiscuous girl. It's not a sex romp and needs some dark seriousness injected into it early on. Britt Robertson is an interesting young actress who keeps this movie on track. Then there is the final reveal. No spoilers. It's a fascinating turn but one that has little foreshadowing. I wasn't looking for a reveal and it's not as compelling. By comparison, a great reveal like Sixth Sense has a ton of clues.",
         "At first, I thought this movie would be some silly chick-flick that ended with your typical love story or something similar, but it was nothing like that. This movie is modest and deep at the same time. Ask Me Anything kept my attention very well throughout the entire movie, not once did I want to shut it off or feel I was wasting my time. I was engulfed in the movie. Partially because I can relate to the main actress in the movie with wanting to take a hiatus from school after high school (I never did though), and liking older men. I also happen to like movies or stories with relation to the online world, feeling hidden online or just keeping a secret identity. A lot of people could very much relate to this situation or feelings, including myself. It kind of gives you a look into the world of a slightly promiscuous or curious, rather, younger female after high school. They picked a great actress to play the main role, not only is she gorgeous and fit the part well, but she just fit into whoever this character was supposed to be, and it worked. The movie was not just centered around her online journal life, but her past, her relationships with her not so perfect family and other friends, but other people she happened to meet who don't have oh so bright pasts or present lives! It held my attention well and kept me asking what happens next... The ending though, I was not a fan of. I figured it would have a good closing or something that left me wondering (which it did, but in a bad way). Basically it kind of shuts off after the end and cuts to clips of a woman writing on her daughters online journal (IRL main character??? Not sure if this was based on a true story... ) reaching out to her readers, saying that one day her daughter received a call that lasted so and so minutes, got into her car, drove away and never came back. Haven't seen her since. The movie kind of draws you in to this character with a messed up past and confusing life, and by the end you're wondering if she figures it all out. You get no answers about anything. She gets pregnant, no idea if she gets an abortion or keeps the baby, no idea who the father is, no idea what happens to anything. It made absolutely no sense - just kind of left you high and dry and you're like ... okay, what? It was not one of those good endings that left you wondering, although it DOES keep you wondering, it's just like in a way that leaves you feel cheated because there should have and could have been a better ending. It didn't really make sense to me. Otherwise, it was a pretty decent movie overall and would probably watch it again after awhile, and suggest it to someone else!",
         "I happen to stumble upon As Me Anything because of my love for Christian Slater and films normally featuring a cast my age. This movie grabbed me the minute it started (the soundtrack is excellent). On top of an amazing cast, this movie felt completely authentic. Its extremely hard to find something original anymore, that actually makes you stop and think. The main reason I fell in love with Ask Me Anything was the reality of it. Yes, I loved the story line, but the actual detail in both the book (Undiscovered Gyrl) and film were what sealed the deal. When Katie is standing in front of the mirror with makeup all over her face, or when she over reacts to her mom, the way she runs from store to store looking for jobs, or the slightly inappropriate jokes she makes to Christian Slater on the first phone call. They are REAL. Real emotions and actions of young adults, and that was so refreshing. Most movies and TV shows today that feature young adults might be fun to watch, but they aren't realistic, its not how people in there late teens act or speak. This film is startlingly raw and true.",
         "I really liked it and this could have been a box office hit ... or at least a indie movie one. Movie Channel is showing it this month. Not mentioning any spoilers but the ending is sad and but almost expected. Great acting by cast and Britt Robertson/Christian Slater. I'm very picky with OVERRATED movies/TV, so try to trust me when I say this movie is a keeper. Okay, so have to add more lines (JESUS) ... young woman played by BR ends up having issues with many relationships / promiscuous to several men who are typically older than her and / or married. She struggles through life and realizes or may have realized some of these issues may have come from past sexual abuse. She is remanded to seek therapy by her mom but she's in denial about her issues on and off and ends up doing something that jeopardizes her safety. Refer to the ending. Cheers."
