         "This is neither a detective story, nor an 'unmasking drama' à la Ibsen. Hence, you will miss little, and may actually gain something, if you know in advance how the movie will end, and what is the underlying background of the events. Not until closely before the end will the grievous dilemma be revealed. The husband of the seriously mentally ill middle-aged Icelandic woman (Loa) is a latent alcoholic. Whenever Loa leaves him, he submits to his addiction. And whatever additional feelings Loa may have for her husband, one set may best be compared with those of a mother for her child. When she is at home, she is living a (rather?) normal life, going to her monotonous job and performing well, taking care of her children etc. I said a 'rather' normal life. We will see her taking her husband's head in her hands with real love. But there is no scene in which she TALKS a single word to him. - - - Sometimes Loa cannot stand this state of things any longer, and just runs away. During one such tour she was eventually found in England and send back to the small volcanic island, distant from the capital. During the tour connected with the present movie, she ended up in a mental hospital in France, without identification papers and apparently being mute. With one exception, no member of the staff got the idea that Loa might not be French. - - - There is a wealth of movies about a single idealistic psychiatrist fighting against the prejudices of all colleagues. I am no clinician, but I am a professional expert as regards the theories of the field. Most movies of this variety consist of unethical propaganda. Usually, the theories and approaches of the 'idealist' are conclusively known to be harmful to patients. It is an admirable fact that in 'Stormy Weather' no psychiatric theory is presented, discussed, praised, or attacked. The young female psychiatrist (Cora) is simply a genuine idealist. Since the first task is to establish rapport with Loa, some of the patient's 'whims' must be accepted. For instance, Loa likes to go up and down in the lift. Quite a few persons are needed for drawing her out of the lift at the hospital. But Cora takes her out in the town, finds a glass lift on the outside of a really high building. And while they go up and down Cora talks incessantly. This is not the only example of unorthodox procedures. - - - Unfortunately, Cora's suggestion that the patient might not be French made the chief doctor engage Interpol. Loa was soon identified, and during Cora's day off she was sent back to Iceland. However, now follows the extraordinary idealism of the young psychiatrist. She immediately flies to Iceland. The local inhabitants take for granted that Cora is a tourist wanting to see the volcano which recently had an eruption. There is even a scene when Cora eats dinner with Loa's family. The husband explains everything that a tourist might want to know about the volcano. Wisely, Cora and Loa give no indication of knowing each other, until they are alone. Loa is prepared to follow Cora back to the French hospital. Unfortunately, the local doctor happens to see them on their way to the boat. He knows nothing of psychiatry. There is only one psychiatric hospital in the entire country, and only extreme cases are sent thither. The local doctor prevents what he perceives as 'criminal kidnapping'. Hence, Cora's attempt ended as a complete failure. - Cora is excellently played by Élodie Bouchez, and this may well be her best performance so far. - - - You will need empathy for being able to appreciate this sad story. To some people, such deadlocked situations constitute a part of the reality they must face. - Apart from other merits 'Stormy Weather' also proves that the set of topics upon which films may be made is far from exhausted. There is still room for unexpected innovations.",
         "saw this film at the toronto int film fest. it was a little on the slow side but i find it is staying with me much more than many of the other films i saw. the potrayal of iceland shows a locale that is bleakly beautiful, forbidding and lonesome. i was especially taken with the performance of elodie bouchez. her portrayal was controlled but intense - i was drawn in and did not want to take my eyes off her. worth a look.",
         "Very well acted by Elodie Bouchez and particularly by Didda Jonsdottir, Stormy Weather shows a course of psychiatric treatment that fails when the psychiatrist falls into a variety of the mutism of her patient. They achieve emotional rapport, but it's not clear how treatment would have proceeded, since the doctor (or intern?) was using French to address the silent patient, while it appears, after the patient has been transported back to Iceland, that English is the most common second language there. Was the illustrated nasty weather and volcanism of Iceland the cause of the patient's condition? Let's hope not. Could the doctor have left some therapeutic hints with the woman's husband and the local general M.D.? She might have, but she's becoming a patient herself.",
         "Icelandic screenwriter and documentary and narrative feature film director Sólveig Anspach's second feature film which she co-wrote with screenwriters Cécile Vargaftig, Pierre Erwan Guillaume and Roger Bohbot, is inspired by a newspaper article she read regarding a mysterious eighteen-year-old who was found in France. It premiered in the Un Certain Regard section at the 56th Cannes International Film Festival in 2003, was shot on location in Belgium and Iceland and is a France-Belgium-Iceland co-production which was produced by producer Patrick Sobelman. It tells the story about a psychiatrist at a hospital in Paris, France named Cora Levine and her communication with a new acquaintance. Distinctly and subtly directed by Icelandic filmmaker Sólveig Anspach, this quietly paced fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the two main characters' viewpoints, draws a substantially reflective portrayal of a person who crosses ethical boundaries by intervening in the life of a person she thinks she can help. While notable for its dense and majestic milieu depictions, reverent cinematography by cinematographer Benoit Dervaux and use of sound and colors, this character-driven story about people like all of us who are the way they are without there being any simplistic, if necessary or if any whatsoever reason for them being as they are, a non-fictional community where people are accepted as a part of the whole and who actually is helped when someone who regards themselves as of superior intellectual and emotional intelligence chastises the independence of a human being, imposes one's compassion and attempts to invade into a person's mind with the altruistic intention of curing that person from the person he or she is, depicts two humanely perspicacious studies of character and contains a timely score by composer Alexandre Desplat. This calmly conversational, down-to-earth and densely humorous indie from the early 2000s which is set in France and Iceland in the 21st century and where a person who lives in an internal silence where words are unspoken is driven to confide to a stranger who has more empathy than knowledge, is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure, subtle character development and continuity, the noteworthy acting performance by Icelandic poet Didda Jónsdóttir and the significant acting performances by French actress Éloide Bouchez and Icelandic actors Baltasar Kormákur and Ingvar E. Sigurdsson. An internally poetic, cinematographically atmospheric and resonating reflection on the human mystery.",
         "Sad, and very well acted. A young French institutional psychiatrist gets wrapped up in the life of a patient \u2013 a mute middle age woman, who seems to have no identity. One day the woman disappears, and the doctor follows her to a small island off Iceland, where it turns out she has a husband, a child, and even a job. They know she's disturbed, but they just deal with it as part of the way things are. This pushes the psychiatrist to ever more obsessive behavior, as she tries to get the woman back to France to continue treatment. The first third \u2013 the woman's treatment in France, and the growing doctor/patient relationship is the strongest part of the film \u2013 mysterious and touching. On Iceland, things feel a touch more predictable, and the young doctor's near madness seems a bit of a stretch. But the culture clash is still fascinating. A film I'm glad I saw, even if flawed.",
         "I've seen many films like this. Nothing happens, just 80 minutes suffering. Oooh, can you feel the pain of the main character? Oh, yes, but I really don't care. The director couldn't wake up my solidarity. If you want to see this movie, then just for the nice Icelandic landscapes. They are really great, i have to admit"
