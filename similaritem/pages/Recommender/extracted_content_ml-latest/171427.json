         "this is about a country man who wants to marry his long time love but her stubborn greedy father will not give her up unless he pay a very high dowry. So he heads to the city to make money honestly but after that does not work he tries a hand on scheming and stealing but mucks it all over the place. this movie captures the ignorance of country people and the corrupt style of city life. but more so it is saved by the funny performance of the legend, Kemal Sunal. Yet the best part of the movie is probably the end when the small country boy ends up showing he can overcome many obstacles. Overall i would give this movie a 6/10 for its storyline but a 10/10 for its comedy.",
