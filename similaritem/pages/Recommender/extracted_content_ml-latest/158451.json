There are a number of Latin American films dealing with their maid phenomenon out there. A rising generation is mining the experience to great enjoyment of the movie masses in parts of the world where this type of home employment is not common. This is a great entry into that subject matter. I particularly liked the light humorous substrate throughout the film which saves it from its own darkness and gives it an air of Moliere type play played out with all the trappings of authentic scenery and great acting."],
