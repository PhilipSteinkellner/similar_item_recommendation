         "Bodybuilding is fascinating. There's an unspoken camaraderie among those who eat, live and breathe bodybuilding. Just like in Pumping Iron, the champion, Phil Heath is depicted as the villain and like Lou Ferrigno, Kai is the hardworking underdog. Ben Pakulski is sort of the \"Ivan Drago\" of this docudrama. Dennis Wolf has a particularly awkward comedic scene and Roelly Winklaar is absolutely hilarious. I am so glad the director, Vlad Yudin did not show Branch Warren shouting swear words and throwing weights. The plot is really all about Kai vs Phil. To people unfamiliar to bodybuilding, the footage of the other bodybuilders can seem out of place since the audience doesn't get to form any type of connection with them. They do touch on anabolic steroids but it is very limited. \"Bigger, Faster, Stronger\" is a better documentary for that but it is nice that they do mention it instead of ignoring the elephant in the room. I follow bodybuilding very closely so a lot of the content seems redundant, but I still gave this a ten just because I love bodybuilding. It's great to see that somebody is at least trying to break it out of it's shell and I support that 100% percent. Bodybuilding is such a niche market and outsiders have such a close-minded opinion of it that I highly doubt this film will make much of an impact but I sincerely thank Vlad Yudin for the effort. P.S. It was quite amusing seeing some of the gigantic audience members trying to get comfortable in the seemingly tiny movie theater seats.",
         "Interesting look into how things have changed in the world of bodybuilding since the cult classic Pumping Iron came out. Overall, the film was well shot and edited with a fairly in-depth look at some Mr. Olympia hopefuls. Overall the movie is more of a commercial for bodybuilding than it is a balanced documentary. However, it was definitely worth watching. The elephant in the room is the fact that genetics, nutrition, and exercise science haven't changed enough over the past 30 years to make these guys look like something out of a comic book. They are taking steroids....lots of them. There is a plethora of medical evidence that steroids cause deleterious effects on the body, which the film acknowledges. One could argue that all professional athletes are using them, but bodybuilding is different. You HAVE to use steroids in order to compete, and there is no real effort to prevent there use. As a physician and a longtime weightlifter it pains me to see so many people pursing this hobby/sport at the expensive of their health. Most of it boils down to money for advertising and supplements. Overall, an entertaining movie, but a painful reminder of what bodybuilding has become.",
         "Sugar coated boring tale that answers no questions that matter and answers loads of questions that don;t matter. Ludicrous opinions are not challenged by the director such as Ben Pakulski's comment (suggesting it's not about chemicals) \"you couldn't do what I do\" BS, a friend of mine trained for 8 years natural and had 16 inch arms, he took roids within 12 months he had 21.5 inch arms and 7% bodyfat, so yes we can ALL do it EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US, the only single question is to what level of personal safety are we willing to risk, the more you are willing to risk the bigger you will get, and what separates us from them is an unwillingness to risk our health, nothing else, the less respect you have for your own life the better bodybuilder you'll be. Then Phil Heath comes in with another unchallenged piece of pure nonsense \"we are a tiny percent of people who can build muscle and lose fat at the same time\" yes that's because steroids enable the body to do that, HGH does too very effectively, tyroxin and other thyroid drugs, insulin, etc etc etc. What was that? is he in denial? self deluded? just google Kevin Levrone before and after, 90% of the whole sport is about chemicals, with 1% genetics, 1% hard work and a final 8% for diet. Which is fine, but do the documentary properly or just don't do it at all.",
         "This was a very interesting documentary, very well put together and you feel you're following these people on their journey to become the next Mr. Olympia. Mickey Rourke as narrator adds a nice touch to it. This is not simply about muscles, it's about what it takes to get to that level and what drives them! It has a nice human element to this which makes you feel for the people you're watching, you see the pain they go through and whilst I'm not an avid supporter of body building you have to give credit for such sheer dedication. It's not a controversial documentary, however nonetheless it kept me entertained and hopefully you'll find it a very pleasant watch too :)",
         "A documentary that follows top bodybuilders as they train to compete in the Mr. Olympia competition. The trains of bodybuilding and righteousness can't be stopped and their movement brings about reactive forces in the people they affect. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. Other than that, it was an okay film, and I would recommend that people watch it. It's an amazing work and everything I had hoped for. From an artistic standpoint, it holds its own. With good narration from all involved, I have to give this one a final and well deserved rating of 7 out of 10, so check it out now.",
         "The look of the modern day bodybuilder is not attractive to me at all. Too big, too cut, too tan, just too much of a good thing to the point where it becomes a bad thing. I never understood why in the world anyone would want to pump themselves up into something that huge. This documentary does a really good job in showing the human side behind such an extreme sport. It chronicles the journey of a handful of Mr.Olympia hopefuls and why they do it. You get to see pieces of their lives, the way they prep, they way they interact with their families if they have them, or how they spend time on their own if they don't. The contrast between all these men defies the bodybuilder stereotype. One is a painter (a damn good one at that) in his free time and sort of a philosopher, the other is no-nonsense and uses science lab equipment to track and map out his progress, etc. Everyone has a story and it's nice to see a human side to the sport, when the contenders all have a physique that separates them from most of the population. The whole reason behind those seemingly ridiculous poses and the tan is explained too in a sensible way. It's an interesting peek in an industry that's not very mainstream. The more controversial topics like steroids are barely touched upon, and I liked that. This documentary is about the people more than anything. Mickey Rourke's narration is very fitting as well.",
         "First off, I must say that this movie is not very entertaining. I had to watch this movie in three sittings because I could only make it through about 30 minutes without busting out my iPad and surfing the net. It does not capture your attention and bring you on a journey like Pumping Iron did. I lift regularly and get into bodybuilding every few years so I wanted to check this out. The last time I was into it Ronnie Coleman and Jay Cutler were having their rivalry so it was good to see who the current generation of guys are but really that was about all this movie was good for. It wasn't really entertaining. To be honest, it seems like they tried to cover too many guys and there wasn't enough time to really build a story. Obviously the showdown is between Heath and Kai but not much extra time is devoted to it. Maybe if they took a cue from Pumping Iron where 80% of the movie was about Lou vs. Arnold, they could have had something good here as Kai and Heath seem so different. I did really like Kai after seeing this film. The dude looks like a beast but to see him that he eats at home with chopsticks, does performance art on the streets and in the subways and paints really impressed me. He is definitely a renaissance man. I agree with the other reviews here that gripe about the lack of steroid coverage. The movie is not an expose so I get why they didn't say much but when you have Heath claiming that only the bodybuilding community knows how to build muscle while losing fat and the blonde bald guy in Tampa saying the same sort of stuff, it seems the director should have called them out on it. Instead you get a shot of a syringe in a dorm room fridge with Mickey Rourke saying that everyone refused to talk about GH and steroids and then Arnold saying that the reason no one is aesthetic anymore is because there no just using roids like back in the day but a lot of other drugs which allows people to get really oversized and super shredded. Other than that, nothing much else is said. Bottom line: Only watch if you are into bodybuilding. Even then you'll get bored but it is still pretty interesting. 5/10",
         "I have been training since 2009 and during these years i have gained a lot information about bodybuilding. How to train, what to eat, what supplements to use etc. The movie is mostly honest, it mentions how important to train hard, how important to follow a proper diet, how important to visualize and it finally talks about steroids. However the answer for the BIGGEST question still remains unanswered. Why is it worth it? Branch said during an interview: \"It's all worth it.\" They just keep saying this well known sentence but there is nothing behind the words. Why are these people working out? What is their motivation? What helps them to move on? How do they overcome the hardest situations? What sacrifices do they have to make? How do they manage their time? etc. They talk about dedication and passion but they don't expand their thoughts. They should have explained this very carefully to the skeptical audience, who view this sport from only one direction. As far as i'm concerned Mike Pulcinella's \"Day in the life of Kai Greene\" is a perfect example of creating an accurate documentary which achieved so much more with a lower budget. Some previous Mr.Olympia were interviewed but unfortunately their screen time were less than 5 minutes. It was a bit disappointment because Jay, Ronnie or Arnold would have deserved more time. The competition between Kai and Phil is implemented to the screen very well and it is funny to watch them in the beginning of their rivalry. They used the same pattern from Pumping Iron, Phil was the confident champion who shows no sign of fear and Kai was the underdog who does everything to knock out the current king from his throne. Narration of Ricky Rourke in the first 10 minutes was a bit weird but later i got used to it and it filled out the empty space. Visually the movie is unexceptionable, photography and cinematography were flawless, editing was great, music absolutely harmonized with happenings and every minute was the evidence of professionalism. In spite of the missed message it is a great documentary to watch, however the target audience (bodybuilding fans) will be the only one who can appreciate this attempt.",
         "I have never owned dumbbells, I haven't done a push up in years, and going to the gym for more than two days in a row has always seemed impossible to me. Still, I have always found really fascinating the fact that some men are willing to go through all sorts of sacrifices and physical tortures just for the sake of getting bigger. The movie takes us on a journey alongside several bodybuilders who are training to participate and become the next Mr Olympia, which is the maximum price in the sport. For a person who knew absolutely nothing about the guys portrayed in the documentary, I was actually surprised to see some of them doing so well and driving Bentleys and Mercedes cars. I guess that the sport and the interest of sponsors has evolved a lot since the eighties when my cousin had bodybuilding magazines with Lee Haney on the cover or the times when the great Arnold was given a 1000 dollars check in prize money. What hasn't changed is the determination to be bigger, leaner, and more muscular than any other man on the planet. They had ridiculous looking bodies then, it's even worse now. The one thing that this documentary fails to answer is why they do all this in the first place? Are they the most egotistical and vain people on earth? Are they trying to prove something, to escape something, or are they just another genre of athletes who happen to like bodybuilding like I could like table tennis, or karate? I still haven't got a clue� In any case, I sort of enjoyed it even though I could not care less about the subject. So whether or not you have an interest in this sport or way of life, it should make for a good enough watch.",
         "Is there a saying (that I don't know about) that goes - \"The bigger your muscles, the bigger the man you are.\" (?) - 'Cause after watching \"Generation Iron\" I'm convinced that this very saying is what's behind driving these over-ambitious bodybuilders to pump themselves up like total balloons. I really do. Yeah. These Hulk-like power-lifters, and such, have convinced themselves that by looking like the Michelin Man on steroids, they, in turn, are gonna be perceived as being the absolute epitome of total manliness. I mean, what else could it be? I really don't know. Please don't get me wrong here. I've certainly got nothing against anyone doing some sensible exercising. I really don't. But, for the life of me, I just can't comprehend (even the slightest) the mindset of these bodybuilders whose determination to develop their muscles to such fantastic proportions is (from my perspective) actually bordering on the obsession of a total fanatic. It really is. Like, talk about muscle-mania to the extreme. And, hey, speaking about performance-enhancing drugs (aka. steroids) - I don't know for sure if taking these sorts of stimulants is directly connected with hair loss, or not - But, from what I observed here, 90% of these over-developed dudes were, in fact, bald, or certainly getting that way soon enough. Anyways - From this viewer's fairly dissatisfied perspective - I found this documentary DVD (concerning 7 very determined rivals all eagerly preparing for the 48th \"Mr. Olympia\" competition in Las Vegas) to be only marginally entertaining, at best."
