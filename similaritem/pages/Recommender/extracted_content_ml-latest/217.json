         "... the plot isn't even that interesting, just some soft-core pornography dressed up in amateur psychology. The structure is lazy, the performances done on autopilot, and the suspense virtually nil. All of this I was expecting, however, and NONE of this was WHY I was watching. It promised us Alicia Silverstone in her first vaguely steamy role. Is it steamy? Not really, but Alicia is cute enough fully CLOTHED for the guys to only feel mildly annoyed that she doesn't whip 'em off. If you're expecting a great film - or even a good one - you'll be disappointed, if you're expecting a raunch-fest - disappointment again. If you just want an excuse to ogle Alicia for roughly two hours, it does its job. Finally, what was J.T Walsh doing in this?? It represents a blight on what was a fine career. Maybe he was duped into expecting sex scenes with Alicia too...",
         "Alicia Silverstone is so pretty, so good, I hope she gets some decent material someday. This film wasn't very good. Miss Silverstone was good, but the film could have really used some more exposure (wink, nod). At least she did spend a fair part of the movie in a bubble bath, but she seemed to have a flesh-colored towel in there when she was moving very much. I will have to give some credit to J. T. Walsh and Lee Garlington as the Tuckers. It was fairly fun to watch them get more and more hammered at the party. I've heard that drunkenness is difficult for an actor, but these two made it quite believable. Overall, this film is of interest only to Silverstone fans, (real ones, because she does NO nude scenes here) Grade: D",
         "\"The Babysitter\" is a bizarre, repetitive and often campy turkey. Most of the film consists of endless fantasy sequences that are never as steamy as they are supposed to be. A fine cast is totally wasted, especially George Segal, whose role couldn't be more pointless. This movie was misconceived all along and is worth watching only if you're curious.... (*1/2)",
         "Has neither the style nor the substance to make it a cult classic. An erotic thriller without any traces of sex or justifiable nudity. Jennifer, the babysitter is an one dimensional person without any depth or insight or even any symbolic meaning. The Babysitter(1995) has a good premise that wasn't explored deeply and the fantasy scenes are bland and surreal less. The Babysitter(1995) is a film that would be much better in the hands of someone like a Luis Bunuel, Nicolas Roeg, Terry Gilliam, or a Abel Ferrara. J.T Walsh's performance is so good that it belongs in a Luis Bunuel Movie rather than this terrible excuse for a motion picture.",
         "...so it's hard to believe anyone is checking out THE BABYSITTER for her lisping, nymphet presence. What you have here is low-grade, late-night, Cinemax fare trying to capitalize on Silverstone's ability to come off as Lolita to a reasonably capable cast of old pros like George Segal and J.T. Walsh (along with one of those London twins for youthful good measure). This kind of a film needs some sexual momentum to keep it entertaining; and, sadly, this movie is lacking in eroticism...Silverstone more so.",
         "saw this movie when i was in grade school on the action channel. sliverstone did show her breasts in this movie, the reason it was cut is because there is nothing there to write home about. otherwise the movie was interesting, had a kick ass soundtrack. 'the lie still in the garden' song rocked. jeremy London and the other dude were hott. i just felt bad that the father was arrested at the end. i felt that mark had it coming. the only twisted part was when the little boy was asked by alica to wash her back. but a fanasty, not reality. her character was stupid and so was jeremy's. it was weird seeing the guy that played mark as a tough guy.",
         "The Babysitter is about this beautiful babysitter(Alicia Silverstone) that everybody adores and has every day fantasies about her. One night, while she is babysitting for the Tucker family, her boyfriend Jack(Jeremy London), her ex boyfriend Mark(Nicky Katt), and Mr.Tucker(J.T Walsh), all want to seduce the babysitter and make their fantasies come true. The plot was alright, i mean, the fantasies were pretty realistic in some way. We all have them at some point. But it gets kinda boring and predictable after a while and the babysitter turns into nothing special. I would give The Babysitter 6/10",
         "\"The Babysitter\" is about as imaginative as its title (both appear to have been recycled). It's just one of a handful of low-profile movies Alicia Silverstone made before her career took off. Here, she's a solemn, sexy-in-spite-of-herself teen trying to earn some bucks by babysitting, seemingly unaware that she has male teenagers drooling and male adults fawning. Uneven drama with ham-handed flickers of surrealism. Executive produced (for some unknown reason) by Joel Schumacher, who later directed Silverstone in 1997's \"Batman and Robin\". This one is strictly amateur night, despite a good supporting cast including George Segal and Lois Chiles. NO STARS from ****",
         "The Babysitter hasn't got much in the way of a plot. It explores the mind of (but not limited to) members of the male sex at different ages. This is concerning their sexual fantasies and advances towards a beautiful young girl, both when they are sober and more so when they are drunk. The men involved include the husband, his young son, the babysitter's boyfriend and his old 'God's Gift' friend.",
         "I first saw The Babysitter when it was released all the way back in 1995, and it still holds up well today. This sleeper stars Alicia Silverstone as the babysitter, who is the obsession of many males in the film. Mr. Tucker (played by J.T. Walsh), the father of the children she babysits, lusts after her, as does her boyfriend, Jack (played by Jeremy London), and a neighborhood rebel, Mark (played by Nicky Katt). Based on a short story by Robert Coover, The Babysitter goes like this: After refusing a date with Mark, the babysitter goes to the Tucker residence on a Friday night to babysit the three children there. Jack is reading Catcher in the Rye in a diner when Mark comes along and begins to coax him into hanging out with him, which leads to the two of them spying on the babysitter while she is looking after the children. The Tuckers are at a party but Mr. Tucker finds any excuse to go home, much to the dismay of his wife, Dolly (good performance given by Lee Garlington) who herself fantasizes about Bill (played by George Segal), the party host. Many of the characters consume alcohol, and the combination of booze and their own obsessions leads to a deadly climax. The Babysitter contains many dream sequences which may be difficult to discern from the actual happenings if you are viewing for the first time. All of the players in this movie do a great job. It is very different and I recommend it."
