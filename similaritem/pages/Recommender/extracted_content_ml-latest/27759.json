         "Take a number of Finnish art students and an ambitious exam project combining some major genres of action films: horror, western, war, spy thriller and space adventure built into one storyline and then try to make a feature length film with no time, no funding and actors working for peanuts; then you will get The Book of Fate. Considering the above-mentioned factors the result is not as awful as could be expected, I have seen numerous films made with much bigger budgets by professional crews that were worse by far. The idea behind the film: creating a framework for action sequences in different times and different settings is interesting although not worked out well enough. Most of the hand to hand fighting sequences are not well done, they might have worked better in slow motion. Other parts (the shooting fights mostly) were not that bad. Other than that the sets and the effects were reasonably well done. If the inexperienced main cast had had more time to get into their roles (the inexperienced director might have done a better job) and the supporting veteran actors had put in more effort, the story would have been more believable. In all, I would not suggest you build your evening on this flick, but if you have the choice between this one and reality TV shows, you might want to opt for this \"fan film\" product.",
         "I think this movie was fairly good when you think that this was as far as I know graduate work for some filmography students from Tampere polytechnic. For that I would give this movie grade 9. But as for commercial release on other hand I must place this below mediocre movie for apparently not so professional end product. But they show lots of potential for future though. Plot in summary: Priest finds The Book of Destiny(Kohtalon Kirja) and ends up to adventure in time to save whole universe. This movie mixes many types of movie genres in rather interesting way. Maybe we will see version made with big money some day ;-)",
         "A couple of months ago my friends were talking about the new Finnish fantasy film Kohtalon Kirja. I have to say that I did not expect much from the movie, but I also didn't expect anything this bad. There is absolutely nothing good to say about the film. The acting is terrible. Even the famous Finnish veteran actors sounded like amateurs. Visual look of the film is beyond description and the soundtrack had some worst heavy metal music I have ever heard. But the real reason I hate the film so much is the action. It was obvious that many of the actors had no training in any martial art. Even the most basic training would have made a big difference. All the moves in the fight scenes were slow and painfully clumsy. This film isn't even funny as a bad trash movie. It is just bad. Avoid it like a plaque.",
         "Kohtalon Kirja makes a grand attempt of featuring almost every genre of film 'not' inherent to the Finnish Movie Canon. While the makers are to be commended for their efforts the result is a lot less than the sum of its parts. Kohtalon Kirja is an episodic movie where each story ends at a cliffhanger which is resolved by the film's end. Despite the level of effort in ensuring the high production values and the support of, undoubtedly, some famous Finnish actors the problem with the film's plot is that it feels very indifferent. The same goes for the actor-performances which all lack any sort of genuine emotion. At its best the film is perhaps even slightly farcical and definitely over-dramatic and entertaining. At its worst it feels like a joke which isn't nearly as funny as the film-makers intended. A film worth watching as an ambitious experimentation in Finnish film-making, but one which falls short of the dynamic of Jade Warrior or the energy and craft of Star Wreck.",
         "Okay, so it isn't the Epic Finnish Movie Spectacle of 2003. It isn't Art with capital A. But who cares. Judging all measurements, this movie should be a turkey. The whole idea is so patently ludicruous that This Movie Just Can't Be Good. Shameless mixing of genres, unexperienced moviemakers, and, good heavens, Tony Halme. But surprise surpise - for some reason, this thing was watchable. *Very* watchable. Sure, it looks a bit cheesy here and there, might have needed some extra care at some times and places... but overall, the lasting impression I got was that This Isn't A Gigabuck Hollywood Movie But It Sure Looks Like One. But then again, I like movies that knowingly play with cliches of the genre, or genres in this case. Running jokes rule. And obviously the makers have had fun, which has to count for something... People seem to severely dislike the special effects - and I think this is unjustified, it's just amazing that they did it *this* good with *that* sort of money. And the plot wasn't *that* bad. Honestly. Cult classic material. Definitely. As a movie: *** As a parody of Hollywood: *****",
         "Film students' graduation movies are often somewhat rough around the edges and suffer from low distribution, but sometimes there are gems to be found among them too. A good example would be Jukka-Pekka Valkeapää's beautifully enigmatic The Visitor (2008), but Tero Molin and Tommi Lepola's epic genre-crosser The Book of Fate is well worth a watch as well. Much larger and expensive a production than an average film school graduation work, The Book of Fate tells the story of a mysterious cosmic book written long ago by an ancient race of powerful beings. Once thought to be lost forever, the Book has now been located on Earth and keeps appearing in various places in different eras of history. The story is divided into five segments: an 18th century vampire horror flick, a stylized western, a gritty Winter War portrayal, a modern techno-thriller and a futuristic science fiction finale. Each segment is about 15 minutes in length and stars recently graduated acting students Juha-Pekka Mikkola and Johanna Kokko in various roles. All the stories are concluded at the end, and the priest character from the first segment makes dream-like appearances in the other stories as well. It is obvious that the writer-directors Lepola and Molin are very familiar with the conventions of the genres they utilize in their story. The ultra-cool gunslinger with no name and the quiet, tense stand-offs and shootouts of the western segment are clearly influenced by the legendary Dollar trilogy by Sergio Leone, while the present day agent thriller plays out like a mash-up of James Bond plot lines and the suave style of The Matrix trilogy. The grainy black and white Winter War segment evokes memories of the legendary The Unknown Soldier (1955), often considered the definitive war film in Finland. When the film's tagline is \"repetition is the mother of learning\", it is obvious that the movie has been written with a wink in the eye, so strict demands for originality are not reasonable here � The Book of Fate is basically five genre movies in one. The fragmented nature of the narrative allows the filmmakers to demonstrate their aptitude for very different styles of presenting a scene. The lighting, cinematography, camera work and music change from one segment to another, always staying true to the traditional style of the genres covered. I especially liked the yellow and sepia tones of the western segment and the cold, stark colours of the present day scenes. The martial arts and the gunplay in the agent thriller are also pretty cool and decently planned, even if not as smooth and fast as in \"real\" big budget actioners. The bright white glow of the final segment on an isolated space ship is pleasing to the eye as well, but the gloomy vampire tale at the beginning feels a bit too dark at points. Also, the black and white photography of the Winter War scenes could have been starker, although in a way the grayness enhances the realistic atmosphere. Besides the aspects mentioned above, the diverse sets deserve a nod too; the film cleverly utilizes existing locations (such as the yard of a roofless church, the Särkänniemi amusement park and the Wild West village in Ähtäri) to cut corners in the set design budget that could have otherwise grown very large. The costumes and makeup are very well created too, particularly in the western, thriller and sci-fi segments. Besides the two lead actors Mikkola and Kokko who appear as protagonists in every segment, many well-known Finnish veteran actors make appearances in the different eras of the film's timeline. Especially Vesa Vierikko is both funny and cool as the mad scientist Strömberg in the present day segment and the legendary Åke Lindman boils in rage in his very last credited movie role as the intergalactic leader Galagf in the sci-fi scenes. Smaller roles have also been given to ex-wrestler Tony Halme (playing a bulky commander), \"the man without a past\" Markku Peltola (a scientist) and Santeri Kinnunen (an Army lieutenant). A lot of the acting is somewhat stiff and theatrical (using formal textbook language doesn't help either), but it doesn't really bother me much since the movie is largely an homage to genres that are not known for world-class acting in the first place. Even though none of the individual segments can be called a masterpiece, together they make a very entertaining whole. For a Finnish student film The Book of Fate is an extraordinary achievement, but even when compared to real genre flicks from which Molin and Lepola have drawn their inspiration, the movie is not terrible at all in spite of the appallingly low IMDb rating (3.7/10 with 436 votes at the time of writing this). There is also a lot of humour thrown in; luckily it is not the boring We-Know-We-Are-Making-a-Bad-Movie kind of intentional crappiness, but instead subtler references to the clichés of each genre (stay tuned for the hilarious post-credit faux-trailer). Fully acknowledging its diverse cinematic roots, The Book of Fate is a movie for film buffs by fellow film buffs; warmly recommended to any cinephile with an eclectic taste in popular cinema.",
         "There are different episodes with one central character, or his reincarnations.. the guy is supposed to save the world with the book of fate. Now, as the previous commentator noted, the movie is pretty much awful. It could have been put together a whole lot nicer, as the effects and some of the scenes and makeup is nicely done. What I personally see as the biggest tragedy in all of this is that Finland has never produced anything quite like The Book of Fate, and maybe the guys tried too much to fit everything there and in the end all future financing for similar movies will be withdrawn. Which is a pity. With more proficiency, it could have been shown all around the world. Veteran actors and the guy playing the reincarnation man as well as his eternal girlfriend do their job adequately, but the bottom line is, seems like the overall story just remains obscure and doesn't engage the viewer enough. Plus you can't dazzle the audience by offering them inferior copies of Matrix, Dracula or Unforgiven all spliced together.. simply doesn't work.",
         "Book Of Fate doesn't compete in the Major League, but it is nevertheless a Champion in it's own right. You'll have to put yourself in the right context: this is not a Hollywood production, not even a b-class movie with still decent budget. This is a very low-budget movie - we are talking about probably some few thousand dollars at most, no more. In fact the movie is a thesis for the two directors. Still they managed to get some of the finest Finnish professional actors in, and even the soundtrack is filled with internationally famous Finnish rock and heavy metal bands (like Nightwish with over 1.5 million records sold). These acts alone are noteworthy. The main idea of the movie are the struggles of an \"eternal champion\", and the idea is not very far from the themes of author Michael Moorcock. Also, it takes courage to select five totally different genres (horror, western, war, action thriller and SF) and combine them in an episode movie. This movie seems to divide opinions very much - and that's understandable. If you are a kind of person who is interested only in the technical details and finesse over the contents, you will be disappointed. But if you are able to see behind the financial and technical limits, you may appreciate the over-the-top pastiches of these genres, and the enthusiasm behind. Sure, the CGI-effects may be a little cranky - but so were the CGI-images of the excellent series Babylon 5. In my opinion, the only true limitations are in the people's imagination, not in the technical limitations. As far as I'm concerned, the results were highly satisfactory - I had no expectations of this movie, but I found myself entertained. And that's what this movie is all about.",
         "If you're a masokist, do watch the movie. Other than that I would never suggest to anyone that they should watch this movie. Bad acting, even worse story line. I was amazed how mad it really was.",
         "Totally crap, amateur actors and terrible storyline - i was really disappointed. If you don't have better things to do than watch this film, i feel sorry for you =)"

Far away from here there was a mythical world -free of suffering and injustice. But it wasn't enough. People wanted to play God... They created a pen to control the Booke of Fate. Mightier than a sword, it could write off deeds -and bring back the dead. But the book gave power, power caused fear -and fear brought suffering. And the suffering caused wars. Darkness fell on earth, making demands on the pen and the book. But the book was gone. It was thought to be lost forever -but hundreds of years later it reappeared on a small planet called Earth. The prophecy says: Only the chosen will get a second chance from the book. The destiny of the chosen one is to guide the book back. But his journey will be long, filled with errors and grief. This is his story.",
         "The Booke of Fate (Kohtalon kirja) is an episodic fantasy film that is divided into five stories taking place in five different centuries.

However, events take a shocking turn, and as the situation is looking hopeless, the hand of fate suddenly steps in. The priest finds a book, the Booke of Fate, which gives another chance to his soul. This is the starting point to an adventure through centuries, filled with action and surprising twists. One woman has a crucial influence on the fate of our hero in all of the stories. The hero is trying to do the right thing, but it is not easy. Every time that he fails - the stakes go up! Can the priest's soul fulfill its destiny?"
