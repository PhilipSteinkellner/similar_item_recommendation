         "The always-welcome Patton Oswalt takes the stage to discuss adulthood, fatherhood, his career, his inherent geekiness and a variety of other, entertaining topics in this charming and hilarious stand-up special. In fact it was so good I ended up watching all of the older Oswalt specials I could get my hands on, and found all of them as strong and consistent as this one. So if you're a fan of Oswalt this will be as good as you want it to be, and if you're not, it's as good a place as any to discover his style of humour. If you're up for it I recommend his special \"Finest Hour,\" which appeared before this one and addresses some topics that are further discussed and enhanced here.",
         "Recorded in Spreckels Theater in San Diego, California, comedian Patton Oswalt returns for his 5th feature-length stand-up comedy special. Did I enjoy this? Yes, I did. But the reason is because Oswalt has become such an icon that he can more or less stand in front of a camera and just exist for an hour and be worth watching. He is the kind of guy who can tell a good story. Unfortunately, this only works if you already know him. If you do not, you will walk away from this and realize he never once told any jokes... he told a few stories about Las Vegas, but no jokes. He threw out some geek and nerd references, but no jokes. Where are the quotables from yesteryear like the \"bowl of sadness\"? Are those days gone?"
