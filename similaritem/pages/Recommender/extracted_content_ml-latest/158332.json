      "reviews": ["\"Attack on the Pin-Up Boys\" is a movie with close to zero plot, below average performances and not very intelligent humor. Nonetheless, the movie is saved from being a total failure by its easy charm. The story is thin as they come: the pretty boys of the high schools of the city are being attacked by a mysterious person, who is throwing bags of smelly things to them. Curiously, the attacks only make a celebrity of them, and the 3 pretty boys of the next school in the list will try to be the one to be attacked. The story is not much to write about, but it could have been a smart and/or funny commentary on idol culture, and poke fun at all that goes around it. But the movie falls flat, the jokes range from lame to childish, and the actors (which are part of a popular Korean group) struggle to do much with what they have to work with. Nonetheless they have an easy charm and make for fun company, which gives some much needed life to the proceedings. All in all, the movie is basically emptiness, and has not much to recommend it for."],

Rumors say that the next victims will be at Neulparan High School. The studious student Kibum decides to investigate the matter, blogging all of the terror events on the 14th of each month, causing the event to become a hot topic within the student body. After several attacks, Kibum predicts that the next victim will be either Siwon, president of the student body; Heechul, president of the dance club; or Kangin, the captain of the Judo Team."],
