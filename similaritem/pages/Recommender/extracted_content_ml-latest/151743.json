         "Well, my opinion is exactly the title. I mean, I wanted to learn more about Toni, her life and her career. This movie gave me not a new thing at all for Toni. It was like someone took the article from Wikipedia and wrote a script. It is supposed to be a biography but the whole feeling is that it was total fictional. The only thing I learned is that Tamar was a drama queen since childhood. I guess that if I want to learn more for Toni I have to watch The Braxton Family Values. But to be honest Lex Scott Davis and Debbi Morgan were very good in their roles.",
         "I was never really a big Toni Braxton fan so perhaps I am not the target-group with this movie. I was really only interested because VONDIE CURTIS HALL directed it (who directed one of my favourite movies the Tupac Shakur and Tim Roth starring GRIDLOCK'd and also the pretty cool action flick WAIST DEEP with Tyrese and Larenz Tate). But had I not known that it was him who directed it and I missed his name in the start-credits I would not have thought much of the director. LIFETIME movies like these though all have very strict rules on how the script is mapped out and the performances are always played in a non-threatening PC and PG manner and the cinematography seem to be more or less the same from movie to movie, so there was probably very little V.C. HALL could (and was allowed) to do to make this stand out. Good thing is at least that they have the rights to all of Toni Braxton's music, acting is acceptable for a LIFETIME movie but a negative thing is that the lip-syncing is really poor. The script in the way it has been written doesn't have a whole lot to offer either, as usual per LIFETIME it cops out from any controversy. So yeah unless you are a big fan of TONI BRAXTON I don't think you'll get much from this."
