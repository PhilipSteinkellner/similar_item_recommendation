      "synopsis": "(some of the following content first appeared on realmoviereview.com) Fenton Meiks (Matthew McConaughey) walks into an FBI office late one evening and announces that he has information about a serial killer known as the God's Hands Killer that he will only give to the lead investigator. When Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) arrives, Meiks says the killer is his brother, Adam, who has just died. Fenton is cool and distant, and Doyle is obviously skeptical. Fenton admits to stealing his brother's body and an ambulance, to fulfill a promise to bury him in the \"rose garden\", and Doyle confirms this story by calling a small town sheriff's office. Fenton does not answer Doyle's direct questions about why Fenton knows Adam is the killer. Instead, he begins a long, involved tale about his family history. The small family of auto mechanic Dad ( Bill Paxton) and two boys has survived the loss of their mother. Twelve year old Fenton (played by Matt OLeary) is cooking meals and supervising his younger brother, Adam (played by Jeremy Sumpter). In the middle of one night, their father wakes them to say he's received a message from God. An Angel appeared to him, saying that they (Dad and the boys) have been selected to be God's Hands and cleanse demons from the world. He's been told to wait, and God will provide weapons and more information. Adam is excited about being a crime-fighting superhero, but Fenton is alarmed, asking if Dad just dreamt it or imagined it. Dad is sure it was real, but admits he doesn't know how it will all work, and admonishes the boys to keep it secret. He says if they tell, \"someone will die.\" Fenton's hopes that the idea will go away are dashed by subsequent events. Dad is drawn to ordinary-looking items by a beam of light from above, and proudly bears them home as weapons provided by the Angel: an axe, some gloves, a length of pipe. One night Dad comes home excited, showing a list of names the angel gave him in another vision. Fenton still can't believe this is happening. Dad states that these are not people, they are demons, and destroying them is God's will. Fenton hears a sound another night, and looking outside sees Dad carrying a wrapped body over his shoulder. Dad summons both boys to the shed out back, where he drops the woman, alive. She has tape over her mouth, and her hands and feet are tightly bound. Dad removes the gloves, as he's realised that touching a demon with his bare hands will reveal its true nature. He fearfully reaches towards her. When Dad's hand contacts her arm, his body stiffens and he seems electrified, shaking rapidly with an horrified expression. Dad, sure now that she is a demon, takes the axe and swings it high in the air toward her, and there's the sound of it striking home. Dad digs a grave in the rose garden behind the house. Fenton is crying that Dad has killed someone, while Dad is only sad that Fenton could not see her demon nature. Adam insists that he was able to see it, but Fenton says Adam is just lying. At times during this tale, Agent Doyle has pressed the adult Fenton for answers, which he does not always give. Fenton offers to prove it, to show him the rose garden where the bodies are buried. Doyle has him put on cuffs and get in the secured back seat of a car, and begins driving to the site. Fenton continues to tell the tale in response to Doyle's questions. Dad acquires a van and they seek out their next target, an older man who is walking into a grocery store. Dad explains that even in broad daylight, God will protect them from being seen. Dad forces Fenton to take part in the ruse to capture the man: pretending to call a dog out from under the man's car. As Dad knocks the man out, Fenton runs away crying, but cannot sum up the courage to tell the police and turn Dad in for murder. Dad assigns Fenton to dig a massive pit in the backyard, and charges him to pray, to accept God's will for their family's work. Fenton angrily digs for days, refusing gloves for his bleeding hands, and does not find spiritual comfort. They board the sides of the pit and add a roof, then slide the shed on top of it, creating a small cellar ... aware of its purpose, Fenton calls it a dungeon. When the next victim is brought, Fenton refuses to use the axe and flees, running to tell the sheriff what is happening. The sheriff pretends to agree to check, then brings Fenton home to Dad. The sheriff and Dad scoff at the story, but Fenton insists despite Dad's warning glances. Fenton brings the sheriff to the dungeon ... and Dad kills him. Then Dad vomits and cries that Fenton has made him a murderer, because he wasn't supposed to tell. Fenton says Dad is already a murderer, but Dad insists his other victims weren't people and had to be destroyed. As punishment, Dad locks Fenton in the cellar until he is in contact with God. After the first week, Fenton tells Dad there is no God. As his confinement continues, he begins to hallucinate. When he becomes unresponsive, they bring him out, and Fenton smiles and tells his father that he has seen God and understands his purpose now. Fenton is serene and confident as they go to the home of their next victim, a nasty man who is abusive towards his wife. They knock him out and bring him home. Dad performs the bare-handed touch ritual, and nods to Fenton to destroy this demon using the axe. Fenton raises it in the air .... and swings the axe sideways into Dad. Dad falls backwards across the room, the axe blade in his chest. Shocked, emotions race across his face. Adam runs to him, and Dad whispers in Adam's ear before he dies. Fenton turns to the prisoner on the floor and rips the tape from his mouth. The man cries out in warning as Adam runs towards them and swings the axe, completing Dad's intention. Fenton and Adam are burying their father and the demon in the rose garden. Fenton asks Adam to promise that \"when you destroy me, you'll bury me here\". Adam vows to do so. Agent Doyle expresses confusion - why did Adam promise Fenton to bury him there, when it is Fenton that has confessed to keeping a promise by burying Adam in the rose garden? The man known to us as Fenton Meiks reveals that he has concealed his identity, that he is actually Adam, and has buried his brother Fenton that night. Doyle suddenly realises he has put himself in danger, alone in a garden of graves with a killer. They struggle - and Doyle is knocked to the ground, wounded. As Adam touches him, horrible visions flash past - Agent Doyle killing his own mother with blood spattering everywhere, Dad's first female victim lying in bed with a man whose throat is cut, the older man luring a little girl with candy, then pulling her lifeless body from his car ... The last vision is of the real Fenton's death, at his brother Adam's hands. There is no struggle, they both have accepted the inevitable. Back in the present, Adam swings the family axe, then digs a new grave. At the FBI building the next day, those seeking the missing Agent Doyle are surprised to find that all of the security camera footage of \"Fenton\" is scrambled and distorted, so that his face cannot be seen. They travel to the real Fenton Meiks' house, and find his body, along with a list of his victims. The last name on the list is Wesley Doyle. One agent is sent to the small town sheriff's office that received Doyle's call at the beginning of the Meiks' interview. The secretary summons the sheriff - a neatly uniformed Adam Meiks. As he leaves, he tells Adam they wanted him to know about his brother before word got out to the press. Adam shakes his hand firmly, then holds on a bit longer, to the agent's confusion. Adam nods and says, \"You're a good man.\" The secretary walks out and stands behind Adam, saying, \"Praise God.\"",

         "I had to see this gem twice to really appreciate all of it. When a widowed father of two interrupts his two sons' sleep with a shocking revelation, they are torn between believing him and not. As the horrifying events of this tale unfold, we learn a lot about the father, about his two sons, and about their destinies. With shocking twist after shocking twist, this film never allows for a lull in the plot. Bill Paxton plays the father, but the most notable performances are that of his older son, Fenton, played by Matthew O'Leary and his younger son, Adam, played by Jeremy Sumpter. This is one of the best thrillers that I have seen in a while, and you will want to watch this a few times to appreciate every intricate aspect of the plot. I give this film a 9/10.",
         "This is a very dark and intriguing horror type thriller based on the idea of religious murders. The storyline centres on a deranged man who lives in Texas, US who suddenly goes on a killing spree with his two young sons after being instructed by God to redeem the world of bad people. Bill Paxton who directs this movie plays the deranged Father who is known as the Hand of God Killer while Matthew McConaughey plays his finest performances to date as the oldest son, Fenton Meiks. The film revolves around Fenton who decides he can no longer hold the burden of his murderous childhood alone and uses flashbacks to hauntingly tell the story to FBI Agent Wesley Doyle (played by Powers Boothe). I cannot think of many movies that literally keep the viewer chained to their seat from start to finish and this is definitely one of them. Even if you want to stop watching, you wont be able to because of the sheer power of this movie. The directors have filmed this movie very well, and they help to set the plot through the good scenery. The acting in this movie is great but if there is any drawback it is that some parts are very powerful and may disturb some people. Whilst the concept of this film is very dark, the young children help to portray the idea through brilliant acting. This really is a spine tingly movie and it is guaranteed to have you at the edge of your seat throughout. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys horror, disturbing and powerful movies or anyone who just wants to see something different. 8/10",
         "There is such rubbish on the cable movie channels that I hit a gem with this one. From beginning to end it had me gripped and deserves top marks. Father of two sons hears messages from \"God\" to kill people who he is told are 'demons'. When the opening credits showed the director as one of the cast that can often be a warning of a bad film; exceptionally it is the reverse here as the drama is non-stop from beginning to end. And there is not one moment in the movie when one is not fully enthralled as there are no unnecessary or needless sub-plots, and the script is first class. All the actors give wholly convincing performances especially the lead child actor who is exceptional. This film is at least as good as the likes of 'Silence of the Lambs'.",
         "Bill Paxton stars in and directs this highly original film. Having watched the first time I was by how good it was. The reviews I had heard were OK . As a result I was expecting an average thriller at most .However because of Paxtons excellent directing and acting the film is well worth watching , especially if you are a horror film fanatic.The film is also helped by the plot twists which keep coming until the closing credits . The films strongest point is the storyline which I have to say is highly original and is like I have ever seen before. Well done also to the 2 young leads which perfectly convey the emotions if these confused boys. I give this film 9/10 and I highly recommend that everyone catches it.",
         "The film is very complete in what it is, keeping one continuously interested with the flashbacks to childhood and growing up with such a bizarre father, and interspersing it with the tails of serial murder, one simply cannot go wrong. The very plot in itself, the very story and essence of the film, is entertaining. It is the sort of story that the director (Bill Paxton) could do so much with, and in this case, he really did do a lot with it. From beginning to end you are kept anticipating more and more about what is happening and where the film is going, and the creativity that is behind this story is first class. I felt as if this film was exquisitely done from start to finish, and one of those rare gems that seemed to be without any boring lulls -- the action flowing neatly, quickly, and tightly from one scene to the next. It demonstrates just how far people can go: so as to do such horrible things to their loved ones, and to do such acts of evil, in the name of 'God' when they are disillusioned as in this case. It also is sometimes interesting in its' twists & takes on the concept of morality as a whole. Overall, this is the sort of film that one easily overlooks, but I would recommend you to not do likewise and to check this film out -- it is very much so worth your time.",
         "The synopsis for this movie does a great job at explaining what to expect. It's a very good thriller. Well shot. Tough to believe it was Bill Paxton's directorial debut, though some shots do look EXACTLY like a storyboard version. Still, there are a few shots that really look good and show some real imagination on the part of Paxton. It's a solid story with some great twists at the end, several of them, all believable, all fun, and best of all, obscured well enough to make them true twists. The child actors in the movie do a great, too. I'm usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as Nickelodeon rejects, but both these kids do a good job. This movie is not gory. It's not very scary. But it IS very, very creepy.",
         "I first saw the trailer for Frailty on Yahoo Movies way back in the day, after hearing Stephen King praise it to high heaven. Not really a fan of either star, I still wanted to see it because I'm a huge thriller fan. I was not disappointed. The acting was superb, especially from the two young boys. Usually I loathe child actors, but Young Adam and Young Fenton were excellent. Bill Paxton really did a good job of directing it too. It was beautifully shot. One must also note the plot twists. The three twists at the end hit hard and fast, and I didn't see them coming. The final twist of the film, coupled with the gravity of what had just been revealed, gives me chills to this day, even though I've re-watched the film so many times. A true gem.",
         "This entire review is a SPOILER! This is only for those who've seen Frailty! You've been warned! I either see Frailty as a genius movie, or a badly botched effort. I know what Hanley, the screenwriter, wanted. If the movie had been made according to his wishes, I would agree with the commentaries on the DVD and agree with the general premise as seen on the surface of the movie. However, as it stands, I do not see it that way at all. And there are subtle and not so subtle clues that Frailty was meant to be something altogether even more subversive than what is seen. Other reviewers have spotted the anomalies, while others have gotten upset at the thought that Adam and Dad Meiks really were getting orders from God. I admit it... as a Christian, the thought does upset me, but not nearly enough to attack the producers and actors in writing or otherwise. And, I must admit, that Dad and Adam were receiving orders from a god... but which one? The God of the Bible? Or the God of the Earth? Either one could perform miracles... such as hiding Daddy Meiks' kidnappings, fuzzing up the video monitor, lousing up anyone's memory- and leading Daddy and Adam Meiks to think they are seeing demonic acts in the minds of innocent people. The first three quarters of the movie works perfectly, with nothing out of place, except Dad's supposed visions. We at first see Dad Meiks as a madman, a ruthless killer, and maniacal child abuser. When I first watched, I had the gut feeling that this was no tale of human insanity, but this was the Real McCoy- a supernatural thriller with vastly disturbing psychological undertones... and I was right. The clues given in the FBI building let any viewer know that some other power besides human capabilities is at work here. The fuzzing up of Adam's face in the video monitor might have been coincidence, but it's reinforced by the fact that a trained observer also could not remember Adam's face.... plus, there are Adam's visions, revealed in a chilling line up of scenes from the times Daddy Meiks laid his bare hands on the captured 'demons'. Taken at face value, we are clearly shown that Adam has taken over Dad Meiks' holy mission, and is pursuing it with a flair Daddy Meiks never displayed. We see, on the surface, that Fenton Meiks was a demon, planted by dark powers to bring an end to Dad's righteous mission. And yes, Hanley did want Fenton to be the demon right from the beginning, well before Frailty was made. Colombine reared its tragic head above the horizon of public awareness while Frailty was in production, thus forcing some changes in the way the plot was presented. Adam was shown to be following God's orders, and he was a righteous human being, doing everything any good American should do: fighting evil with all of his cunning and might- and winning! The panning shot, as the camera pulled away from Adam and his lovely wife pounded that fact home, thus arousing the ire of many a Christian across this great land of ours.... But Bill Paxton's commentary opens up a whole new boiling kettle of worms, as does Brian Tyler's great score for the movie. I do think Bill Paxton has put together a different movie than the one that appears on the surface... and he gives clues in his commentary, and there's a great big clue in the story itself. I will get to it soon... First, how many people did a double-take when Fenton asked Adam to bury him in the rose garden when Adam destroyed him? How many viewers felt as though the plot of a different movie had been pasted on? Matt O'Leary seemed to me to be as disbelieving in that twist as I was... way out of character for the character he had portrayed so excellently all through the movie. Did the kid forget how to act in just that one scene? Did Paxton forget how to direct? Was Fenton really the demon? Please remember that Fenton was the only character in the entire movie to display feelings of kindness and the actions of a thinking, rational, caring human being. Let's go over them, to the best of my memory.... Daddy Meiks, whatever his previous actions towards his kids might have been, became a cold-blooded killing machine. While protesting love for Fenton, he tortured his elder son without remorse or the slightest hint of mercy. Adam as an adult is cold and calculating, the very picture of smug self-righteousness and hatred woven into a finely honed killing machine. Adam, the child, as acted so superbly by Jeremy Sumpter, had all the human feelings of a radish as he bought Daddy Meiks' story without hesitation. Little Adam was ready to kill right from the start, even willing to slaughter his fellow students, with a made up list. Daddy Meiks showed his sanity by stopping little Adam in his tracks... or did he? Adam had the psychological makeup, right from the start, of a fanatic. Was Daddy's mild rebuke going to stop him? I have my doubts... The old sheriff was shown to be a very disagreeable man, at least from Fenton's point of view. Let's see.... Powers Booth's character, Agent Doyle. He was just as surly as the old sheriff. Maybe he really was a demon, maybe he was just sick of the killings he had to investigate. Whatever the reason, Doyle was not a pleasant man. We only get to see his mother in the photo on Doyle's desk and in the vision of her getting killed by her own son, the very Agent Doyle in charge of investigating the God's Hand murders. The other agent, whose name escapes me, is a butt-kissing toady, showing not an ounce of brains whenever he is on screen. The 'demons' Daddy Meiks captures... whether or not they are truly demons, they are hardly shown in their best light. Who does that leave, in Frailty, who might show humane feelings? Sheriff Adam Meiks' pretty wife, in his office? To tell you the truth, she creeped me out. As pretty as she was, she made me glad I was not in the same state as she was. Happy never to have met her... So.... we are left with Fenton to see humanity of thought and action.... and he is the demon. Nice little message for those who see this movie. I saw that particular twist coming, but wished it wouldn't. It was the easy way out and Frailty, up until that point, was too well done to deserve being trashed by that garbage pail of a twist. Or was it? We are shown that Doyle was a demon, who mercilessly slaughtered his beloved mother. He even asks Adam how he knew. Case closed, right? Wrong. The 'vision' Adam has shows a young Doyle knifing his mother to death. The photo on Doyle's desk, which the camera pans so lovingly, shows a much older Agent Doyle posing in the photograph. Huh? Was that a production mistake? Could be... but it was shown for so long. It would have been easy to show a young Doyle in that photo, but they did not do so. Was that a clue as to the truth? As another reviewer points out, Adam could be delusional. I have this question: How could an older Doyle be posing with his mom if he was much younger when he killed her? If Fenton was a true demon, why did he not kill his Dad before his Dad killed him? Daddy was trusting enough to sleep with Fenton in the house, Otis was available, or a sharp knife. Fenton was shown to be physically resilient and, despite the power which protected Dad, Fenton was able to kill the man quite handily... Demons were declared to be completely merciless, but Fenton did not kill Adam in his sleep, nor with the axe, as he could have done. He need not have left the axe in Dad's chest, please remember. Dad killed the old sheriff. Why? Because the angel had said someone would have to die if someone snitched about Dad's holy mission... But who would seek that vengeance? God claims the right of vengeance. Daddy Meiks took it upon himself to wreak vengeance for Fenton revealing the plan. I doubt if God would take kindly to that. It looked far away, but the entrance to the cellar was very close by when Fenton and the old sheriff had their little conversation... which revealed the old man was exasperated beyond endurance with Fenton's 'lies'. Daddy Meiks had to have heard them. He knew God covered his tracks under worse circumstances than this (Kidnapping an old man in broad daylight in a crowded parking lot comes to mind for starters.), but he slaughtered the sheriff anyway. Supposedly, the old man was a friend of his. Is this the actions of a man doing God's work? Like many so-called Christians, Daddy is quite willing to blame Fenton for murdering the sheriff. The DEVIL made me do it!\" In other words, Daddy Meiks would not take the blame for his own sins. There's a little more to think about. Daddy Meiks was told Fenton was a demon... and Dad touches Fenton's bare skin with his bare hands for what seems like a long time. Daddy proclaims his love for his son; saying he loves Fenton and values him more than his own life. He then proceeds to torture Fenton to within an inch of the child's life, in order to prove to the angel Fenton is NOT a demon. Finally, Fenton admits to being wrong and Dad receives him back into the family with full honors... if Fenton will kill the next demon Daddy captures. Since Hanley himself claims demons are remorseless killers, and very cunning, why would Fenton put himself through this? Seems to me he would have agreed from the get-go and slaughtered Daddy, as he did, when Dad's guard was down. Why put himself through such an ordeal? Maybe Fenton really was the truly moral one? Adam gave Fenton water during the torture... on Daddy's orders. I strongly feel that Adam would have given Fenton nothing if his father said not to. Adam saves Fenton from Daddy's axe, after the old sheriff is murdered. Was this not noble? Think about it... Why kill the fall-guy? Paxton's commentary, at the end of Frailty, was very interesting... We are shown Adam's wife, and she is pregnant. Paxton says, \"See? There's another demon...\" and waits what seems to me to be a rather long time to correct himself, saying demon hunter instead. Huh? And that long panning shot.... as the camera pulls away. Why, if Adam and his wife are working for God, does the DEMONIC opening music start in? It does not start after the credits begin rolling, but well before it. And Paxton insisted that the opening themes be used. It is NOT godly music, by any stretch of the imagination. Talk about subversive... Is Adam really a demon? Is he following Satan's orders, thinking that the devil is GOD? Paxton says he sees the movie as Dad's tragedy... he was killed because of Fenton's cunning. With this in mind, the movie plays really differently on a second viewing. However, what if I am right? That Daddy Meiks was sincere cannot be doubted: he really did think he was working for God, and he truly loved Fenton, as misguided as his actions were. And Fenton really was the kindly, humane older brother... this would make it a double tragedy... Dad's and Fenton's. What about Adam? His is the heart and mind and soul of the born psychopath. Watch him as an adult... watch him as a child. Yes, Daddy Meiks, there really was a demon in your family. Guess who! And wouldn't the right-wing Christian community have LOVED such a message? My rating? If Fenton was the demon- 5 out of 10... If Adam was... 9 out of 10. Take your pick!",
         "A very promising directorial debut for Bill Paxton. A very dark thriller/who-really-done-it recommended by Stephen King. This is a strong, well-conceived horror tale about a devout, but demented man in Thurman, Texas that goes on a murdering spree after getting orders from God to eliminate demons trying to control mankind. A couple of plot twists and an eerie finale makes for your moneys worth. Most of the violence you don't really see, but still enough to double up your stomach. Director Paxton plays the twisted man to be known as the Hand of God Killer. Matthew McConaughey is equally impressive as the demented man's eldest son that ends up telling this story to a Dallas FBI Agent(Powers Boothe). Boothe, as always, is solid and flawless. Suspenseful white knuckler! Highly recommended.",
         "This movie made me really quite angry. Technically, it's well done and it has some scenes that will have you at the edge of your seats. But who the hell financed its making? The \"United States Christian Serial Killer Association\"?? The movie seems to be saying that guys who kill a lot of people, claiming that God told them to do it- are probably right! They know things you and I don't. Hello?? What kind of message is THAT? That the brother showing up at the office of the Powers Boothe character turns out to be the younger brother who naively went along with the lunacy of his father from the beginning was a nice plot twist, but what follows as soon as they reach the notorious rose garden is an insult to the audience. Even if you're a Christian -which I am not- there can't be any justification for the message this movie's ending is sending, what with \"Thou shalt not kill\" and all...these self-styled demon-killers would roast in hell."
