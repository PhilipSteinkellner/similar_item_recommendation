         "content": "Sexy is unique.\r\n\r\nDread is a deliciously spiteful British horror adapted from a Clive Barker short story. Plot has three college students meeting up and working together on a documentary about the nature of people\u2019s fears. As things progress it becomes apparent that one of them has an ulterior motive.\r\n\r\nDirector and screenplay writer Anthony DiBlasi spends a considerable portion of the film establishing the psychological make-ups of the principal players, which is a key component to making the film work. Theo Green\u2019s music trundles away menacingly during this portion of pic, while Sam McCurdy\u2019s photography is on the money, with unnerving shades of green, reds and blues stripped back for a perfect troubled world feel.\r\n\r\nOnce the worm turns, and motives and mental anguishes show themselves, Dread reveals a cruel hand of such psychological force that the impact is troubling. Yet this is no torture porn picture, the gore is minimum and this for sure is not a slasher type of film either. It\u2019s a slice of mental cruelty mixed with a damaged seed, two bad aspects of human nature crashing together to assault those interested in the psychologically based splinter of horror.\r\n\r\nOh and the ending is a cracker-jack, guaranteed to jolt you, for better or worse! 7.5/10",

      "synopsis": "At a small unnamed English college, Quaid and his friend Stephen (a film student), do a Fear Study as a school project, recording people talking about their greatest fears and worst times in their lives. Quaid however is quite insane and wants to take the fear to \"the next level\". Quaid saw his parents murdered by an axe murderer as a child, this is his greatest fear and he wants to learn what makes others afraid and what it takes for them to overcome their fear. Stephen lost his brother as a teen, his brother was driving drunk and he wonders if he had driven if his brother would still be dead, Quaid buys the same model car and wants Stephen to drive it, and Stephen does. Joshua is a student who gets interviewed by Quaid where he reveals that his fear is becoming deaf again for he lost his hearing for a while after a childhood accident. The following night, shows up at Quaid's house because Quaid told him he had more questions for him. Quaid knocks him out, chains him to a radiator, fires a gun next to his ears, shattering his eardrums and leaving him deaf again. Quaid then drops Joshua off in an alley and goes home again. Abby, a girl involved with the project, has a dark birth mark covering half of her face and also her body, which she doesn't want anyone to see and is terrified of being teased or shunned because of her birthmark. Quaid has video footage of her stripping naked before sex and he sets it up so every TV on campus is showing her naked, and covered in birth marks, he holds up signs in the video which read, \"You will never be normal\". Humiliated she goes home, fills a bathtub with bleach and starts scrubbing off her skin with a Brillo pad. Stephen shows up at her dorm as she stumbled down the hall naked and bleeding. He gets her to the hospital and goes after Quaid, grabbing the fire axe off the wall to take with him. While he is leaving the hospital, Joshua, who is now clearly deaf follows after him, remembering that Stephen was with Quaid during his interview and assumes they are working together. Cheryl, who is editing the project and who Stephen is in love with, was molested by her father as a girl, he worked at a meat packing plant and he smelled of meat while molesting her so to this day she can't stand the smell of meat and refuses to eat it. Quaid kidnaps her and locks her in a room with a huge piece of beef. After about a week, she finally eats the entire piece of rotten beef. When Stephen shows up and confronts Quaid, Quaid knocks him out, when he awakens he is tied to a chair and Quaid is showing him video footage of him torturing Cheryl. Quaid claims that he let Cheryl go after she ate the meat. Stephen thinks he's lying. Quaid hears a noise downstairs, and goes to check it out. Stephen breaks free. Stephen and Joshua run into each other as Quaid hides and watches. Joshua stabs Stephen with the axe on the floor. Quaid appears and shoots Joshua in the back of the head killing him. Quaid stands over Stephen's body watching him bleed out from the axe wound. Once Stephen is dead, he drags the body down stairs, unlocks a door in the basement, inside is Cheryl, he throws Stephens body in with her, throws a tiny knife on the floor and says, \"Let's see how hungry you have to be to get through that\". He slams the door shut and leaves her crying with Stephen's dead body.",

         "A chance meeting between smart, sensitive Stephen Grace (Jackson Rathbone) and charming, mysterious Quaid (Shaun Evans) results in a college project to study the intimate fears which people have. With the help of fellow student Abby (Hanne Steen), the advert is placed and the camera begins to roll on a series of interviews as the trio start to document their findings. However, each of the three has their own fears to deal with, not least of all Quaid whose childhood is stained by a terrible trauma... Having never read the original short story by Clive Barker (\"Hellraiser\", \"Lord Of Illusions\") that \"Dread\" is based upon, i wasn't certain what to expect from this movie. Last year we were given the impressive (and criminally overlooked) \"Midnight Meat Train\" also based upon a Clive Barker story, and \"Dread\" continues the trend of incredible horror movies adapted from his work. \"Dread\" takes its time setting up its premise but i hesitate to call it slow-moving. Every scene is important to the story, and the chemistry between the three leads ensures that you keep watching. There is a real tension in \"Dread\" as Quaid's behaviour becomes more erratic whilst his obsession with the project starts to grow to dangerous levels. By the point at which the taped confessions are no longer enough for him, the audience has spent enough time with the characters to feel uncomfortable at what might occur next. It's rare to find a horror movie where you feel genuinely sorry for the victims. It's also good to see a movie about students which appears to be set in the real world rather than a stylised Hollywood version of it; these are multi-dimensional young adults rather than catalogue models reciting hip dialogue to one another. The cast is excellent without a bad performance to be found. Evans impresses as a character who is capable of moving from charming to dangerous without blinking, but the stand-out would have to be Laura Donelly who plays a girl with a gigantic birthmark covering one side of her body. Although initially brimming with confidence, her heartbreaking vulnerability gradually rises to the surface and you can't help but emphasise with her. Jonathon Readwin is also fantastic in a smaller role as one of the trio's interviewees. Don't be fooled into thinking that \"Dread\" will be your average teen-stalker horror movie. Sure, there is blood and death but this a more cerebral effort than usual; a bone-chilling descent into madness and obsession with a careful and deliberate pace. There are no sudden scares to be found here; only a creeping sense of foreboding and a third act that will stay with you long after the credits have finished rolling. Make no mistake; the final scenes in this movie are ruthless and nasty, but they are also very well-written. \"Dread\" is a solid effort. If you are a serious horror fan, this is certainly worth your time.",
         "Having watched around 600 horror and thriller movies over the course of the last 20 years. I have rarely come across a horror flick that has the intellectual prowess of \"Dread\". This is a very well done adaptation of Barkers short story, and has kept the dark and ominous feel of the original. The cinematography is masterfully done while keeping an almost home movie feel. The flickering lights and dark sets lend an eerily dreamlike feel to the bulk of the movie so that when the brighter scenes appear the contrast is quite stark.To say this movie is disturbing would be an understatement. The decent into madness depicted here is powerfully dramatic and quite intense. Not only is there violence, gore, and blood, but a realistic view of trauma inflicted psychosis becoming complete madness. The bottom line is this. The ability to suspend disbelief is the cornerstone of any good story and this one delivers in buckets.",
         "Based on the Clive Barker short story, Dread, which made its world premiere at the 2009 edition of Montreal's Fantasia film festival, is remarkable on two fronts: Barker's striking departure from his traditional macabre story lines, and Anthony DiBlasi's impressive directorial debut. The story unfolds with two college students, Steve (Twilight's Jackson Rathbone) and Quaid (Shaun Evans), agreeing to work together to create a documentary of people's innermost fears. The two put out a call for candidates and document their interviews on video. An expert manipulator, Quaid is able to coax these troubled souls into revealing their innermost demons; deeply personal revelations they would otherwise never dream of discussing in public, much less on camera. Meanwhile Quaid harbors deep seated psychological scars of his own, having been a childhood survivor of the brutal home invasion axe slaying of his parents at the hands of a mysterious psycho. Espousing the belief that by confronting one's ultimate fear an individual will either overcome their phobia or be consumed by it, Quaid convinces the more demure Steve, and friends Cheryl and Abby to participate in the study. Unknown to everyone involved, however, is Quaid's desire to take things to the next level, progressing beyond mere interviews to the actual physical and psychological nightmare of tackling their fears head on. DiBlasi displays a remarkably talented hand at spinning a yarn that incorporates introspective, character-driven drama and some spectacularly jolting and emotionally moving sequences. While deviating out of necessity from the plot structure of Barker's original story, which didn't provide much \"meat\" for a feature length film, Barker equally deserves kudos for providing DiBlasi with a twisted tale that is firmly rooted in the real world, where human cruelty is infinitely more tangible and terrifying than anything the supernatural can invoke. Led by Rathbone and Evans, the young cast turns in uniformly strong, nuanced and intensely emotional performances not typically found in this genre. Among the standouts is Hanne Steen, who plays Cheryl, a friend infatuated with Steve who bears the curse of a disfiguring skin pigmentation that covers a third of her face and body. Steen deftly manages to convey her character's sensitivity and long held pain in a manner that the viewer can readily attune to, earmarking her as a future talent to watch. As debuts go DiBlasi's Dread is as solid, slick, engaging and thought provoking as it is terrifying, making this a must see, not merely for fans of the genre, but anyone with untold skeletons in their closet.",
         "The outcast cinema student Stephen Grace (Jackson Rathbone) does not drive cars due to the trauma of losing his brother in a car accident. When he meets the lonely Quaid (Shaun Evans), who has dreadful nightmares and daydreams with the death of his parents that were slaughtered by a unknown man with his father's ax when he was a six year-old boy, they befriend each other and Quaid proposes a research about the innermost fear that each individual has. Stephen sees the chance of developing an original thesis for the college and invites his friend Cheryl Fromm (Hanne Steen) to work with them in the interview and in the edition. Among the interviewees, Stephen talks to his colleague Abby (Laura Donnelly) that works with him in the library and has a great complex due to the large mole she has in her face and body. When the work is almost ready, Quaid has an outburst against one interviewee that is providing fake information and destroys the camera and edition equipment; however, he sends one copy to the college and Stephen succeeds in his project. Then the disturbed Quaid meets Stephen again and the student sees that his friend is actually beginning his personal fear research driving people to the edge. \"Dread\" is a gruesome horror movie surprisingly great, with an excellent development of the four lead characters � Stephen, Quaid, Cheryl and Abby. The beginning is disclosed in slow pace and the last part is horrific; I almost vomited with the scene of Cherryl and the rotten steak. My only remark in this story is the complete absence of police after the disappearance of people and discovery of the harmed teenagers. The unexpected gloomy conclusion is one of the best I have recently seen in a horror movie. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): \"Lentes do Mal\" (\"Lens of the Evil\")",
         "While I disagree with your review, I respect your opinion. However, the last line you wrote makes no sense. You wrote, \"We all know already what humans can do to fellow human beings. We don't need to watch it over and over again.\" Why watch anything then? We all know humans fall in love, so why watch Romantic Comedies? We all know cops bust criminals, so why watch Action films? And Dramas are full of the things we all do as humans, so why watch those? This film is a solid effort and one of the better Barker adaptations to date. It contains all of the elements of classic Clive; sex, revenge, desire and, of course, blood and bodily harm. Keep those Books of Blood coming!",
         "I'm a horror movie fan, and lately I've been very sick of the dredge coming out of Hollywood with very a loosely interpreted genre of \"horror\". I initially only watched this because Jackson Rathbone stars in it and I love him as an actor and have enjoyed many of his films. In this movie as well as others he brings a special depth and quirky charm to his characters. This movie starts rather slow - however the build up is definitely worth the wait in the end. The plot is entirely believable and the acting genuine. Not to mention that there were some moments in this film that I personally thought topped even the most squeamish moments in the \"Saw\" franchise. This is NOT a movie to watch if you are faint of heart or get grossed out easily. However this is a completely unique story and I've never seen anything like it before. I love Clive Barker yet I've not read the story on which this movie is based (am definitely putting it on my \"to read\" list!). As a horror movie it stands out above the crowd as one of the best in years if you've got the stomach for it!",
         "I actually have to get some Clive Barker books and read some of his stories. This is again one of the adaptations of one his stories and it's a pretty decent effort. The idea behind the story/movie is pretty great and has to do with human behavior/fear. While other movies might have exploited the \"torture\" part of that more, this movie is more subtle. Of course you could see this as a bad thing, but I quite liked the movie. Even/despite characters, that are all more or less not likable. You are not really rooting for one of the characters that much, they are all human, with flaws (some psychological, some physiological). The good thing is, that the movie does stir away from the books ending. Some saw it as something bad, but I like when the movie takes a chance (and succeeds in my opinion)!",
         "This movie was a real positive surprise. It felt both original and well done. Simply a real good movie to watch. It's perhaps hard to place this movie in any particular genre. Psychological-horror would be the best way to describe this movie. It plays on the deep rooted fears of people but please don't expect from this movie to give you plenty of scare moments, or anything of that sort. It's not really an horror in the classic most common sense of the word. The drama plays an important part as well, which only strengthens the movie its psychological-horror aspects. In that regard alone this movie already works out as an original and interesting one. But above all things, it's also a really well done film. It has a good build up and narrative, some fine actors and the movie has a good look over it as well. It's not a big budget movie that had a big cinematic release anywhere but you can't really tell that, judging by the movie its looks or just overall greatness. Actually hard to believe that this was the first ever movie for director Anthony DiBlasi, who was also rumored to direct the new Hellraiser movie for a while. He would had certainly been capable of it and he had worked with Clive Barker, the creator of the Hellraiser franchise, before, which was on this movie actually, that got based on a short story by Clive Barker. His approach of the horror and more serious story aspects, which he shows that he is capable off with this movie, would had been great for a new Hellraiser movie. The movie has a story that steadily but slowly progresses. Yet the movie becomes never a boring or dragging one because it is capable of getting you involved with the characters and their stories. It's a real intriguing movie to watch and because it's being so original, you also can't really predict all the time what is going to happen next in it. No, not everything works convincing or works out as strong and effective as it could had but still this movie feels like a breath a fresh air and is perfectly watchable. A nice, original, well done little film. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",
         "\"Dread\" is a work that will remain in your mind for some time after watching the movie. The movie will make you feel sick in your stomach, just like \"Saw\" and \"Hostel\", but what separates \"Dread\" from other movies in the same genre is the level of intellectual incorporated into this movie. Yes, I am talking about intellectual that is very sick, but again, there is no limit to humans intellectual. Cast wise, I don't know anyone. I have no idea whether they are small timers or novice at all, but all of them did a very good job. I have seen low budget independent movies starring actors who don't even know the basics of acting, just pretty faces. But \"Dread\" steers itself clear by its cast, which does a very good job. The best thing(or rather, sick thing) about this movie is that even though it lacks the blood, gore and violence of \"Saw\" or \"Hostel\" or \"Texas Chainsaw\", you still feel sick by the events in the movie. Cause, \"Dread\" showcase human's limit, when faced with the thing they most fear, in a very naturalistic way. The dark setting throughout the movie greatly adds to the overall sordid atmosphere. Overall, watch this movie. But one thing, it's not for faint hearted. Even though it's not a horror movie with creepy creatures and gore, it will disgust you for sure. My Verdict: 7/10",
         "I'm going to start off this review by saying that you should see this movie right away because it will not disappoint you and that this movie is just not given a lot of credit. Really people? A 5.6? This movie deserves at least a 7 hands down and I will tell you why. First of the acting was surprising good and since I've only ever watched Jackson Rathbone in the two Twilight, where he doesn't talk barely at all, I was really excited to see this guy as a man actor in a movie with more than 2 lines of dialogue. Let me tell you folks he did not fail to amaze me with his acting ability. I thought at the beginning I would only be seeing an alone, depressing/laughable, personality, but throughout the movie he grew into a serious role that helped carry the movie further. I do not think there is a point of summarizing this movie because that's what the internet, and of the back of the movie case, is for but basically it's a school project based on people's worst fears and the **** hits the fan in the middle of the film, which is good. It's quite original and the cinematography and editing is definitely something I admire, especially since I go to school for this stuff. All I can say is that you should see this film once you get the chance and you most will definitely appreciate it because it is most likely one of the best horror movies I have ever watched."
