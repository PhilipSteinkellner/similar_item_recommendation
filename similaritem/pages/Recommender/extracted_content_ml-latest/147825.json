         "Although partly set in Lisbon, this is essentially a Budapest movie that is finally able to show how does it feel to be a young adult in Hungary's capital. \"For some inexplicable reason\"'s real strength lies in its honestly - it doesn't feel like a bigger budget art movie, rather you feel like roaming around with your friends on the streets of your hometown. You may make some detours or find some odd details that may not add up to a thorough story on the way, but that is how real life works, isn't it? So what to expect when you meet those friends? You will laugh sometimes, you will be sad for a while, you will recall your own experiences (especially if you are twenty-something or from Central Europe)... and I guess you will recall some scenes and thoughts from the movie even days later. Surgeon general's warning: watching this movie may make you want to visit Budapest. Avoid it if your normal diet consists solely of Hollywood movie.",
         "The movie Moscow Square beautifully showed us what it felt like living in the last years of the falling socialism. For Some Inexplicable Reason can be called the millennials' Moscow Square with its goal to capture the life of unemployed university graduate Áron who studied film history. Director Gábor Reisz, in his first full-length movie, used professional actors to play the parts of the Áron's family, and amateurs for portraying his friends. The film can be called artsy for having montages and not having a typical Hollywood like structure. It feels very true with its many references to politics, migration, living in Budapest, relationships, and spirit of Hungarian people. Humour plays an important role, as well as sorrow, and this is why this movie can be so appealing to Central- Europeans. Some can argue with me, but I think choosing Áron Ferenczik to play the star role wasn't the greatest idea, but he manages to do a respectable job, this can be also said to the supporting actors. The Soundtrack, as well as many scenes are very memorable. I can recommend this movie, if you feel like not having a goal in life, and also if you live in Central Europe or you are young and like Hungarian Humour. I hope to see many great movies from Gábor Reisz!",
         "Interested in how life is in Budapest in 2015? Here you'll find a great testimony of a 29-year old and his group of friends: Budapest people that could be any of us. The main character, Aron is after university, after a break-up and before knowing what he'd really like to do with his life. While couple scenes are set in Lisbon, Portugal the movie really is about Budapest featuring popular pubs, restaurants, well-known streets and squares, the atmosphere of the Budapest night and the life and thoughts of close-to-30 and little-after-30 guys. Have your calculator ready for counting how's the salary of the guys in euro/usd or any well-known currency and have your ears ready for Hungarian language. After the movie you won't mix up Bucharest with Budapest, guaranteed!"
