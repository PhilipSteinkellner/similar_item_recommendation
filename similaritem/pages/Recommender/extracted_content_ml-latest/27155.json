         "This was the episode I had been awaiting more than any of this TV series . .. and I was NOT disappointed! The thought of the two superhero big-guns joining forces on TV was always a big dream of mine, and this does the job magnificently. Each hero is given their own distinct personality: Batman, dark and imposing; Superman, strong yet gentle. The personalities of the villains were also a great contrast. My highlight was the knockdown-drag-out fight between the Joker's girl, Harley Quinn and Mercey Graves, Lex Luthor's assistant. I was also surprised at the level of maturity that the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Lois Lane was handled. I especially liked the reactions of everyone when Batman threw Superman across the nightclub (especially Superman's)! What I didn't like was the way in which Superman discovered Batman's identity. I won't reveal it, but suffice it to say that Batman would be better prepared for what Superman does. All I've got to say is that I hope that some studio will bring this story to the big screen with the proper actors (Val Kilmer as Batman, Kevin Sorbo as Superman) and director (Tim Burton, please come home!).",
         "This video, the Batman/Superman Movie, was originally released during the Fall 1997 season of the New Batman-Superman Adventures on the Kids WB! network. It consisted of a three-part episode arc called \"World's Finest,\", and aired in a contiguous 90-minute special during WB's Saturday morning line-up. \"World's Finest\" is one the best episodes of both the Batman and the Superman Animated Series, and features what so many fans, including myself, have yearned for: a team-up between the two icons of D.C. Comics' 60+ year empire, the Man of Steel and the Dark Knight Detective. The stalwart Superman and the bold Batman find themselves forced to pool their admirable abilities in order to fend off the fiendish Joker who has acquired a generous amount of kryptonite and plans to sell it to the Man of Tomorrow's greatest enemy, the vile industrialist Lex Luthor. A fine storyline plays out in this visually stimulating episode arc, wonderfully animated in the style of Emmy-winning producers Paul Dini and Bruce W. Timm. The two heroes are much like they were at the beginning of the Post-Crisis Era of D.C. Comics circa 1986. They are wary of one another, not friendly, and distrusting. However, we see early on that they discover one another's identities, which also brings about a great deal of problems. Superman and Batman have continued to appear one another in their respective shows, including a fantastic episode \"Knight Time,\" where Superman is forced to don the uniform of the Dark Knight in order to discover who or what's behind the disappearance of Bruce Wayne. Check out these wonderful series, but don't bother to head down to Wal-Mart and buy the video. Just wait...it'll pop up on your local WB Network carrier, and if you can stand the commercials, tape away! Highly recommended.",
         "The only thing I can fault Warner Bros for with this movie is for NOT stamping the classic Superman/Batman label of \"World's Finest\" on the box. Paul Dini and Bruce Timm -- indeed, everyone who has worked on these two animated series have proven time and again their respect for these characters and their talent in their portrayal. Seeing them TOGETHER -- well, it's a comic book geek's dream come true. Sure, it falls prey to the team-up concept of using one villain from each hero's mythos, but it does it well. What's more, the casts from each TV show have always been above par and are welcome together. Kevin Conroy and Tim Daly, as Batman and Superman, are the best on-screen pairing of the two heroes EVER. If Warner Bros had any sense at all, they'd forget Joel Schumaker and Tim Burton and give the next Batman and Superman movies to the great people who make the animated series a joy to watch every week. Oh -- and one more thing -- with the sudden influx of other heroes on these guy's shows: Steel, Supergirl, the Creeper, Green Lantern, Aquaman, the Flash, Nightwing -- when are we going to get the Justice League of America cartoon show that we're clamoring for? Get with it, WB!",
         "Down and out on a Friday night, I took refuge at a friend of mines house. Before long Brittany on MTV grew dull and we popped on the Batman/Superman Animated movie. At first a little edgy, thinking haven't they dragged them both though the mud enough, where does the marketing end. But With in seconds of the opening credits, I was glued to the screen, transfixed at what I was seeing there. A very classy, if somewhat gaudy representation of the two characters I grew up with. Batman and Superman, at first not willing to work together to stop The Murderous Joker and Side Kick Harleyquin on a vendetta to kill Superman, love those plot devices, but latter using their own unique style of vigilante justice in unison to bring the evildoers in. I really should write comics. Animation wise it's a step above the usual Saturday morning cartoons of the respective heroes however its still at least a flight bellow your usual Disney feature film. I guess when you are paying the lowest bidding animation studio to slap this stuff together you cant be too picky. Produced by long time Batman writer Paul Dini. The man who is 90% responsible for bring the fantastic Batman animated series to us over the last 4 years, he really went and out did him self here. The dialogue is both witty and fresh with out being overly corny. Written with just enough innuendo and savvy to keep the older viewers smirking. When Bruce Wayne (Batman's alter ego) is seen to be making moves on Superman's main squeeze Lois, Clark remarks, `Of course you have been dividing your time between work and Lois.' Bruce replies with genuine arrogant charm `Is that a problem?' With Deadpan seriousness Clark retorts, `Let's just say I'm concerned. Your reputation is... dubious. In and out of costume.' I dare you to find better dialogue any where on Saturday morning television. The film flows with some modest attempts to flesh out the human sides of the characters but by this point in the evening we are too busy wondering how Lex Luthor's driver/body guard is to be taken seriously in that skirt. This straight to video release is basically the 3-episode arc that marks the pilot from the TV series of the same name. Compared to the last two big screen efforts, this really sets the standard for Batman films, Joel Schumacher should be forced to watch, pen and paper in hand and take notes, gaudy okay nipples bad. Besides some enjoyable action sequences the fun comes in picking the actors who voice the main characters. Mark Hamil, yes Luke Skywalker himself, pulls of a Nicholson-esque joker while Timothy Daly of `Wings' fame does the Man of Steel. What's the bet that Tim uses that fact in pickup lines in bars? Kevin Conroy does Batman. That man must eat cigarettes for breakfast. On whole very enjoyable and fans should watch to see the Man of Steel and the Dark Knight actually done semi well. Though you might get some funny looks from the Video store clerk when you bring this to the counter. Tell him its for your nephew.",
         "This post may contain spoilers : When Superman: The Animated Series made its debut on WB in 1996, I thought it would be great if there could be a team up with both Superman and Batman. Lo and Behold in 1997, my wish came true. Even though it is really a 3 part episode arc called World's Finest, named after the famous comic that teamed these two heroes up, I prefer this story as a full length movie, just like the Superman pilot, The Last Son of Krypton. This team up exceeded my expectations and gave me a team up story that neither Filmation, nor Ruby Spears, nor anything in live action could ever do. I loved the fact that Batman and Superman are not exactly friends, but they are reluctant allies who, although do not trust each other, do have a mutual respect for one another. I also enjoyed their scenes together as Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent. Another exciting event was the reluctant pairing up of the Joker and Lex Luthor. And let's not forget the cat fight between Harley Quinn and Mercy Graves. Another great moment in this movie was the romance that developed between Bruce Wayne and Lois Lane. And if you want to know more, just rent the DVD, or better yet, buy it. It's well worth the price to get rid of her. Beyond this movie, I also loved the two together in other crossover episodes, Knight Time and the Demon Reborn. but World's Finest: The Batman/Superman Movie was a perfect animated story arc of all time.",
         "***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** Before I viewed this movie in 1999, I was really looking forward to seeing two of the best superheroes of all time teaming up. I am pleased to say that it exceeded my expectations and I enjoyed it just as much when I recently viewed it. In various comic books, Superman and Batman teamed up on many occasions. They even had their own regular team up comic called World's Finest. They were always good buddies in the comics. Then in 1986, Superman was relaunched and had a new mini-series called Superman:The Man Of Steel. In one issue, Batman was in Metropolis investigating a crime but Superman didn't approve of his methods and was concerned only with hauling him into the nearest police station. Batman became a darker and darker character from the late 70's onwards and it would be wrong to describe him and Superman as friends. You're probably wondering why I am spouting all this comic book history out. The reason is, because I was pleased to see this movie feature Batman and Superman as reluctant allies as opposed to good buddies. Bruce Wayne is in Metropolis about to do business with Lex Luthor. The Joker also happens to be in town and soon ends up teaming with Luthor to combat Superman and Batman. There are some nice touches to this movie. Bruce Wayne is an arrogant millionaire in this movie who is interested only in dating the beautiful Lois Lane. Wayne ignores Clark Kent throughout the film and acts really condescending towards him at times, almost regarding him as inferior. Kent is jealous throughout the film at the interest Bruce shows towards Lois. Batman and Superman are reluctant allies in this film. Superman clearly does not approve of Batman's methods and Batman has no time for Superman although clearly underneath there is a deep mutual respect. In this film, Superman and Batman discover each other's identities and that leads to some interesting scenes. The Joker (and Harley Quinn) and Lex Luthor are also reluctant allies teaming out of necessity only. The interaction between the two villains is great and Lex clearly regards the Joker as a lunatic. There are some great scenes throughout including one where the Joker gets the better of Superman and Batman throws Superman onto a table (believe it, it's true). Of course, it would have been nice to have Robin in this film but the movie was so great I soon forgot a minor fact like that. All in all, a fantastic film. Rather than taking the easy way out and having Superman and Batman as good buddies punching their way through the bad guys, the makers of this film came up with something very imaginative and totally original. Highly recommended.",
         "Before the review, a brief plot summary: The Joker and Harley Quinn, who have recently been down on their cash, steal a strange \"green jade\" statue from an antique shop called the Laughing Dragon. The dragon is famous because all of it's previous owners have died unexplained deaths. Batman is put on the case, and when he expiriments on a sample from the statue, he learns it is giving off low-level radiation. Bruce Wayne, his billionaire alter-ego, is working on a buisness project in Metropolis with another famous billionaire, Lex Luthor. Clark Kent and Lois Lane are among the first reporters to greet Wayne as he arrives, and immediatly Lane and Wayne become attracted to each other. Meanwhile, Joker has met up with Luthor and shown him the statue which is made of kryptonite, and seals a deal- a billion dollars and he'll kill Superman. Well, here is an interesting crossover! Of two Warner Brothers cartoons, based on DC comics, Marvel's top competition. This feautures all the original voices from the cartoons, like Tim Daly (currently seen on \"The Fugitive\") as Superman, Kevin Conroy (currently playing... Batman, as you can see if you'll click on his bio) as Batman, Clancy Brown as Lex Luthor, Dana Delany as Lois Lane, and Mark Hamill (explination needed?) as the Joker. Let me start this paragraph off by saying that both heroes have suffered a lot of crap recently (ie \"Batman Forever\" and \"Batman and Robin\"; \"Superman III\" and \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\"). Batman has been getting quite some publicity, what with the films \"Mask of the Phantsm\" and \"Sub Zero\". Obviously, Kevin Conroy is THE animated caped crusader, and it's nice to see him again. But, enough with such ramblings. The plot is EXCELLENT and interesting to see how it could work out. As I have just said, it's great to hear all the original voices, together and interacting. The chemistry is great! The conflict between Bat and Super is brilliantly done, and as the plot progresses it gets more and more interesting. Also, the chemistry between the villians is appealing, and with Bruce and Lois... well it's lots of fun. The scenes are fast-paced and exciting, and the climax is amazing. The Joker's \"death\" is a great company to his other demise in the film \"Batman\" with Jack Nicholson. The suspense glues you to it, and the technology is fun. Batman fans will applaud the film, sticking to the original idea and character (a nod goes to Bruce telling Lex \"I don't like guns\"). It's too bad we don't see Bruce getting emotional about falling in love like in \"Mask of the Phantsm\". The special effects and all probably won't break any grounds, and the film will probably be remembered only as a noticeable TV movie from 1998, but I still strongly recommend it. My, we can only imagine what it would be like live action, with Christopher Reeve, Michael Keaton, Gene Hackman, Jack Nicholson, Margot Kidder etc. Ah well, we can still dream... (smile).",
         "THE BATMAN/SUPERMAN MOVIE (ANIMATED) **** It's twice the fun when two of the timeless superheros - Batman and Superman - join together to battle opposite forces. The story has billionaire Lex Luthor (an enemy of Superman) paying the villainous Joker (an enemy of Batman) to extinguish Superman. The secondary storyline focuses on the relationships between hotshot news reporter Lois Lane and both title characters. Most of the fun and laughs come from the scenes with the Joker and his crazed sidekick. Rating System ***** Excellent **** Good *** Fair ** Poor * Bad",
         "Both Batman and Superman are comic icons, having fans that span many generations. The producers of this film are aware of the age differences and have crafted a movie that honors the characters and the people that have kept up with their exploits for decades. \"World's Finest\" is an appropriate title, owing itself to the comic book as well as the place that both Batman and Superman hold in the world of comics. The storyline puts the two forming an uneasy partnership as the \"devilish duo\" of longtime enemies Lex Luthor and The Joker join forces to do away with Superman, with the aid of some decades old Kryptonite. Of course, the two villains have singular plans, unbeknownst to the other but that's the way of \"bad guys\". The animation is first-rate for a television production and the well-written script allows for some witty repartee between all the characters. The voice-over talent is on the money, with Tim Daly fine as \"Superman/Clark Kent\" and Kevin Conroy superb after voicing \"Batman/Bruce Wayne\" for over a decade in various animated incarnation. Additional kudos have to be given to Mark Hamill as \"The Joker,\" Clancy Brown as \"Lex Luthor,\" and Arlene Sorkin, brilliant, as The Joker's loony sidekick, \"Harley Quinn.\"",
         "Being a fan of both Batman & Superman, I really wanted to see how they could possibly come up with a good, interesting, and exciting story between these two superheroes. Well, the writers were able to do just that. With two of the most famous superheroes joined together vs. two of the most infamous villains joined together. Batman & Superman vs. Lex Luthor & the Joker. The action and story are great, but one thing I really enjoyed in this movie that the writers did was that they really displayed the personalities of the characters very nicely and uniquely. Batman's way of fighting crime goes against the way Superman believes in upholding justice, while the Joker's crazy ways of breaking the law doesn't mixes well with the way Lex Luthor handles his illegal businesses. So this is more than an action movie, but a well written screenplay, bringing out the colorfulness and the fun into these classic characters as we get to see them finally interact with each other. This is a much better movie than what Hollywood has produced in the recent years. A must see for all Batman & Superman fans out there."
