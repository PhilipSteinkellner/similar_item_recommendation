         "A realistic depiction of a relentlessly depressing story. Blessed with superb acting and an excellent script. The film may be a rude punch in the face of the viewer but reflection will reveal a film that is visually beautifully orchestrated. Volchock also benefits from an outstanding performance by a child actor who out-performs other good child actors. Her performance is heart-wrenching as everything turns darker and darker, losing colour and light for her an her mother. There is bravery in presenting a film that is relentlessly down-beat with no redemption and no chink of light at the end. SPOILER - the opening scenes may not seem to relate to what follows. But this is the birth of the daughter in the most extreme of circumstances. Watch, listen and follow what then happens in the ever-downward spiral of mother and daughter.",
         "A young woman has an unwanted child just as she is being captured for murder and sent to prison for 7 years. Be it because of her character or because of her being away, she does not develop love and motherly instincts for her daughter. The child is brought up by her grandmother. One day, her mother returns from prison. It soon becomes clear that the young woman intends to carry on with her wild life and will not be tied down by any motherhood obligations or expectations (\"I am young, I want to live!\" she states at some point in the film), while her daughter immediately starts loving her. We are shown a simple and effective story of unconditional love from one side (the child), which does not go away in the face of indifference and even cruelty. A very harsh world seen through the eyes of a 7-year old girl. It could be Russia, it could happen anywhere else. Admittedly, an extreme situation, but unfortunately not the less real for that. A story that may bring some parents to reconsider their relationship with their children. The film explores such feelings as egoism, guilt, responsibility and the impossibility to kill love off in some cases and to make it happen in others. Beautifully filmed. Magnificently acted by the main characters. Both the mother and the child are hypnotic."
