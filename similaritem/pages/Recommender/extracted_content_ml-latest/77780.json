      "synopsis": "The story is set aboard the Phaeton, Earth's first starship, on a ten-year journey to explore a distant planetary system. In order to help the 12 members of the crew endure the long mission, a system of virtual reality modules is installed aboard the starship. These modules allow the crew to assume various identities and enjoy a variety of adventures, until a flaw is discovered in the system. The ship is 6 months into its journey and on the cusp of a \"go or no go\" decision. They are about to make a 'slingshot' move around Neptune and, depending on the course they choose, it will either turn them around and send them back to Earth, or slingshot them out of the solar system, on their way to explore for possible habitable planets and life around the nearby star, Epsilon Eridani. *** SPOILERS !!! SPOILERS !!! SPOILERS !!! *** It is at this point that problems suddenly begin to crop up. There is an unknown problem in the hydroponics section and food production, and production of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide are off a few percent. The ship's doctor is diagnosed with a debilitating, progressive and potentially serious disease, which could render him incapable of taking care of the crew. The captain and chief hydroponics officer are engaging in a 'virtual sexual affair' through the virtual reality module, under the very nose of her husband, the ship's chief psych officer. However, it is this psych officer who also wrote the virtuality program and he may know more than he lets on. Various other problems and personality conflicts are starting to crop up, and the captain himself may be going crazy. On top of all of this, the master computer program which controls the whole ship seems to be listening in to everyone and everything that happens on the ship and among the crew, and it is starting to act a bit erratically and possibly has become inimical to the crew, or at the least might be malfunctioning. (Shades of HAL from \"2001\") The movie opens with the captain engaging in one of his favorite modules, a civil war simulation. The 'battle' in the simulation goes badly, so the captain, who commands a unit in the simulation, freezes the program and asks the computer what happened and why he isn't succeeding in the battle. The computer begins to explain why the captain has failed in this simulation, when, suddenly, one of the supposedly computer generated, simulated characters, walks out of the background, calls the captain by his real name (Frank) and says that the captain isn't fooling anyone, least of all, himself. The simulation character then shoots the captain. Since this is a virtual reality simulation, the captain is not injured, at least physically, but there may be signs of potential problems developing in his mind. This same simulation character starts to crop up in other shipmate's modules and virtual realities. In one of them, he is a doctor taking care of a crew member. In another, the virtual reality character pushes the real ship's doctor off a cliff. The 'simulation' character rapes one crew member in her module, tries to drown another, and shoots the captain and his lover while they are engaging in one of their virtual reality trysts. With all of these problems cropping up, it would seem to be an obvious decision that the mission should be aborted, but it isn't that simple. Since they left Earth, it has suddenly become clear that Earth itself will very soon be facing massive ecological collapse and possibly become completely uninhabitable. Humanity MUST find another place to live. So, though there are clear risks, the risks may be preferable to aborting the mission. In addition, the captain, who is starting to behave more erratically, seems determined to push on, because he likes what he has seen in the actions and activities of the virtual reality system and he wants to make sure it continues to function and that the ship continues its journey. The crew decides to support this, even though some crew members suspect that the people who sent them out may be lieing to them, that things might not be that bad on Earth, and they might have been told about the ecological catastrophe in order to force them to continue the mission. The 'Go' decision is made and the ship enters the trajectory which will send it towards another star. Having made this choice, there is no chance to change the decision. They literally must continue the journey to its end, then hope to return in 9 1/2 years. They no longer have any other option.. But additional problems begin to crop up on the ship. There is a glitch with the antenna which allows them to communicate with earth. The chief engineer of the ship shuts it down and retracts it to effect repairs, but when he tries to redeploy the antenna, the computer says it cannot do so. It simply isn't functioning. Someone on the crew must engage in a spacewalk outside the ship to effect repairs manually. The captain and two other crew members go to the airlock and prepare to leave the ship. While getting equipment, the captain is left by himself, in the airlock, suited, but without his helmet. The inner door to the airlock closes by itself, mysteriously, and the outer door begins to open. The computer says that it isn't in control of this, and can do nothing to stop it. From another control center in the ship, the chief engineer is able to prevent the outer door from opening completely, but the captain is left depressurized. Though they find a way to go in and try to save him, he dies from the exposure to space and vacuum. An inquiry is performed to determine the cause of the incident, and a 'short circuit' is found in the control mechanism for the airlock doors, so it appears to be an accident. Most crew members accept this, but the new 'acting' captain doesn't believe it. He says that it was no accident and someone on the crew has committed murder. Since he doesn't know who, he knows now that he can trust no one. Of course, one possible suspect might be the ship's psych officer. We see him reviewing tape of the last few moments of the captain's life, where the captain can be seen declaring his love for the psych officer's wife. Or it may be the computer, which might be managing the virtual reality program and causing other malfunctions on the ship for unknown reasons. The movie ends, rather abruptly, with the chief hydroponics officer finding the captain's virtual reality goggles, and one of his toy soldiers, sitting on a table. She enters her old lover's virtual reality module. There she sees a character, commanding troops, who looks like the dead captain. she goes up to him and he breaks character and calls her by her real name. He tells her that none of this is real and that, to find out the truth, she will need to \"follow him down the rabbit hole.\" (Shades of the \"Matrix\") We also see the dead captain in what appears to be a previously taped interview, where he says, \"If I kill a character in a video game, am I guilty of murder? I don't think so.\" The credits roll and we are left to Ponder what it all means. Is their whole journey, or significant parts of it really just a virtual reality simulation, and is the captain actually alive somewhere? Did he somehow find a way to move himself into the virtual reality program, and has he 'deleted' his body? Has the computer, or someone using the virtual reality probram taken control of a simulation of the captain, to have him say this? Ultimately, we are not sure what is going on. This movie was originally written as a pilot episode for a TV series, and undoubtedly, more of these questions might eventualy have been answered, but the TV series was never purchased, so the movie must stand alone.",

         "I have heard through the grapevine that FOX, even if it doesn't pickup a show, is contractually obligated to play the pilot on air. So of course FOX doesn't care if it is accurately portrayed or even advertised/marketed since they have no interest in the show. I think this program is more suited for SciFi than FOX. The pilot seemed like an interesting beginning to a potentially more complicated series. Hopefully we will be able to see at least one season on another network that is more suited to the show's style. Most of the characters were easy to relate to, even if a tad trite and stereotypical. As I said before I believe that there is potential here.",
         "For the guy who hated it because it didn't have a satisfactory ending (amongst other complaints). Helllooo! It's a series and I think it left us exactly in the right place. I was quite happy to see the entire two-hour PILOT despite the annoyance of commercials (love my DVDs). Virtual reality is a great science fiction theme. Star travel unaccompanied by starbursts as the ship goes into the (virtually) impossible FTL. Good riddance to warp drive. I thought it one of the better efforts for straight-up SciFi on television. I was bugged throughout trying to place the Commander, so came over here to IMDb to look it up. He played in another fun science fiction (more fantasy, but...) we enjoyed: Amsterdam. I look forward to however much of the series they're willing to show us.",
         "reminds me of Harlan Ellison's \"The Starlost\", but also of sci-fi gems like \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", \"Sunshine\", \"Solaris\"... first impression? Loved it!!! just brilliant! with wonderful characters that I felt deeply invested in - that by the time the gamechanger of an ending came I was left broken and demanding answers! that it just couldn't be!! I felt angry and a little bit betrayed. But mostly I wanted some explanation of what just happened. I didn't want to believe it at first. Then I understood the logistics of producing a Pilot - that sth had to grip you and sth needed to stand out amongst other new shows. On the other hand - this kind of storytelling - providing topics for discussion, for later pondering, for breaking each scene into little pieces of a great puzzle - this kind of storytelling is what I love most. I won't soon forget this little piece of art. please FOX give us more eps of this touching and ingenious new show.",
         "Virtuality is the pilot of yet another \"Long voyage into space\" series. It competes directly against Defying Gravity, another show in the same genre. My first thought was that I would not want to trust my life into the hands of this crew. They're a bunch of wimps. I can not believe that they could possibly be the best that Earth would send on a trillion dollar space voyage. We have a crew of comfort junkies who are not even physically fit. The second officer and chief engineer is in a wheel chair. I am for affirmative action and reasonable accommodation as much as the next guy, but a space ship on a twelve year mission is not the place for a paraplegic. What if something goes wrong? So what are the \"oh so lovey and oh so politically correct\" cliché' gay couple doing on the ship? All I have seen them do is cook, cuddle and complain! And what about the girl who was using a video game on the ship's bridge while on duty? And that leads me to the next complaint. Our crew of futuristic video gamers clearly are having a major malfunction with their Nintendo WII. It's playing its own games with them, and those games involve their own deaths. As the Captain of the ship, I'd order everyone to surrender their 3D goggles and for the system to be used only for authorized and required functions that are directly related to furthering their mission. Instead, they keep on playing until I became oh so bored.",
         "The problem with a science fiction movie/show based off human drama, is that on a mission of earth shattering importance, the crew are almost entirely antagonistic whiny incompetents, who have no business being responsible for a trillion dollar spaceship. Quite early on it becomes obvious that the captain, who is the final decision maker on anything important, is of dangerously low intelligence, and would not be capable of managing an ice cream truck, let alone a 'world saving' space mission. I think real astronauts would find this movie insulting. But the visuals are nice.",
         "The first half hour hooked me. The remaining hour left me wanting for more. This was one of the best sci-fi programs on television in recent years since BSG. I watched it with the aid of my PVR and as soon as the program finished I searched the e-schedule for the next installment. But none was found. And that was disappointing since the ending was just the beginning of this adventure. Will the crew survive their 10 year journey? Did the ship's computer/A.I. kill the commander? Or is there a PhD. wacko on board who'll kill again? (My money is on the computer) Will this mission succeed? Why will Earth's environment become hostile in 100 years? Although VIRTUALITY contains numerous previously explored sci-fi themes and ideas, this revised treatment truly engages the viewer and invites you to stare down the rabbit hole of of your own \"reality\". I think this program is worth the view. I also think it would make a great 1 season 20 episode series. Well done Mr Moore, & Mr Taylor but personally I would have gone with the constant gentle nudge of an electric ion drive vice the pounding thump (\"hit me\") of the nuclear impulse drive. Much easier on any vessel",
         "I think this is one of the most wired SciFi movies i have ever seen, but somehow it gets me hooked up. It makes me want more. It has the Galactica style when it comes to photography. For some people the camera shake was annoying, but it is not used so often. The visual effects are very good. Very interesting cast combination and personality. The virtual part of the show gets a very nice perspective of the human mind, transforming somehow after your own fantasies, thoughts and memories and not only, it actually can control the ship. In conclusion I can only say one thing, try it you have never seen something like it before and you may like it! I rated it 10, but this can change in future if the show gets the wrong way. For now it is promising and it is OK to watch.",
         "I downloaded this without knowing anything (not even the genre!) about it, except that it was a pilot. By the name I figured it might be a sci-fi so the first few minutes were disappointing to me, I hate westerncrap. Frankly, I dunno what all the negative comments are on about. This is a great idea, making a reality show out of a space journey. And it's hard SF too, which is increasingly rare these days. With the BSG makers retreating in Caprica, which is so much lacking in Scifi elements it looks more like Mad Men. It's sad when SF makers really hate SF and don't even understand it. And can we stop being so childish about the technical scientific errors? There's such a thing as artistic license. As long as it's not as bad as adding sound effects to the WTC fly-ins, I'll tag along. Yes, there's the gravity. The only gravity there can be is the one through rotation. And some parts of the ship do rotate, but then floors are where the walls should be and and vice versa. The only movie to get the gravity part correct is 2001 A Space Odyssey and apparently studio execs don't have the money for that kind of integrity anymore (meaning, we don't wanna cut into our personal bonusses), even with faaaaaaar more viewers and more money spent on film-making. This is a great idea, especially the murderous villain in the virtual worlds etc. It's sorta brave, with killing off the Designated White Male Hero in the first episode. This is what LOST wanted to do, but ultimately didn't dare to do. And they have profited from it, does this mean that Virtuality will suffer for it? We don't know. Also cool: This might be the first time in TV-land that we see a mature gay relationship, although one of their lines spells doom: \"I don't wanna be an interstellar punch line\". Seems that's exactly what they're gonna be. So three couples, and plenty of possible other hookups, cheating. I see a lesbian relation between Sue Parsons (Clea DuVall) and Billie Kashmiri (Kerry Bishé) rearing its beautiful head real soon. It would have been better if this had developed over time, but hey. All in all, a good setup, interesting potential story lines, great developments ahead. I expected something less diverse from Fox, this looks more like an HBO production and casting. Who knew?",
         "This TV movie or plot if it ever continues has a special touch to it that makes it really enjoyable and i have to say i really got stuck with it after watching a while. Even though it may become an enjoyable series it still has it's flaws I'm afraid, this whole reality show thing they're trying to put in does not make any sense to me, kind of lowers the quality etc, and then we have the \"The whole world is going to end\" thing, we've all seen it to many times and it does not necessarily make a show more exciting, could have the opposite effect in fact. If this actually continues as a series i'd for one want to see some changes for the better, at least i would hope that they could just remove this reality show thing because it makes me think of all the stupid reality shows out there which makes me want to puke a 100 times over, i think that reality shows should stick to reality shows, the same with fiction shows and not trying to put these together because the outcome would be obvious. Anyhow, overall it was pretty decent, the sci-fi feeling about it made it to be worth watching, the ending here did its part and i hope for a following series",
         "If future episodes are going to be like the pilot, 30 minutes of material stretched to 2 hours, then this is going to be one bumpy ride. Plus, anytime our astronauts are together, they all talk at once, and yell, too. Still, the virtual reality side of things could be interesting, plus the mystery of who's doing what to whom. Do we have another HAL9000 here, a saboteur, or is mission control the bad guy? Another down side is I've gone two hours into this without liking any of the characters. That's not a good sign. On the other hand, I've gone two hours into this without turning it off. That's a positive sign. I'll wait for another episode and see how that goes."
