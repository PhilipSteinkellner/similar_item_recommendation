         "This restored silent film features a love triangle involving a Kiowa chief's daughter and ensuing conflict between Kiowa and Comanche villages. There are a few early films that claim to be made by Indians, with Indians, for Indians. This might be the first feature, and it certainly is the only one screened privately for President Wilson. But what makes it stand out is not its historical significance, but what happened to it after. Besides a few small screenings, the film was not seen... and then vanished. That it showed up many decades later and in such fine condition is incredible. We have movies that are presumed lost and either never turn up, or are found as mere snippets with incredible damage. This one is a bit of a miracle and re-writes the history of Indian cinema. (And I mean Native American cinema, of course.)",
         "I thought that I was going to find it very interesting when I read the reviews. I was excited to watch a film produced by Native Americans as I had not seen one before. This came out in 1920 and it is a silent film. I have not watched many silent films before. I did watch one that I found entertaining so I was unsure whether or not I would like this movie. I couldn't watch much of it. I just found it too boring. I couldn't even really follow the film at all. It did seem sweet and the main character was beautiful but I just could not watch it without falling asleep. I may try to watch this film again in a few months or a year and see if I change my mind and am able to get into it.",
         "(Flash Review) Two young Native American men both have desires for the Chief's daughter Dawn. As an act of bravery the Chief says both men must leap down a rocky hillside and the survivor, if any, can have Dawn's hand in marriage. One jumps and gets injured while the other chickens out thus he is expelled from the tribe! Harsh!! He comes back to seek revenge\u0085.what'll happen next. Strange little story and lightly amusing. Some Indians on horseback actually heard a herd of buffalo; that was cool. Overall, too many long distance shots that lacked detail and emotion. Some interesting moments.",
