         "content": "The Film Noir of the Week is Fallen Angel -- the 1945 film directed by Otto Preminger. The cast includes Dana Andrews (Boomerang! (1947) and Laura (1944), Charles Bickford Brute Force (1947), Linda Darnell Hangover Square (1945), Anne Revere Secret Beyond the Door... (1948) and John Carradine Female Jungle (1954), Bluebeard (1944)\r\n\r\nThe film begins with a car speeding down the road with the credits zipping by as super-imposed street signs. The camera pulls back and it\u2019s revealed that it\u2019s a bus. Dana Andrews gets pulled off the bus because he doesn\u2019t have enough cash to get to San Francisco. (he\u2019s about 150 miles short). He walks over to Pop\u2019s Eats (now a noir icon with those great \u201cBEER\u201d signs out front) and he runs into a group of men looking for the waitress Stella. Apparently every man in town has a crush on her. So begins a twisted tale of Eric Stanton \u2013 a former New York press agent down on his luck so much that now he's a drifter (and he'll soon be a con man). After Stella returns (the sexy Linda Darnell) to the diner (to the relief of Pops and others) Stanton cons his way into an empty hotel room to sleep. Its professor Madley (the great John Carradine) and his assistant\u2019s room and Stanton talks his way into helping them get their show publicized. Madley is a traveling soothsayer grifter. When Stanton hooks up with Madley and his spook act he meets Clara and June Mills (Anne Revere and Alice Faye) two suckers Madley wants to take.\r\n\r\nMadley puts on a very entertaining séance by bringing up the finances of the late Abraham Mills \u2013 the father of Clara and June. The two leave the séance upset.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Stanton falls in love with Stella. She\u2019s as bad as Stanton. She likes to take money from Pop\u2019s cash register. After a quick romance Stanton decides he wants her. She refuses to marry him because of his poor financial condition. Desperate for money, Eric marries the wealthy local spinster June Mills, whom he plans to quickly divorce. Clara sees through the scam but is unable to stop the romance. Stanton can\u2019t stay away from Stella even on his wedding night. Instead of sleeping with his wife, he visits Stella.\r\n\r\nJust as he's about to dump his new wife, Stella turns up dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMark Judd (Charles Bickford), a hard-bitten ex-cop turned detective, investigates the murder that first leads to one of Stella\u2019s ex-boyfriends and after a police-style beating of the suspect finally leads to Stanton.\r\n\r\nStanton flees to a seedy hotel room in San Francisco, with June at his side. He quickly abandons her after taking her money, but he returns when word reaches him that June has been charged with Stella's murder.\r\n\r\nI won\u2019t give away the ending but its fun.\r\n\r\nI think Preminger didn\u2019t have chops of other, more talented, noir directors (as far as visual style goes), but this film - with all the fluid camera movements - looks great. Joseph LaShelle (The cinematographer for Laura) does his usual excellent work. The film\u2019s shadowy world is just right. As with all Preminger films, the women look fantastic. Notice Stella\u2019s long legs when she first comes back to Pop\u2019s. From what I\u2019ve read online, most don\u2019t buy the prim and proper Alice Faye or the crazy twists at the end of the film. I, however, enjoy it greatly maybe because of the constant broken desperation Stanton is in. I also enjoy the contrast between the night-time Stella and the sunny day June; and the seedy side of town compared with June\u2019s suburban neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWritten by Steve-O",

      "synopsis": "Eric Stanton (Dana Andrews) walks into Walton, California when he is ejected from a cross-country bus when he can't come up with the fare. Stanton is a down-and-out press agent with a baggage full of cynicism. When he wanders into a local diner he meets Stella (Linda Darnell), a god-digger waitress who has come back from some bust up with a bad boyfriend. Stanton manages to talk his way into promoting Professor Madley (John Carradine), a performing mentalist who is scheduled to perform a show in town in the upcoming days. When Stanton gets involved in promoting Madley, he meets June Mills (Alice Faye), a wealthy, cultured young woman who lives with her older sister. Stanton is intrigued by the raw sexual appeal of Stella but is also drawn to the homey nature of June and he stays in town neglecting the offer from Professor Madley to travel with him as his show promoter. When Stanton makes a play for Stella she makes it clear that he must offer her marriage and a good life before she'll open up to him. June is also interested but her appeal from the start is far more substantial as a spiritual bond that also includes marriage. Stanton tells Stella that he'll marry June, get her money and come back, so he and Stella can go away together. Stanton and June marry much to the dismay of June's sister. When on their wedding night Stanton runs off to a liaison with Stella, she rebuffs him, and he returns to June patiently waiting to take him back. Mark Judd (Charles Bickford), a retired cop from New York, settled in Walton appears the next morning to question Stanton about Stella, as she was murdered the night before, shortly after Stanton had seen her. After brutally interogating Dave Atkins (Bruce Cabot), one of Stella's regular boyfriends, Judd focuses his attention on Stanton as the murderer. Stanton leaves town for San Francisco with June by his side. As they hole up in a cheap hotel, June and Stanton are finally able to find common ground, and Stanton understands how and why he must change his ways. June is picked up by police and returned to Walton, and is charged with Stella's murder. When Stanton returns to Walton he confronts Judd with new evidence to free June and point to the real murderer.",

         "I agree with virtually all that has been written about this film. It is true that Alice Faye's part seems to be less than fully fleshed out. According to Alice, who was a dear friend of our family for many years, the reason she left pictures in a huff following her initial screening of the film was because most of her finest scenes were left on the cutting room floor. Zanick perceived an opportunity to beef up Linda Darnell's part by downplaying Alice's character. Zanick was having a romance with Darnell and wanted to give her part more prominence than the writer or Preminger intended. His ploy worked, but Alice was indeed so furious at what she perceived as sabotage to her part, she left the studio that very day and never returned. Since this left her in violation of her contract, Zanick saw to it that Alice was not hired by any other studio. As a consequence, she and husband Phil Harris turned to radio in the Phil Harris Alice Faye Show for eight years and it was a major success. When Alice did agree, after fifteen years away from the screen, to appear as Pat Boone's mother in the remake of State Fair. Again, she was disappointed as the director Henry King, whom she had been promised would do the film, was reassigned and the film given to Jose Ferrer, who had never been to a state fair or directed a film. Thereafter Alice appeared only in a few bit parts and left screen roles completely. But, I think Alice under-appreciated the work she did in Fallen Angel. The critics were not that hard on her, but she really wanted to make a major success in a dramatic role and unfortunately that didn't happen. The film, however, is very much worth seeing and has never been available on video previously. Hindsight is a wonderful thing.",
         "There is so much to say about the way Otto Preminger directs a movie. His previous success, \"Laura\" (1944), was a blockbuster, but lacked the murky influence of film noir that was so popular during this time. Sure there was some film noir technique employed in \"Laura\", but not enough. However, \"Laura\" still holds it's own even by today's standards and the media, along with the marketing people, have done us all a favor (this time!!!) in keeping this classic alive and popular. Needless to say, \"Fallen Angel\" redeems Preminger's ability to present a film in the classic noir of it's time and because of this is competitive with Billy Wilder's \"Lost Weekend\" (1945) and \"Double Indemnity\" (1944), both huge successes with audiences. But what about \"Fallen Angel\"? Despite the cinematography and the super cast, \"Fallen Angel\" went to the chopping block via the critics. The critics rated this film as mediocre and audiences stayed away. Alice Faye, in her only dramatic role, left the movies in disgust partly because of what the critics did to this film. Why? From beginning to end, the viewer is treated to some of the best cinematography that this art form had to offer. The way sluttish Linda Darnell is depicted before the camera is a treat for the eye and enhances her sexuality. The way Percy Kilbride is smitten with Darnell throughout the movie, up to the climax is an essential link to the continuity of the movie as well as with the novel by Marty Holland. The way Charles Bickford sits behind the lunch counter, slowly sipping his coffee sending a message to the viewer that something deep inside him is simmering, ready to explode. We all know that Bickford, along with Kilbride, Dana Andrews and Bruce Cabot all are victims to the whims of the dark Darnell. And the way the blonde, good and virtuous Faye is contrasted with the dark, bad and selfish Darnell is more proof that this film should be marketed for the masses. The plot is strong, the camera work of Joseph LaShelle and, especially the film direction by Preminger rates this movie as one of the best of it's time. Yes, this film rates up there with \"Laura\", \"Double Indemnity\" and \"The Lost Weekend\"; all three super classics from this era and available on VHS and DVD. Why not \"Fallen Angel\"?",
         "Otto Preminger rarely gets credit for being one of the founding fathers of film noir; in addition to this film, there's of course Laura, and Angel Face, Where the Sidewalk Ends, the Thirteenth Letter, and other films with a heavy noir influence (Man with the Golden Arm). Fallen Angel's least interesting aspect (interestingly) is its murder plot. The tainted, ambiguous relationships that Dana Andrews forges when he drifts into a California coastal village make this film a dark study in romantic pathology. It also features Linda Darnell at her most sultry and mercenary; Alice Faye (her only appearance, I think, in the noir cycle); John Carradine; Charles Bickford (as a policeman with a past); Ann Revere (whom most of us think of as a tenement mom to John Garfield); and even Percy Kilbride before his Pa Kettle days. Andrews' very layered tension between rich good gal Faye and gold-digging bad girl Darnell keeps the viewer off balance all the way through.",
         "This neglected film noir gem by the great Otto Preminger is better and more poetic than Preminger's previous classic \"Laura\". For one thing, Preminger's fluid camera work and long takes here reach perfection, pointing them toward his mature long takes and objectivity in 1950s with such dazzling masterworks as \"Where the Sidewalk Ends\", \"Angel Face\", \"Anatomy of a Murder\". Each scene is shot and elaborated with precision, with minimum amount of edits to elucidate the emotions of the characters. Also, Dana Andrews, with all his unique ambiguity and minimalism, turns in one of his finest performances ever; just a hint of his outstanding performance (and probably his best) in \"Where the Sidewalk Ends\". Andrews' co-stars Alice Faye and a sluttish Linda Darnell are great as well. The magnificent chiaroscuro photography by Joseph LaShelle has certain crispness and lucidity that is similar to Anthony Mann's \"T-Men\". Some may find the second half of the film quaintly melodramatic and David Raksin's romantic score is admittedly less memorable than \"Laura\" but \"Fallen Angel\" deserves to be seen and viewed within its credentials. The effect is haunting and breathtaking.",
         "Sure, 'Fallen Angel's' plot is full of holes and improbabilities - but what noir isn't full of them?! Indeed much of the appeal and frisson of the genre stems from its tales' and characters' nightmarish, inexplicable irrationality. The almost always underrated Dana Andrews is superb here in a brilliantly understated performance: by posture, tilt of head, and deft deployment of his eyes he communicates more than most actors manage to tell with their whole scenery-chewing bodies; and Alice Faye kept me guessing: was her June the \"still water runs deep\" character whodunit? Most of all there's 'Fallen Angel's peerless camera-work and direction that raise it a notch or two above the rather overrated 'Laura' - whose plot sometimes drags and which is chiefly rescued by the literate, finicky presence of Clifton Webb; and Gene Tierney's mannered, diffident, and albeit mysterious Laura isn't half the hard-boiled noir femme fatale that Linda Darnell's Stella is in 'Fallen Angel.' There's another lovely, understated effort here from Bruce Cabot and still another from Percy Kilbride; but in the supporting cast Anne Revere stands out for moving the plot along, for creating tangible suspense, and for two solid moments of palpable nape-prickling foreboding. 'Fallen Angel' is just one of the most underrated noirs. Period. Just one question I'd like to put: when Dana Andrews enters the hotel auditorium during the spook show, is the blonde woman, seated on the aisle one row behind the brunette (Adele Jergens, uncredited) woman Andrews asks to shift over, his future 'The Best Years Of Our Lives' co-star Virginia Mayo? She sure looks like Mayo. By the way, the recent 'Fallen Angel' DVD release commentary track by noir maven Eddie Muller is gracefully enhanced by his pairing with with Dana Andrews' daughter Susan Andrews.",
         "Many film critics have glossed over this wonderful movie. It is an engrossing story about a man (Dana Andrews) who marries a woman (Alice Faye) for her money, but seeks to kill her in order to inherit her fortune and hook up with vamp Linda Darnell. The movie is star studded. It not only features Andrews, Darnell and Faye, but spectacular performances are made by Charles Bickford, Anne Revere and Bruce Cabot. The movie is a typical film noir with a catchy plot. Otto Preminger makes great use of lighting to portray the typical murky image found so often in a hard boiled, sex-money drama as film noirs were meant to portray. It is a shame that this movie is not available on video.",
         "The star player is Alice Faye. She gives a superb, if slightly overstated, performance. This is the only movie of hers I've seen, as musicals are generally not my thing. Here she is vulnerable but strong and exceptionally appealing. The rest of the cast is good to excellent also. Charles Bickford is superb in a somewhat formulaic role. Dana Andrews gives a performance he gave often but that is good. Ann Revere is properly menacing as Faye's older sister who doesn't approve of what she's doing. Linda Darnell is good but something isn't right about her. Maybe I prefer seeing her in a more favorable light. She was such a charming, beautiful actress, it's hard to think of her as a bad girl. And, essentially, that's what she plays here. Who wants to think of her as calculating and cold-blooded? The real star of \"Fallen Angel\" is its atmosphere. We have the usual drifter, a somewhat incongruous big-city cop, and the usual smalltime denizens in the small town where it takes place. A mood of doom hangs over this town and we sense that from the very beginning. The cinematography is first-rate. The script is a little predictable but very literate. It's not \"Laura\" and, though the public at the time may have expected it to be, I don't. But it falls short of the top rung of noir. And yet -- It will haunt anyone who sees it. It's not easy to shake off.",
         "Otto Priminger was basking in the sun as a result of his classic film noir \"Laura\" when he followed up with this highly under-appreciated film. The key element is basically the same as in \"Laura\" and that key element is obsession with a beautiful but dangerous woman. The femme fatale of film noir is present at the creation of the genre, here embodied by Linda Darnell. Many men become obsessed with beautiful women who are not deserving of such adoration. In its perverted form obsession leads to stalking. In its most common form it leads to heartbreak and mental torture. It can also lead to murder. Why do men become obsessed with dangerous beautiful women? Ask your shrink for an analysis. Alfred Hitchcock made the best film on obsession with a beautiful woman, \"Vertigo.\" Before \"Vertigo,\" \"Fallen Angel\" was the best and is still one of the best. The acting is marvelous, especially Dana Andrews, Linda Darnell, and all those wonderful character actors that Otto Priminger hand picked for their roles. The weakest performance is by Alice Faye, but then she is out of her element and badly miscast, not at all a good choice for a film noir. Plus my understanding is that Priminger cut many of her key scenes to make more room for the machinations of Linda Darnell. The shadowy world of midnight rendezvous, dark tones of shades of rain, a diner called Pop's Eats, all make for a classic film noir for fans and non-fans as well.",
         "Otto Preminger used 20th Century Fox stars - Alice Faye, Linda Darnell, and Dana Andrews for \"Fallen Angel,\" a film noir about a drifter who falls for a sultry waitress. Since Linda Darnell's heyday was the 1940s, and she has now been dead for 40 years, her name doesn't appear on lists of all time beauties, but she was surely one of the most beautiful women ever to appear in films. Here she plays the object of many mens' affections, Stella, a slutty waitress in a coffee shop. Dana Andrews, passing through town, becomes obsessed with her, and in order to get money, he marries the wealthy Faye. He promises Darnell that he will rip off Faye and her sister to give Darnell the life she wants. Then Darnell ends up murdered, and Andrews becomes an instant suspect. One thing about noir films that has always troubled me is the ease with which women fall for these nasty guys after about three seconds. It happens here as well, with Faye just gone on Andrews after one date. The genre has been done better, but still, the film holds one's interest and is well done if not exciting. Apparently the ravaging it received by the critics caused Alice Faye to leave film work for some time. It was a nontraditional dramatic turn for her, and apparently some of her scenes were cut in favor of Darnell. Despite it not being Preminger's best, it's worth a look.",
         "Otto Preminger liked using Dana Andrews in his film noirish melodramas and, while this one is not quite up to the classic \"Laura\", it's a well played story of a drifter (Andrews) who comes into a small town and cons a decent woman (Alice Faye) into marrying him although her money is what he's after. Seems he's intent on ditching her in order to marry the town siren, Linda Darnell. When Darnell is murdered, he becomes a prime suspect until the true killer is unmasked. Alice Faye gets a straight dramatic role for a change and is effective enough in the part. When the film was edited, some of her best scenes were cut in favor of footage given to Linda Darnell. Faye quit the Fox lot, vowing never to return. Years later she did for \"State Fair\". Linda Darnell excels in her role as a tart and the supporting cast includes veterans like Charles Bickford, Anne Revere, Bruce Cabot, John Carradine and Percy Kilbride. The ending is somewhat of a surprise unless you've been playing detective and catching the hints. Dana Andrews adds another tight-lipped portrait to his gallery of rogues. For more about this fine actor, watch for my career article on DANA ANDREWS in an upcoming issue of FILMS OF THE GOLDEN AGE."

Unfortunately, right after the wedding, Stella turns up dead, and the blame is placed on Eric.",
