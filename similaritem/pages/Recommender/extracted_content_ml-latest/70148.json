         "John Wayne's sixteenth and final picture for Lone Star Films was the only one directed by Carl L. Pierson. In the story, Wayne's character John Wyatt joins a traveling medicine show to expose a band of counterfeiters; one suspects that the phony money men might be part of Doc Carter's (Earl Hodgins) bunch. Instead, it's a crew run by Curly Joe Gale (Yakima Canutt), who was once the Doc's partner before Carter got busted for the counterfeit scheme. You'll get a kick out of the coach at the center of 'Carter's Greater Medicine Show', I can just picture similar get ups heading from town to town to ply the local rubes. Carter has a pretty but naive young daughter Linda (Marion Burns), who doubles in the show as Princess Natasha. However the entire affair is pretty much a vehicle for selling 'Doc Carter's Famous Indian Remedy', and at ninety percent alcohol, it's pretty potent stuff. As for the real bad guys, government agent Wyatt eventually gets the drop on Curly Joe, with a posse of Mexican rurales chasing down Curly's gang in the finale. It's all wrapped up quickly in just about fifty three minutes, perhaps the shortest of all the Lone Star pictures. Having now seen all of the Lone Star's, a quick recap reveals that stunt man extraordinaire Yakima Canutt appeared on screen in twelve of the sixteen films in various roles, sometimes as John Wayne's sidekick and often as a henchman. On three occasions, as in this film, he portrayed the main villain. The others were \"Sagebrush Trail\" and \"'Neath Arizona Skies\". Even though he didn't appear in \"Paradise Canyon\", George Hayes showed up in eleven Lone Star's; back then he wasn't known as 'Gabby' yet. Earl Dwire tied Hayes with the same number of roles, however he was one up on Hayes with an uncredited bit part as an Arizona sheriff in this one, but you'll really have to keep your eyes peeled to spot him. All of Wayne's Lone Star films were filmed between 1933 and 1935, and are quite easily available today, most if not all in the public domain. They can be had rather inexpensively, either alone or in compilations, and they're a great way to see one of movie's greatest stars before he became a household name. Your first viewing will probably give you the same impression I had, marveling at how young and handsome Wayne appeared while learning his craft. By the time of his breakout characterization as the Ringo Kid in John Ford's \"Stagecoach\", Wayne had appeared in a little over fifty films, starring in most, while patiently awaiting the role that would make him an overnight success.",
         "I really liked this little film. It has to be one of the best of the early John Wayne b movies. The writing isn't to bad as Wayne is a lawman who joins a traveling medicine show to sniff out a suspected counterfeiter. He meets a really cute girl and its obvious that Wayne was enjoying himself a lot while making this movie. The actor that plays the \"doctor\" was a real hoot, a very fine job he did indeed. He reminded me a lot of Walter Houston. Very similar acting style. There are several nice touches with this film. In one scene a posse chases down the medicine show crew. What makes this unusual is the fact that the posse rode horses and the medicine show bunch were traveling by truck!!!! Course it was a pretty sorry excuse for a truck mind you! Another cool thing were the songs played by the medicine show performers. Pretty cool old tunes there. Course i had to laugh when Wayne was doing trick pistol shots like snuffing out candles that were inches from the girls head. I'm sure a real father would have gone for that, ha. Supposedly the \"doctor\" was her dad. Overall, this is a very fun old movie and i got a kick out of it. Oh yeah, there is also an exciting chase and shootout at the end between the bad guys and a Mexican posse. Pretty darn well staged i must say. Great movie, a classic old b western with da duke!!!! Much better than Randy Rides Alone or Star Packer which were also on the DVD.",
         "In Paradise Canyon, John Wayne is a federal man looking for some counterfeiters. Suspicion is falling on Earl Hodgins, the feds are circling in on him. Looks like the work he was sent to prison for a 10 year stretch for. Hodgins back in the day operated his racket from a carnival medicine show and the medicine show has been started up again. Wayne helps Hodgins skedaddle out of town and in gratitude Hodgins lets Wayne join the show as a trick shot artist. Of course Hodgins's daughter Marion Burns is also quite the distraction for Wayne. With some detective work and a little help from the Mexican Rurales, the Duke uncovers the real counterfeit mastermind. Paradise Canyon has a weak story line and the VHS copy I viewed wasn't particularly good. However this particular film was stolen by Earl Hodgins as the garrulous carnival man. Hodgins is quite good in a part usually reserved for Gabby Hayes in these Lone Star Productions.",
         "John Wayne and a couple of reasonable action scenes are about all that keep this B-Western afloat. The plot is mildly interesting, with Wayne working undercover trying to break up a counterfeiting ring. But it strains credibility a little too often, and the goofy medicine show settings, while occasionally amusing, cause at least one too many groans. The action scenes are OK, thanks to Wayne and Yakima Canutt, who plays the bad guy. Wayne was still progressing as an actor himself, and would later have much more of a screen presence, but he was obviously above most of the material in this movie. The film itself is really only interesting because he was in it, and it gives you reason to be thankful that eventually he was given a chance to move on to better things.",
         "After enjoying Blue Steel.I went on to watch this,and i feel this is a really under-rated forgotten gem. The plot: John Wayne is told by the U.S. government to stop a counter-fitting scream that some people in Mexico are helping do.Wayne is told by the U.S. government that they think the main people involved are the travelling \"mediciine sellers\"(The \"Medicine\" is a drink that has 90%00 alcohol in it!)The Carter family is not as involved in the problems as he had thought.But he and the family get in trouble when some fake \"stolen\" iteams are planted. View on the film: Screenplay/Direction.The screenplay was by Robert E Mmett and it gives a really good feeling of Wayne and the Carters becoming really good friends as time goes on.The director is Carl L.Pierson.The thing Pierson does well is to have the plot move along really well,while not taking anything out of the friendship and building the tension. The cast:The cast really work well as an ensemble and you really feel a good friendship between them all. Final view on the film: A really good,sadly forgotten film.",
         "I agree with all the positive reviews but I do have the original movie and some idiot(s) have removed all the original soundtracks and have substituted some truly ghastly, awful music - all the same for the those '33-'35 Westerns. My advice? Watch and listen to the real originals on your IMDb/computer and not the rubbish that is being played on Encore/Autry Western station. For fans of the original movie(s) the changes made to the music are absolutely offensive. The old John Wayne westerns-before STAGECOACH are terribly important because they always pursue the ethical and attempt to do the right thing. Law and order is understood to be clear cut. Whilst we have been in this day and age, encouraged to see all sides of an issue, when evil is clearly defined-which it was in the John Wayne westerns, there was the feeling, that right MUST triumph and if John Wayne was starring, you knew it would be-because it was his mission to ensure that right was the result. Trivial in a career? No! Wayne didn't compromise his values. Thank heavens he always sought to portray a good guy in his later films as well. He set a great example for us all. Just a footnote: When I attended law school as an older adult, I was the only student to pass a legal ethics class taught by a judge! It was thanks to those principles taught by Wayne, Wild Bill Elliott, Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, et. al., that I think gave me that remarkable A!",
         "Like a slew of John Wayne B-movies recently aired on the Encore Channel, this one features a god-awful new musical track that practically ruins the film. The music is too loud, the wrong type of music, is played on modern electronic machines and is the exact same musical accompaniment you'll find on at least a dozen other Wayne films! Yes, the exact same sound track is used again and again! Also like a slew of other Wayne films (as well as Gene Autry films now that I think of it), the film is set out West and while MOST of it looks like it was set about 1880-1890, there are tons of anachronisms! The leading lady wears modern dress and they drive about the west in a truck!! Oddly, in this and other films, when it comes to chasing the bad guys, they don't chase them in a car or truck but on horseback! It's all very bizarre but not terribly uncommon in cheap B-westerns where they often just didn't care about these details. Wayne is looking for a traveling medicine show, as he's a good guy investigating some counterfeiting ring. Instead of confronting the crooks at the show, he joins them and does trick shooting to attract customers. At the same time, he naturally falls for the boss' pretty daughter. Eventually, it turns out that a baddie named 'Curly Joe' is behind the phony money scam. No, this is NOT the same Curly Joe who was the really lame third Stooge in the late 1950s and 1960s. This film is not among one of the best films of the era for John Wayne. While none of the films had very high expectations, they were moderately entertaining and fun. This one, however, was a bit duller than usual--mostly due to no interesting sidekick and an amazingly dull villain. The stunts are decent but there just isn't much to this one to make it anything other than a mediocre B-movie.",
         "For fans of Lone Star-Wayne only. It's a pretty slender installment from our friends at Paul Malvern's production company. Wayne's an undercover G-man on the trail of counterfeiter Yakima Canutt. On the way he hooks up with medicine man Doc Carter (Hodgins) and his sloe- eyed daughter (Burns). We see a lot of the medicine show and some of it is a hoot�The Texas Two whose down-home ditties are memorably corny. But reviewer Chance is right: Hodgins takes up too much screen time for a brief 50-minute feature. Too bad producer Malvern didn't pop for a location shoot at scenic Lone Pine. That would have compensated for a lot. Instead, the boys have to ride around the scrubby un-scenic outskirts of LA. He did however pop for a well-staffed chase scene at the end. Then too, there is the usual hidden hideout that fascinated Front-Row kids like myself, along with a dramatic plunge off a cliff. But the sum-total is rather plodding and not up to the usual high-action standard. (In passing� sorry to say I counted 3 \"trip-wire\" induced falls, which make for a dramatic tumble of horse and rider, but is unfortunately often fatal to the horse. Happily, these stunts were eventually banned. On a more upbeat note-- for a really entertaining look at how these Saturday afternoon specials were made, catch Hearts of the West {1975}.)",
         "John Wayne's final Lone Star cheapie has him playing a government agent with a huge hat trying to bust up a counterfeiting ring. He does so by joining the traveling medicine show of Dr. Carter (Earle Hodges) and his pretty daughter Linda (Marion Burns). They always had a pretty daughter in these things. Anyway, the bad guy's named Curly Joe. He's played by stuntman extraordinaire Yakima Canutt. At least you know the stunts are good. Hodges is fun as the medicine show huckster. There's also quite a bit of comedy and some songs including one about suspenders that needs to be heard. Is it just me or are those the loudest horse clops you ever heard? Also, I'm not sure what era this was supposed to take place in. Lone Star wasn't known for caring about historical accuracy in these cheap B westerns. There were usually shots of telephone poles and the like in the background. Here there are 1930s-era cars and clothes but everything else says Old West. This western, like the other B's made in the '30s, will seem pretty much like kids stuff today. But there is some fun to be had with it. Fans of the Duke might want to check it out. Avoid the version with the bizarre modern electronic score added.",
         "John Wayne is on the trail of a counterfeiting racket, and joins a medicine show in order to trick the bad guys. He falls in love with the daughter (Marion Burns) of the alcoholic owner (Earle Hodgins), and races frantically at the conclusion to prove that the guys always come out first. There's plenty to enjoy in this very short western comedy, and Wayne is at his low-budget best. We've seen him do this before, and some of the low grade westerns he did prior to \"Stagecoach\" are much better than others. This is one of the better ones. Hodgins proves that alcoholics can be funny (even if it is medicine he claims he is taking, 90 percent alcohol included) and Burns is a sweet, likable heroine."

         "Robert Emmett Tansey never wrote a plot he didn't get at least five versions out of over a period of 15 years or so, and this one is no exception with \"Arizona Days\" and \"Harmony Trail\" among the remakes. Government agent John Wyatt is searching for a counterfeit ring operating on the Mexican/Arizona border and joins Doc Carter's traveling medicine show as a sharpshooter. Since Carter was recently released from prison, Wyatt is keeping one eye on him and both eyes on his daughter Linda who performs as \"Natasha\" in John's shooting act. But Doc is searching for the former partner who framed him with the counterfeiting charges that unjustly sent him to prison. That man was Curly Joe Gale just up the road a piece in Los Piedros. Gale frames Wyatt and while he is escaping from the sheriff, Gale abducts Doc and Linda. Wyatt eludes the posse and crosses the border to get extradition rights from the Mexican Rurales Captain. The Captain has had his own man, Miguel, watching Gale and he promises Wyatt his government's support.Wyatt is mistakenly arrested by Mexican law officers while Gale heads for the Old Paradise Mine where he has the Carters prisoners. Will Wyatt get free again and arrive in time to save the Carters?"
