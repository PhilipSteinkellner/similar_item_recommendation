         "The whole movie had a visceral feel to it. I could, believe me, feel the swelt of the Florida swamp. The boy is amazing. The scene, where he stands over the bridge, ecstatic after his escape, is stunning. So where some other characters. If u can suspend yr judgement on the ending and want to \"feel\" the movie go for it. very sensual.",
         "This movie feels astonishingly like you are watching a documentary. The first time I caught it I thought I was watching Gummo, or some documentary. Like a documentary, sometimes plot structure is there or isn't. That disappointed me a bit but the second time I was willing to cut it some slack, and just take it in. I finally understood that this is a remarkable achievement. I prefer it without structure now. Movies which kick you between plot points never have a prayer of achieving anything this natural. So you don't recognize where you are at any point. Guess what? the other ninety nine percent of movies released any year are for you... Ryan, the sweet dumb teen of the movies focus is drawn to serial distractions and fleeting moments with no sense of the impending squalor that awaits him unless he can develop a longer attention span. This IS exactly what suburban adolescence is like. I remember being this frustrated, aimless and nihilistically hopeless. The suburban environment adults provide young people are desolate, unstimulating places of abandoned dreams, or dreams in holding patterns while the bills are paid. While that rubric is getting worn out in film, this treatment is very fresh. Truffauts 400 Blows covers the aimlessness of boyhood in a similar way.",
         "This is a very good and honest movie. You feel how this kid felt, and I especially relate because I used to just walk around as a kid (but obviously not as a convict or something.) You really feel for the main character in this movie, it has its own feel to it, very real. Very honest. Its not so much a movie as an experience, like a doc. film but real. Its certainly worth the watch. I saw it and it grabbed me enough to stay there, watch it and forget what I was doing. Any film that can do that has achieved it's goal in bringing you into the realm of cinema and is worth the watch.",
         "This film reminded me of the Iranian film \"White Balloon\", in the following sense. In White Balloon, the whole plot is \"two kids go to buy a goldfish, and a bunch of stuff happens to them along the way\". That's it. Nothing else. There isn't necessarily any point to any of the stuff that happens to them. There isn't any theme. There's just... lots and lots of stuff. And then the movie just ends. In the same way, this movie is: a kid escapes from juvenile detention, and a bunch of stuff happens to him while he's on the run. And then the movie is over. What's the point? No point. If you can get PAST that, then there's a lot to enjoy here. This, in spite of the fact, that as another commenter pointed out, there are lots of technical flaws in the cinematography, that might *appear* to be intentional, \"for effect\", but are probably just goof ups or inexperience. However, in between the out of focus shots and the \"unsteady-cam\" shots and the underexposed shots are some really interesting sequences and very nice use of music to create mood. To really enjoy this film, change your expectations: see it as a series of 3-5 minute \"mini-plays\" that all happen to revolve around the same character, Ryan Kazinski. And then, just to watch this young actor, Ryan Daugherty in his first feature film, is a real treat. Especially heartbreaking is the scene between Ryan and his brother (played by his real life brother, Jon Daugherty.) I expect that after some casting directors see this film, the phone may be ringing in the Daugherty household.",
         "The combination of sounds, acting, and the story in this film make it a small masterpiece. I loved the tension one always gets with an anti-hero. I also got a real sense of time and place--the temperature, day and night, the feel of a long night--despite this film''s short length. This film lands on my top ten list.",
         "the music in this movie is completely mesmerizing, it brings you into the protagonists world....ryan daugherty is an impressive actor, not to mention f***ing hot, and i cant wait to see him act in other films....i can relate to how he feels in the film, it makes me wonder if ryan really felt what he seemed to be, or was he just portraying the character? julian, the director, did an astonishing job, the camera work was surreal throughout the movie. you have GOT to see this if you like trance, ambient, techno music.....i wish i could get the soundtrack...",
         "I loved this, a a fantastic soundtrack helps take us through a few days in the life of a 16 year old Ryan Kazinski in a Florida Juvenile Detention, early on a fight breaks out between two boys, while their out picking up trash on the highway. While the guards rush to break them out, several boys just take of running in all directions, Ryan is among them. Its not til they're halfway in the swamp do any of them stop to consider what their doing. It wont come for Ryan til halfway into the movie, when his brother asks \"why did you run? You only had a month left?\", and he responds, \"lets not talk about it. Doesn't matter now\". Whatever stupid thing got him locked up, is now rivaled by his equally stupid attempt at escape. His father is never mentioned, and his mother lives in another state he thinks, he and his younger brother who visits him in detention both aren't sure. Once he escapes, freedom includes sitting on the porch with some old guys in front of a gas station, getting beat up in a parking lot for stepping on someones bear bottle tops, listening to fellow escapees free-style, a robbery at a dog pound and stealing a puppy, huffing aerosol out of cool whip in the supermarket, night swimming, evading the police, and visiting his younger brother in turn(the emotional heart of the film). What he does isn't whats impressive about this movie(most of the time hes either a child or an idiot), its the way its shown, the use of music, sound, camera, and voice over, that makes so engrossing. Style over substance maybe, but I prefer to think the movie itself, enriches and exceeds the narrow confines of the story, as all good films should. And now the comparisons: rambling voice over from Terrance Malick, music from Morvern Callar and Paranoid Park(which I wouldn't doubt Van Sant saw before going on to his film), story ala Down By Law, some white trash moments from Harmony Korine(with more compassion and less freak show). But those are its references, and scarecly give you sense of how exhilarating and exuberant the whole thing is. There's little dialog, and the story feels plot less at points, but by the end, every visit and encounter has had consequences on another. If there is a message to this(if there must be), maybe its that even the seemingly meaningless and impulsive decisions made always have consequences later, but they can richocet to worse, just as well as to better. The ending may seem under-thought to some, but I appreciated that it didn't devolve into another muddled indie tragedy. Instead it took off into the clouds. This movie resonated with me, even its unevenness and flaws. I was mesmerized from the first frame to the last. Like southern fried, french new wave. I really, really want the soundtrack. Beautiful and hypnotic.",
         "I'm not sure if I was watching the same movie as everyone else. The premise was interesting but the story went absolutely nowhere. The `Cinematography' was terrible. All hand held with hard zooms and pans sometime with with late focus which appeared unintentional. The shots were all ill thought out and the dialog seemed as if it was all improvisation (and bad improvisation at that). There was quite a bit of narration in the first 15 minutes, which just dies with the rest of the film somewhere in the middle. You don't get to know or care about any of the characters. However, there were some very interesting editing and musical soundtrack choices but in the end good editing and music does not a good movie make.",
         "TRANS begins very promising, with an unusually natural acting style and equally unusual cinematography. With a documentary feel, we follow the adventures of a boy escaped from a juvenile detention center. His encounters are interesting and believable, but after about 80 minutes or so, the story just stops. What happens to the boy? We'll never know. Maybe we're not supposed to know. However, good storytelling involves a beginning, a middle, and an end. This film has no end, and therefore no story arc. This is a good first two acts of a film, but without a third act, there is no film.",
         "With one month to serve out a Fort Myers, Florida juvenile prison term, teenager Ryan Daugherty (as Ryan Kazinski) joins two fellow inmates as they spontaneously escape from a road cleaning crew. After enjoying some fresh freedom, the other two lads desert young Mr. Daugherty. Left to his own devices, he is unable to cope. Daugherty can't differentiate between those who try to help him and those who would get him in deeper trouble. After visiting little brother Jon, he becomes determined to visit their long lost mother. Julian Goldberger's \"Trans\" is a semi-documentary, film festival friendly effort. The story's beginning is very good, with Daugherty's boredom and alienation nicely visualized. His natural and convincing narration gives the film a voice, and would have been welcome throughout the film. Although \"Kazinski\" presents as a rather ordinary, confused, and probably unintelligent soul, his plight elicits sympathy. However, a series of unspectacular and/or improvised events squanders much of film's initial appeal. An uplifting ending helps. ***** Trans (9/11/98) Julian Goldberger ~ Ryan Daugherty, Justin Lakes, Jon Daugherty, Michael Gulnac"
