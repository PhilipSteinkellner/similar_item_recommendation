When 13-year-old Kyle Vogel discovers the World War II footlocker belonging to his grandfather, Bud, everyone tells him to put it back. Luckily, he ignores them. Although Bud has never talked about the war, he finds himself striking a deal with his grandson: Kyle can pick any three souvenirs, and Bud will tell him the stories behind each one. As Kyle reaches into the footlocker for objects, we journey through Bud's World War II combat experiences as a member of the 82d Airborne in Holland, Germany and the Ardennes Forest of Belgium. But we also move into the future (actually the present) by seeing Kyle's wartime future as a Minnesota \"Red Bull\" in Anbar Province, Iraq. As the movie shows the parallel experiences of two men, in two different time periods, and in two different wars, we come to see how that magical day on the porch helped shaped both of their lives.",

         "Memorial Day is not meant to be a \"war\" movie, it is a Veteran's story. Made with Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans, the intent was to convey to our families and friends the impact on the soul of going to war. It is not meant to glorify war, everyone who goes there comes back a lesser person in some ways. Enlightened yes, but all too often hardened also. Being a Veteran of several campaigns I don't see myself ever opening up to my immediate family but someday with time and a bit of distance from those tours of duty will be able to relate some of it to grandchildren as \"Bud\" Vogel/actor James Cromwell, the Grandfather in the movie did. This movie was helped by a lot of really good people helping to make it this far, and graced by historically significant WWII aircraft. The P38 Lightning is one of only a half dozen flying in the world, the P51 Mustang is one of only a handful that actually flew combat missions in WWII. Fagen Fighters of Granite Falls, Minnesota must be thanked for that. It was made with the invaluable contribution of the WWII Historical Reenactment Society, and many local MN Iraq Veterans used as background actors. It is a story of great significance, and if we can get it told I feel it will do immeasurable good in helping Veterans and their families come to terms with our current return to civilian life. And not least of all, it is a respectful homage to our passing WWII Veterans. In 10 yrs they will all virtually be gone. Our hopes are that the movie will help them, and Veterans of all wars, pass on their first hand experiences and witness to history.",
         "\"Promise me no matter what I tell you I'll always be your Opa.\" While Kyle Vogel (Bennett) is at a hospital recovering from a wound he got in war his nurse begins to ask him about his life. He decides to tell her about a talk he had with his grandfather (Cromwell) when he was 13. This is another movie that I thought could have been either really good or really boring. I wasn't sure how a movie about a grandfather telling his grandson about war artifacts could be any good. After twenty minutes I was absolutely hooked. I really connected with this movie on a personal level as my grandpa was also a vet and always wanted to ask him about what he went through. I only heard one story and after hearing it I never asked again. That aside, this is one great movie that deserves to be watched. The acting buy Cromwell is Oscar caliber and he deserves to be nominated for this, but like most low budget movies it gets glossed over because of the budget. Which isn't fair at all. I highly recommend this movie and is in my top 10 of movies released this year. Overall, a must see movie that will leave you choked up at the end. I give it an A.",
         "Unlike many war films, this film does more than just portray events and effects of active duty. This film goes further than blood and bullets. is a film which embraces family, and intertwines the family aspect into war. This film is (excuse the cliché) one-of-a-kind. Bennett does an excellent job portraying a young, determined soldier. James and each do an outstanding performance and really tie movie together, really embracing the feel of family (even though they both portray same character but in different times). I highly recommend this film to ANYBODY. Whether you like war films or not, this movie is more than that. This movie, in a way, is every genre. Horror: giving realization of war events and after effects. Suspense: it keeps you on edge of your seat-- it keeps you wanting more. Comedy: some cute quotes which lighten mood after enthralling dramatic scenes. Family: it brings together a sense of love and support. And Romance: in a way, it is a love . You just have to open your heart to hear it. Ten out of ten cannot describe the quality and love that this movie is composed of.",
         "This is a great family movie, a good movie to watch with the family. It has a lot of great family values. This movie almost made me cry, \"Bud\" reminded me of my grandpa that passed away a couple year ago. this movie reminded me of the good times me and my grandpa had. The main actors did a great job but the side actors were not very good and it bothered me. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, if you like war movies or not. This is not really a war movie it is more about the memories and how it changes people. It is about family and friendships. James Cromwell did a very good job. There is some life lessons in this movie, you do not want to take life for granted. Stories live on forever... if you tell them to someone.",
         "I was lucky enough to see a screening of this film, and was blown away. To echo the reviews below, it's more than a war movie, it's a family movie. The movie crosses multiple generations, and encompasses stories from two wars. For those from the WWII generation this will bring back their own memories from a time with the war was very much part of their daily life. For those with loved ones serving now it gives a real face to what is happening. For everyone else it's a solid reminder that memories are stories that need to be shared, that burdens can't be carried alone and that all generations have something to give to one another. Additionally, it teaches us that Memorial Day is more than a time for picnics and BBQ, more than just a free day off and a parade but that it's a day when we honor and remember. I strongly recommend this for anyone, not just those with military ties.",
         "I really enjoyed the movie, and appreciate a war film thats family friendly and sparks conversation. Memorial Day gave a touching portrayal of how serving our country touches us all... The men and women who serve, the ones waiting at home, the mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, kids, grand kids, and friends. As a fan of James Cromwell, what a treat to see his son - a spitting image- play him as a young man (great actor too). Great to Finally watch a war movie that goes beyond the battlefield scenes. As someone who has family who are Veterans of WWII, Korean, Vietnam, and Iraq (big family), I plan to go back and ask those still living about what's in their footlocker. Maybe the answers will help us in a way that provides insight, healing, and connection. Great movie, and not just for war-buffs or Veterans. Well done!",
         "In the interest of full disclosure, I do know some \"principals\" involved with the making of this film, and was on location to watch a few scenes being filmed and met most of the cast. With that out of the way. Seriously, what these people did, from a conversation, to an idea, from concept, to an LLC, bringing in the key actors, etc. They did not just \"make a movie\" to say \"hey, we made a movie.\" With limited time, limited location, limited funds, they took a great screenplay which the actors obviously enjoyed, executed their performances to the best of their abilities. They followed through on the cutting room floor, with the Audio and with the Digitization. BEAUTIFUL! Again, come full circle to the wonderful screenplay, and the performances of the Cromwell's. I loved the movie. I will own it and I will watch it every Memorial Day for my remaining years. Kudos to the entire cast/crew!",
         "What a movie! This movie isn't just a story about two wars but how both those wars affected the lives of two people. James Cromwell (Bud Vogel)is at his very best and his son John Cromwell (younger Lt. Bud Vogel)is what many would say is \"a chip off the old block\". Jackson Bond plays the young grandson Kyle Vogel while Jonathan Bennett plays Kyle as a grown man. The acting and portrayal of the participants is superb in every detail. The story deals with flashbacks of war and torment and drives home the need to understand. It may be hard for me to tell you about the movie without spoiling it for you so I won't get into too much detail other than to tell you to sit down in a quiet room and watch this movie with an open mind and heart. Saving Private Ryan brought a tear to these old eyes of mine and I have to admit the same thing happened to me while watching this movie. So a box of tissues may be an added item to have nearby.",
         "Well directed, excellently photographed, superbly acted this well scripted movie is a mover - and that's what I watch films for, to be moved, to be taken to another place in my imagination or experiencing that can release feelings and emotions within me that touch upon the core of my 'humanness'. This film performs this task, and more, beautifully. I watched it 4 nights ago and have since watched 3 more movies, yet I find myself consistently and continually being drawn back into Memorial Day. My memory keeps thrusting this back into my consciousness. There are some wonderfully subtle family moments, ebbs and flows, currents and undercurrents, that are so honestly representative of most families. The family setting is very recognizable for most people. I am 68 and I can recognize many characters I have known in this film.They are clearly identifiable. It is,thankfully,not a 'shock and awe' film, but rather a very believable journey through the experiencing of 3 generations and the determined power of children to seek answers.Memorial Day is truly memorable.",
         "Very mild spoilers dealing with the plot. Should not ruin the movie if you choose to view it. This movie is tastefully and eloquently executed in telling the story of a grandfather and grandson who both experience the ugliness of war, two generations apart. It addresses in part why so many veterans do not talk about what they witnessed. It touched me in several ways. Those who watched with me sometimes laughed, sometimes cringed, and occasionally shed a few tears. This is the best performance I have seen from James Cromwell. He was very convincing as the grandfather reliving painful memories with a curious grandson who would not take no for an answer. The boy found a chest full of souvenirs on memorial day and wanted to know what they were and why grandfather kept them. Inside most veterans of war there are two personalities. One is the \"protector\". He or she cannot speak of the ugliness experienced because that would expose loved ones to the horror of war they intend to shield them from. Neither do they want loved ones to know the violence they were capable of. I learned that from my father but did not fully understand until he was gone. I became a protector myself after Vietnam. Fighting a war on foreign soil in the hope it would never come to my home land. It still goes on to this very day with new generations. The other personality is the \"avoider\". He or she is the one with the hidden psychological wounds that need to be healed but the veteran is unwilling to talk about it. Afraid to let the monsters out as if they lived in a \"Pandora's box\". The vet is fearful the demons and ugliness might be overwhelming. And the memories can be very painful so they keep them suppressed. When my father learned I was to be drafted in 1966 he spoke to me of only a few things he witnessed in WWII. I suspect he wanted to prepare me mentally for what I was about to experience. Even then he could only reveal small bits of information. Most decent men and women who experience war do not want to talk about it because it is ugly. There is no glory in war itself. Only in the halting of cruelty is there glory and honor. This movie deals very cleverly with the experiences of veterans. It addresses war rather factually revealing how sad it is to watch someones life slip away much too soon. The murder that occurs in wars is always random, it is just a matter of bad luck that one soldier aims at the person next to you and you are spared. Or that you are only wounded and sent to be \"repaired\". Purely random, lousy, luck. The horror of war does its damage to the emotional, psychological part of the human. Decent people are sometimes forced to make choices in war that they would NEVER make other wise. And the pain of that lives with them till death or until the memories fade due to something similar to Alzheimer's. I can wholeheartedly recommend this movie for the way it addresses some most important issues. It may not be suitable for young ones because a few of the scenes being relived in the memory of the veterans get quite realistic. This is a good movie, part of me wishes it was required viewing for 12th grade students."
