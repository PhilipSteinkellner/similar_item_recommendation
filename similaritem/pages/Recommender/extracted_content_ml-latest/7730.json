         "This has to be the most under-rated, under-valued and criminally under-seen film of all time. Funny, touching, nostalgic in a good way, a wonderful tribute to the very joy of film itself and, the clincher, a cast of kids that never get on your nerves. And even in any of the Coen Brother's films he has been in, John Goodman has never bettered his performance from this movie. If you love the movies, you'll love this film. See it; then see it again and again. It really is the undiscovered artistic masterpiece of the 20th Century.",
         "`Half Man, Half Ant, All Terror!,' screams the promotional for fictional film producer Lawrence Woolsey's newest film, Mant. Mant is the film within the 1993 film titled Matinee. Matinee, starring John Goodman as the William Castle-like Woolsey, is director Joe Dante's valentine to all of us who grew up in the middle of the cold war. That he has managed to combine a salute to the science fiction films of the 1950's and early 60's with a warning about nuclear power and human imperfection is quite impressive. The plotline is straightforward. Woolsey and his delightful lover, leading lady and all around Girl Friday Ruth, ably played by Cathy Moriarty, (who shows she could have been a great 50's sci-fi heroine), roll into Key West, Florida for a sneak preview of his latest film, Mant. The weekend of the big event, autumn of 1962, also happens to be the time of the Cuban missile crisis. Here the story gets a little stretched as we try to keep up with all that is going on. Panicky theatre managers, adolescent love and jealousy, and several amusing scenes from Mant are among the many points of interest against the sobering backdrop of the missile crisis, only 90 miles away in Cuba. This film is a bit hard to describe, the best thing to do is rent it and enjoy it for yourself. Much of it takes place in the theatre on Saturday afternoon and is a true trip down memory lane for old guys like me who lived during this era and remember very well what indoor theatres were like in 1962. Mant is a special treat for all of us who love the sci-fi films of that era. It has several un-credited science fiction legends in it (Kevin McCarthy, William Schallert and Robert Cornthwaite appeared with the sultry Moriarty) and numerous insider jokes. McCarthy was `General Ankrum.' Oh Brother! Is there a sci-fi fan anywhere who is not aware that the late Morris Ankrum made a career of portraying military generals in these types of films? This is only one example of a ton of fun in this film. There were other appearances by old time favorites, such as Jesse White and Roger Corman regular Dick Miller. It is obvious that everyone had a good time making Matinee and just about all of the performances are way over the top, especially Goodman's. He held his oversized stogie just like Castle used to. I've heard that there are more Mant scenes in the DVD version of Matinee but I have been unable to locate what has turned out to be a harder to obtain film that I imagined it would or should be. Matinee is a warm-hearted gem. By all means make the effort to see this one if you can obtain a copy. I promise, you will not be disappointed. The Strand Theatre, where the `action' takes place, has a big Milk Duds ad over the snack bar. Hmm . . . sounds like an idea to me!",
         "I had just recently watched Matinee for the first time in a few years. I forgot how much fun and how very funny a film it was. Having grown up watching some of William Castle's and Roger Corman's hokey but very entertaining early horror films it was like a stroll down memory lane on my Saturday's. Goodman captured the essence of a movie showman who always had or wanted to have a gimmick to go with his B movie pictures. Cathy Moriarty is excellent as his favorite leading lady. I must be showing my age because I still remember the duck and cover and other little things associated with everyday life and times during the late 1950's and early 1960's that were in the movie. The movie was entertaining and a very nice parody, if not dedication to the men who made B movies as part of our culture. I have to believe this dedication to men like Corman and Castle would have to be a bit of a tongue in cheek parody for it to be a very sincere dedication. The movie does an excellent job of bring back the life and times and the performances as pretty good. Aaaahhhh the memories. The cold war and much simpler times and classic B movies. It don't get any better than this.",
         "This movie explores the marketing and the premier of a B-movie horror flick by a virtual one-man studio (remember American International?) in, of all places Key West during the Cuban Missile Crisis. I think this was intended to be a vehicle for John Goodman as the B-movie \"impresario\" Lawrence Woolsey (great casting!), with Cathy Moriarty also excellently cast as the jaded B-movie starlet and Woolsey's companion. Simon Fenton plays a young, wide-eyed, horror movie addict who is also a military kid, whose father has just been assigned to the naval blockade around Cuba. The cast also includes Dick Miller from the Gremlin series, and many other B-movies since the 1950's including the original Shop of Horrors. Matinee is quirky, and the \"movie within a movie,\" called \"Mant\" (half man, half ant), is about a silly accidental \"mutation\" of a man into a rather large insect The movie contains a good sampling of all the plot devices (on screen and off screen) used in these sorts of movies. The now-hilarious atomic horrors depicted in \"Mant\" are juxtaposed against the real-life horrors of the nuclear missile crisis, with interesting effect. Matinee also offers a lot of not-so-subtle counterpoints between the atmosphere and common wisdom of the era (anybody remember Civil Defense drills? Bomb shelters? The \"four\" basic food groups?), and its stark comparison to what we know/think today. When this movie was made, the cold war was just over, and a look back to the pervasive feel throughout the 50's and 60's and its worrying about the \"bomb\" and anti-commie lingo makes the people of this era look supremely paranoid and silly, until one thinks about how even this has changed since the movie was made (think post 9-11: who's silly and paranoid now?). The movie is enjoyable on many levels, although I feel the comparisons between the 60's and \"today\" could have been made a bit more subtle. As a counterpoint, my wife, who was never a fan of the horror movie genre, dislikes this movie--she also disliked \"Ed Wood\" for the same reason. All in all, it's a wonderful movie that I'm glad to have in my VHS collection.",
         "One of those films that deserved to reach a huge audience but somehow slipped away, Joe Dante's affectionate homage to creature features and B-movie king William Castle is a joy from start to finish. This is due to both Dante's direction - and obvious love of the script - and John Goodman's delightful performance (what was he doing in crap like \"Coyote Ugly?\"). Even the movie-within-a-movie - \"Mant!\" (\"half man, half ant - all terror!\") is fun. The only downside is that this rarely turns up on TV and hasn't been released on DVD in the UK. A scratchy vhs is better than nothing I suppose...",
         "Yes, the atomic bomb is terrible. But unintentionally funny were some of the movies about the alleged effects of atomic mutation. Hi, I want to tell you about something that could have happened. Something that does happen in a certain movie. Picture Key West, Florida: your average American town. But, if a movie about the alleged effects of atomic mutation was brought there during the Cuban Missile Crisis...the result would be hysterical indeed. For the result...would be...\"Matinée\". This movie is a real treat for any fan of the sci-fi/horror flicks of the late '50s and early '60s. John Goodman plays B-movie producer Lawrence Woolsey, bringing \"Mant\" (Half Man...Half Ant...All Terror!) to Key West, Florida, during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Naturally, the possibility of a nuclear attack heightens the mood in every way. \"Matinee\" just may be the perfect movie about the adult world as seen from a youngster's point of view. And I don't just mean the great soundtrack. I think that it's safe to say that this movie has something for EVERYONE. Joe Dante has created another cool movie here. And of course it wouldn't be a Joe Dante movie without Dick Miller. He and John Sayles play representatives of Citizens for Decent Entertainment protesting \"Mant\" (or are they?). Kudos also to Cathy Moriarty as Ruth Corday, the actress who in the movie-within-a-movie plays the wife of the human-to-formic star; bravo also to Kevin McCarthy, playing the general in the movie-within-a-movie trying to stop the Mant. All in all, this movie shows why the word \"cool\" was invented.",
         "I have a lot of time for Joe Dante. Most of his movies are fairly light-hearted, nostalgic fare aimed at kids or the young at heart, but unlike his occasional collaborator Steven Spielberg he really pulls it off convincingly without getting too sentimental and treacly, and always has enough in-jokes and references in his movies to amuse diehard science fiction and horror film buffs. Dante is a BIG fan of film makers like Roger Corman (who gave him his big break), William Castle (a major inspiration for 'Matinee') and Mario Bava, while one has to wonder if Spielberg even knows who they are. 'Matinee' is a slight, but very entertaining picture, concerning b-grade 50s/60s horror movies, and fans of that era will absolutely love it. John Goodman ('The Big Lebowski') plays flamboyant writer/director Lawrence Woolsey. Woolsey's gimmicks and showmanship are inspired by William Castle ('The Tingler', '13 Ghosts', 'House On Haunted Hill',etc.etc.) though the fictional movie 'Mant' which is part of the plot is quite unlike Castle's output and closer to 50s paranoid monster movies like 'Them!' and 'Tarantula'. Goodman is perfectly cast and loads of fun. I also really liked Cathy Moriarty ('Raging Bull') as Woolsey's leading actress/assistant. The chemistry between the two was enjoyable and made for some nice comic touches. The young kid actors were all pretty good, and Dante regulars Dick Miller ('A Bucket Of Blood'), Kevin McCarthy ('Invasion Of The Body Snatchers'), Robert Picardo ('Star Trek Voyager') and William Schallert ('The Incredible Shrinking Man') seem like they are all having a wonderful time. Trivia buffs note that this movie includes an actor from 'The Thing From Another World' (Robert Cornthwaite) and also one from John Carpenter's remake 'The Thing' (David Clennon'). The movie within the movie 'Mant' is hilarious, but I enjoyed the whole thing. 'Matinee' is another fun movie from the underrated Joe Dante.",
         "This isn't such a very well known film (at least I never heard of it before I watched it) and actually that is a god-awful shame, as \"Matinee\" is a joyously vivid, versatile and refreshingly imaginative little comedy. \"Matinee\" is director Joe Dante's ultimate tribute to typically 50's Sci-Fi B-movies and massively promoted gimmick-laden low-budget flicks; particularly the repertoire of the legendary William Castle. In one of his most glorious roles to date, John Goodman depicts the unscrupulous and sleazy horror movie producer Lawrence Woolsey, who is practically the reincarnation of William Castle, what with his sly and shameless salesmanship techniques and continuous wide-mouthed smile. At the highpoint of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, Woolsey jaunts out to Key West \u0096 where the Navy and population hectically prepares for a bomb attack \u0096 in order to proudly present his newest and supposedly most shocking motion picture named \"Mant\". \"Mant\" is a silly shock feature about a man slowly mutating into a gigantic ant after being exposed to nuclear radiation, and for the big premiere Woolsey stuffed the film theater with horrid decorations and gimmicks to raise extra fear in the audience. With the threat of actual bombing attack going on outside the theater, Woolsey bumps into a lot of protest and resistance from the adult population in Key West, but luckily the younger and horror-crazed generation are wildly enthusiast about the upcoming matinée preview. With \"Matinee\", the still incredibly underrated director Joe Dante delivered another delicious and charming movie. The extended bits and clips from the fictional movie \"Mant\" masterfully capture the essence of 1950's B-movie cinema, with grotesque ideas and effects, cheesy nonsensical dialogs and wooden acting performances. The real William Castle actually never made such a type of monster movie, but the gimmicks and promotional stunts (like buzzers underneath the seats and guys in rubber suits running around) are right up his delightful alley! But \"Matinee\" is a terrifically clever movie on other levels as well. Apart from a wonderful homage to horror cinema, it also contains an admirable \"coming of age\" sub plot and it effectively parodies the mass hysteria going on around the time of the Cold War. Whilst the adult population of Key West practices their duck & cover bomb alarms and prepare their shelters, the teenagers are more concerned about finding a date to go see \"Mant\" on Saturday. The acting performances are fantastic (like his monster \"Mant\", John Goodman himself is larger than life!), the decors and atmosphere of the early 60's are marvelously re-enacted and \u0096 in good old Joe Dante tradition \u0096 there are multiple cameos of horror veterans, like Dick Miller, Kevin McCarthy and Robert Cornthwaite. This is truly a film meant for genuine horror movie buffs, but nevertheless a stupendously enjoyable comedy for all type of audiences.",
         "Gene Loomis is a teenager living on a naval base in Key West in 1962, just as the Cuban Missile Crisis occurs and worldwide tension mounts. At the same time, Lawrence Woolsey, a schlock moviemaker, is premiering his new monster movie, Mant!, at the local theatre. Gene meets Woolsey, who teaches him some tricks of the trade, and Gene and his friend Stan go to the premiere which involves, amongst other things, a mad beatnik in a giant ant costume, Gene getting locked in a nuclear fallout shelter, and Woolsey destroying the entire theatre. This is a lovely nostalgic movie brimming with funny dialogue and movie in-jokes, brilliantly written by Charlie Haas and featuring wonderfully offbeat characters. It was clearly a great labour of love for the filmmakers and it celebrates not only a bygone age of innocence before the great social upheavals of the sixties but also an unqualified love for the imaginatively nutty fantasy movies of the time. Goodman is simply terrific as Woolsey (loosely based on producer William Castle) - a big kid whose greatest joy is to entertain people but who also has an astute business sense. At one point when he receives a letter threatening legal action over an unpaid bill he says, \"Boy this business has changed. These things used to be settled with violence.\". Everybody in this movie is tremendous though; all the kids are great, particularly Fenton and Jakub, who make a lovely chalk'n'cheese pair of misfits. Moriarty is a scream as a long-suffering starlet and the great John Sayles (who wrote two of Dante's early movies) has a wonderful little role as a blacklisted writer turned phony morality campaigner. All of Dante's regular stock company have funny bits (Picardo, Miller, Balaski, Hahn), as does writer Haas as a school teacher. Schallert, McCarthy and Cornthwaite are all hilarious and feature unbilled in Mant! (Half-Man, Half-Ant, All-Terror !!), the movie-within-a-movie, which is a lovable and gentle pastiche of the giant ant movie Them. The film also features a wonderful score by Jerry Goldsmith and beautiful Florida location photography by John Hora. There are lots of reasons to like this movie very much, and it's beautifully made, but most of all it simply entertains from start to finish.",
         "Joe Dante is a true enthusiast for classic sci-fi and horror films. His affection for the genre shines through in every film he's made. Matinée may be the best example of that, because this lovingly crafted homage to classic schlock merchant William Castle not only succeeds as an entertaining feature, but also as a knowing commentary on the changing attitudes of our time. Set in 1962, during the peak of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Lawrence Woolsey (the ever engaging John Goodman), a director of schlocky horror and SF films, has come to Key West, Florida, to promote his latest film, MANT. Undeterred by the looming tension, Woolsey intends to use it to his own advantage to encourage people that MANT is a once in a lifetime experience. For 14 year old Gene, one of Woolsey's biggest fans, his arrival is a far more important event than the CMC, while most of the townspeople are swept up by the paranoia and increasing tension. Eager to attend the matinée of MANT, Gene goes along with his best friend Stan (Eerie Indiana's Omri Katz) and his younger brother Dennis. But when the gimmicks Woolsey has cooked up for the preview get out of control, the people in the cinema believe World War III has finally broken out, and chaos erupts. Matinée may be Dante's most good-natured film since Explorers, and also one of his truest to date, because of Dante's own affection for the genre that is clearly mirrored in Gene's character. Gene is a horror/SF aficionado, he collects all the classic magazines, and when Woolsey comes to town, he makes every effort to meet him. John Goodman gives one of his best ever performances, clearly enjoying himself immensely, chewing on the scenery, he almost seems like a carnival barker announcing his presence to the world. This feeling is perfectly complemented by Jerry Goldsmith's charming musical score. Joe Dante obviously feels a kinship to Woolsey's character, who in turn was modelled on William Castle. Woolsey may be a bit of a con man, who employs tactics such as wiring electrical buzzers to the seats to make the audience jump on cue, or hiring people to condemn the film when actually they work for him. This works on the level of reverse psychology, ensuring that people will attend the screenings. But Woolsey is also a man who enjoys his work, and takes pride in it. I get the same impression about Dante. He is a man in love with the SF/horror genre, and although his films only do moderate business at best, it is clearly a genre he feels most at home in. Cathy Moriarty also proves a scene-stealer as Woolsey's long-suffering girlfriend Ruth Corday. She doesn't share his enthusiasm for his films, although she is totally professional when she stars in them. She is also a good sport when asked to pose as a nurse at cinema screenings, having people in the audience fill out health forms in case they suffer heart attacks from the scares on show. MANT, the film within the film, is a classic example of inspired lunacy. Looking like King Kong blended with The Fly, it shows that Joe Dante really knows his stuff in this field with the cheesy lines, the hammy special effects and the total absurdity they represent. The events on film are also nicely juxtaposed with what is going on in the real world. With the CMC raging out of control, the events of MANT seem to reflect what is actually going on, and is a good trick on Dante's part, tying in his trademark genre in-referencing to the plot. Most importantly, that despite the building chaos, Dante never loses focus of his characters. Things never become mawkish between Gene and his friends, not even when they're going out on first dates. Matinée also captures perfectly the era, such as the insane Duck and Cover program, and people buying bomb shelters to prepare for the end of the world. Matinée may be the closest Dante has ever come to making a serious film. But it never loses it's sense of fun. It's quite a touching film really, because it shows how the world has become too cynical for it's own good. Where we can't appreciate anymore the simple pleasures of hired people in monster costumes running through the theatres. Matinée is a film that celebrates the cinema experience, and Dante wants to share that experience with us. An underrated gem of a bygone era."
