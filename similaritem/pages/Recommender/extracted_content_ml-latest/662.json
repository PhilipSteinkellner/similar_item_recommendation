         "content": "Fear can hold you prisoner\u2026\r\n\r\nFear is directed by James Foley and written by Christopher Crowe. It stars Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon, William Petesen, Alyssa Milano and Amy Brenneman. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Thomas Kloss.\r\n\r\nOne of the number of psycho-sexual thrillers that surfaced in the 80s and 90s, Fear has the narrative hook that it involves teenagers. Witherspoon is the girl who invites drifter David McCall (Wahlberg) into her life, only to find he\u2019s as unstable as unstable can be. Director Foley and his team then produce a film that pretty much cribs from a number of other similar themed movies. All of the key scenes will be instantly familiar to genre film watchers, and unfortunately the plot twists and turns come as no surprise.\r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of the lack of originality in structure and narrative thrust, Fear is never dull, not even when Wahlberg is wistfully looking into Witherspoon\u2019s eyes like a love sick puppy. Suspense is on hand for the big finale, which unfolds with kinetic brutality, and it\u2019s also nice here to find that some thought has gone into the characterisations of those in peril. Kloss\u2019 photography around the various Seattle locales is vividly appealing, as is Burwell\u2019s music compositions, while the acting performances are all on the good side of good, with nobody harming the balance of the piece.\r\n\r\nA teenage Cape Fear \u2013 cum \u2013 Straw Dogs - cum \u2013 Fatal Attraction, but good with it regardless. 7/10",

      "synopsis": "Nicole (Reese Witherspoon) is a fairly innocent teenager but with a rebellious side, particularly directed at her father, Steven Walker (William Peterson). At a rave, Nicole meets David McCall (Mark Wahlberg), and is swept off her feet by his sweet, polite nature. Steve, seemingly overprotective, doesn't trust David from the moment he meets him. Steve also gets angry when Nicole violates her curfews to spend more time with David. The closer Nicole and David become, the more Steven objects. One day, David scares Nicole when he sees her hugging her friend, Gary. He physically assaults Gary and shoves Nicole to the ground when she tries to stop him, leaving her with a black eye. Nicole ends things with David, leaving him crushed. The next day, he talks to Nicole, apologizes, and things are smoothed over for the couple. Nicole clings to David and he uses that to his advantage since he knows from their conversations about the tension between her and her father. He is more than happy to comfort her in every way. Steven is still suspicious so he does some checking into David's background and finds out that David is not who he appears to be. Steven confronts David on a street corner and orders him to stop seeing Nicole. David is still polite and says he has no intentions of hurting Nicole. Then he taunts Steven about wanting to keep his daughter a little girl forever and that he was scared David will take her away from him. He also says that Steven's wife isn't satisfied sexually and implies that she has been coming on to David. Steven is only interested in protecting his family and drives off. David doesn't take orders very well. David beats himself in the chest repeatedly until he is bruised, and Nicole accuses Steven of assaulting David. She leaves in an angry rage with David, who was waiting in the car outside. Later, David drops Nicole off, asking if she'd rather come home with him. Nicole declines but then changes her mind and drives to his house where she discovers Margo giving David's friend a lap dance. David then interferes and grabs Margo from behind and takes her to his room, proceeding to rape her, but Nicole believes Margo goes willingly. Nicole is devastated and completely breaks it off with David, wanting nothing more to do with him. She also doesn't want anything more to do with Margo. Later that week, David follows Nicole into a ladies' room in the mall and molests her. In a final, desperate attempt to get evidence to use against David, Steven breaks into David's house and discovers a shrine to Nicole in his bedroom. In a rage, Steven vandalizes the house, especially David's room. David and his friends make their way into Steven's house in revenge using scare tactics to gain access. David ties up Steven and brings him up to Nicole's room to \"say goodbye\" to his daughter. While David tells Nicole, \"It has to be this way,\" he asks her if she wants to go with him. She fakes affection for him and says \"yes.\" Laura frees Steven and he and David fight violently. Steven then throws David out the second-story window to his death.",

         "FEAR (1996) Rating: 8/10 While this movie had mixed opinions from critics, I thought it was thoroughly underrated. I didn't really see what this movie didn't have to please people around the globe. It had a story, and an intriguing one at that, it had a lot of genres to mix its story up in, it had well-developed characters \u0096 especially the character of the father \u0096 and it had excellent direction, acting and a great script that explores further into the world of terror. The film succeeds highly because of its characters and the original bunch they are. Reese Witherspoon plays the short-skirt wearing, blonde-haired and extremely family-bound and nice young girl that gets involved with a psychopath and doesn't know how to take it. Mark Wahlberg plays this psychopath excellently, his character is someone obsessed with Witherspoon's character and we will go to any great lengths to protect her and assure that his and her relationship is safe. And then he gets violent, very violent, and the outcome is horrifying. The father is not the most original character in the film, but the most developed. He is the caring, brave and extremely clever dad who wants the best for his daughter but doesn't want to hurt her. Anyway, enough about the characters. The rest of the movie rocks too \u0096 the script is surprisingly original for its premise, taking the boy-meets-girl, girl-dumps-boy, boy-gets-angry angle to new areas in psychological horror. The suspense scenes are incredibly tense and the movie has some gut-wrenchingly scary but incredibly good ideas. I really enjoyed the director's point of view and liked the way he built his film as each of the characters slowly drifts off. I appreciated this thriller a lot and think it is worth your time, but beware, you're in for a pretty darn scary and atmospheric ride!",
         "I had very low hopes for FEAR . I'd read the synopsis in the TV guide and the plot sounded like one of those psycho killer stalker from hell thrillers that were being churned out without any thought in the mid 1990s . Considering it starred singer Marky Mark , Reese Witherspoon and William Petersen who's a rival to Eric Roberts in the straight to video / cable TV movie stakes I didn't think this was going to be up to much While not being a classic thriller FEAR certainly did hold my attention , probably because much of the characterisation is credible . All too often in this genre the actor or actress playing the villain really goes to town showing the audience what a bad ass they are thereby parodying the role . Mark Wahlberg as David is very restrained for the most part which makes David and credible character and his on screen chemistry with Reese Witherspoon's Nicole is believable , you can believe these two characters are genuinely in love with one another something that is all too rare in this type of movie I should also point out that much of the movie revolves around the interaction of Petersen's Mr Walker who is concerned about his daughter's relationship with David . You can't blame the guy for wanting what's best for his offspring and it enhances the credibility of the story . It's refreshing to have a more thoughtful approach to this type of genre because if people start turning up dead after 15 minutes then things start to get silly , so the violence is kept to a minimum until almost at the end of the movie which does suffer something of a plot hole because no one seems to have a mobile telephone at readily hand and don't tell me professional people didn't have mobile phones in 1996 . Also watch out for references to STRAW DOGS , THE SHINING and NOSFERATU at the climax Even if you're burned out on those 90s stalker from hell thrillers you could do worse than watch this on a wet Friday evening",
         "The story behind the film \"Fear\" is nothing new. Obsessive love leading to dangerous fatal attraction. But I'm not ashamed to say that I really enjoyed watching this movie. To be sure, there were the typical cliches (did anyone not know that the security guard was SO dead!). However, the action in the film keeps things moving along at a steady pace, and the tension builds towards the reasonably satisfying climax. Performances by the lead characters were generally quite good. I found Mark Wahlbergs character to be quite convincing and quite menacing, though I agree he would certainly benefit from some speech coaching. The two young female leads, Reese Witherspoon and Alyssa Milano, did a good job playing the victims, and certainly add value to the film for their attractiveness alone. The standout performance for me was that of William L. Petersen as the father. Most of his actions/reactions rang true to me. Was \"Fear\" a great movie? Not really. Was it a good, satisfying and ultimately entertaining way to spend 97 minutes? Yes indeed. Even my wife stayed awake till the end, and that's worth an 8/10 alone.",
         "Movie like this either reach out and pull you in or they don't. Fear pulled me in. I rented this movie about a week after Halloween of 1996 and put it in my VCR not sure what to expect. 2 hours later I ejected the movie from the VCR feeling somewhat dazed and overwhelmed. Fear isn't a classic. But it works well. It is scary, violent gory and well made. The reason it works so well is because it was made by people who knew what they were doing. The whole stalker style of movies is full of uninspired trash that sounds like it was made for the USA network. Fear stands heads and shoulders above that (And to some extent above the original Fatal Attraction). It's not afraid to push, to pull us inside, to scare us and give us a good conclusion at the end, one that movies of this type always mess up. ***",
         "\"Fear\" is a teen thriller with no intentions others than entertain the audience and show good looking teen stars like Mark Wahlberg, Reese Whiterspoon, and the always lovely Alyssa Milano. This is not a good movie by any means but it has positive things to underline. First, Wahlberg and Whiterspoon can act and their performances are the best thing about the movie. Milano is a delight to watch even that she's not very required in the movie but still shines in the few minutes she appears. Second and best of all; \"Fear\" goes directly to the point and makes it very easy to watch. *SPOILERS* There's nothing much to comment about \"Fear\" except for some infamous scenes like the dog's head, the drilling in the hand, and the three sex scenes. There are some Slasher elements a la Scream in this movie that in the time were very effective (stabbing, dog's head cut off, minimal gore, and a psycho killer) and worked very well in order to create a tense atmosphere. The ending is quite predictable and expected. The actors they chose perform surprisingly good. If the plot is not very interesting then the least you can expect is to feel some sympathy for the characters. Whiterspoon is tender and beautiful and you totally believe her when she has different feelings for her boyfriend. Wahlberg delivers a good performance as a crazed angry boyfriend. Come on, everybody feels anger jealous acts... this is exactly where I think that \"Fear\" succeeds. The movie is directed to a teenager audience that immediately feels similarities in their personal life with the events of it. The movie works in that aspect and there's no question about it. Watch it with minimal expectations and you will be surprised maybe a little. 6/10",
         "**SPOILERS** Your usual psycho movie with a bit of a twist, like snapping one's neck, that has to do with this loved crazed teenager David McCall, Mark Wahlberg, who just can't let go of the object of his obsession pretty blond high school student Nicole Walker, Reese Witherspoon, whom he want's to be his \"woman\" even if it kills her! Meeting David through a mutual friend Margo Masse, Alyssa Milano, Nicole is completely captivated by the handsome and muscular young man's shyness and sincerity towards her. As we, and Nicole, soon find out David has a past that he wants people, especially Nicoles parents, not to not know anything about. Orphaned early in life David became an incorrigible youth that lead him from one broken home, in trying to get him adopted, to another. Now in his teens David has drifted into Seattle and started this gang of both drug dealing and drug partying thugs that Margo, Nicole' best friend, got involved with. David's true personality comes to the surface when he catches Nicole with her friend Gary, Todd Caldecott, outside of school kissing and almost beats the young man into a coma! Why this dangerous lunatic wasn't arrested and put away, with the criminal record he already had, shows how slow and ineffective the justice system really is. Worming his way into both Nicole's heart and home David starts to get to work on both her parents Steve and Laura Walker, William Petersen & Amy Brenneman, with his charm and and boyish innocence. It's Nicole's dad Steve who at first sees what a lowlife and dangerous rat, in his little boy lost and without love routine, David is and this results in him being the major target, when he goes wacko, of David's mindless violence. When Nicole goes to pay David a surprise visit she sees just exactly what he's really all about. Peeking inside David's pad, a drug den, Nicoel's sees David and his gang partying and shooting up with her friend, who looks like she's totally wiped out, Margo as the star attraction! It's when Steve after taking all the cr*p that David could dish out, on him and his family, goes to his gang's clubhouse drug den and sees among other outrages that he secretly, after having sex with her, stole his daughter's panties-to prove that he did it- that he finally loses his cool! Going berserk Steve wrecks the place together with all the drugs and drug paraphernalia thats there! It's after that when things, if they weren't already, really start to get out of hand in the movie. A mad as hell David, now seeking bloody revenge, and his gang get so carried away in their actions against the Walkers that they not only break into their well fortified home and but even go so far as to murder, if that's the word for it, the family pet and guard dog Kaiser by decapitating him! The final few minutes in the movie-with his gang members by then either killed or put to flight- has the by now totally deranged David go after, after almost beating him to death, Steve as his \"love\" Nicoel stands helplessly by in not being able to do anything to save of father from getting is brains blown out! It's that fear on Nicoel's part that has her do what she should have done much earlier in the movie! Stick it to her deranged psycho lover and stick it where it hurts most!",
         "Nice, innocent teen Nicole (Reese Witherspoon) falls for handsome, muscular, soft spoken David (Mark Wahlberg) not knowing he's a psycho who wants her--forever. Good thing she's got a nice, muscular, protective father (William Petersen). OK, it's no masterpiece and the plot is very familiar, but I was never bored. It's well-directed (especially a roller coaster ride), has beautiful scenery and architecture (look at the house where Witherspoon lives with her family) and a script that, if not always credible, never stops moving. The last 20 minutes really rock. A little unpleasant at times though. As for the acting--Witherspoon is OK. At times, she's totally believable--other times she's not. And she's obviously over 17. Petersen is very good playing the understanding, protective dad. A nice, understated performance. Mark Wahlberg is (surprisingly) very good as the psycho. He plays the nice guy and the evil guy very effectively. REALLY nice bod too--what a chest! But he needs some serious voice lessons--his Boston accent kept creeping in. So, a pretty good thriller. You could do worse.",
         "Over the years I've caught bits and pieces of this film many times on cable and even premium movie channels. Just finally I decided to sit down and watch it all and I must say overall \"Fear\" is a pretty decent mind thriller. It's theme fits well with teenage love obsession and the stalker crisis. And the cast here is well known it features some of the early work for most of them before they would go on to TV fame(Brenneman, Milano, and Petersen) and movie stardom(Wahlberg and Witherspoon). Set in Seattle, Washington a teenage girl the innocent and pretty Nicole(in one of Reese's earliest roles)lives with her father Steve(William Petersen)and stepmother Laura(Amy Brenneman)and Nicole has a good loving family life yet her parents are to overprotective and she starts to give into the pressure of her peers especially from her best friend the free spirited and sleazy Margo(the hot Alyssa Milano). It's upon their partying and club going that Nicole meets a young and innocent and nice talking young man named David(Mark Wahlberg). Yet appearances and personalities can be deceiving as after David seduces Nicole and she loses her innocence and develops a false trust surely enough David begins a violent obsession with her. Her family sees it and warns her, eventually this leads to drama all concluding with violence and a hostage situation with Nicole's family that was brought on by David and his thug friends. Yet in the end Nicole will grow to learn love is blind as she faces her fear. Pretty decent thriller of the stalker mode with some early performances from what would later be big stars in both TV and film. So give it a watch some late night on cable or premium TV.",
         "The sixteen year-old teenager Nicole Walker (Reese Witherspoon) has moved to the house by the lake of her father, the architect Steve Walker (William Petersen), to live with her stepmother Laura (Amy Brenneman) and her brother Toby (Christopher Gray). Her best friends are Margo Masse (Alyssa Milano) and Gary Rohmer (Todd Caldecott) that study with her in the high school. When Nicole meets David McCall (Mark Wahlberg) in a night-club, she has a crush on and dates him. David becomes obsessed by Nicole and one day he sees her friend Gary kissing and hugging her and he hits him. Nicole breaks with him but David continues to follow her. Steve decides to investigate the young man and he finds that he is an orphan that has spent most of his life in reformatories. The hell breaks loose in Nicole's life when David kills Gary and trashes the Mustang of her father. Steve breaks in his house and destroys everything inside. Now David and his gang go to Steve's house to payback. \"Fear\" is a good movie, with great story and performances. I saw this movie for the first time in the late 90's on VHS and last Friday I saw it again on DVD, and the plot seems to be more realistic in the present days of violence and fear in many worldwide cities. This is also a great opportunity to see Reese Witherspoon very young and cute, and Mark Wahlberg perfect performing a manipulative psychopath. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): \"Medo\" (\"Fear\")",
         "\"Fear\" is a slightly-above average thriller at best, boasting fine performances from Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon and William Petersen. Nicole Walker is sixteen years-old and living with her businessman father and step-mother and brother in a luxurious, well fortified and secure pad. When reluctantly skipping school one day with her rebellious friends, she spots the hunk David McCall (Mark Wahlberg) - wearing a tight black sweater to accentuate them pecs, of course, playing pool with his misfit, drug-addled pals. She later meets him at a rave, and before long, they are dating. David is perfect, it seems. He's strong, caring, sweet and gentle, and Nicole falls in love with him. But it isn't long before David's true colours start to show. And when she ends it with him, he begins to stalk her before eventually, he gets nasty... \"Fear\" runs smoothly at a nice pace over a very agreeable run-time. Mark Wahlberg is superb as a psychopath, while Reese Witherspoon is believable as a naive and innocent sixteen year-old girl (Considering she was 20 at the time). William Petersen, best known for his career with \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\", is commendable as he gives Dustin Hoffman's heroics in \"Straw Dogs\" a run for it's money at the end. Overall, this is a decent thriller, albeit nothing special really. It's pretty tense in parts, but Wahlberg's performance was really key to this films success."
