         "Characters that exist beyond their relationship and don't need desperately to get laid nor someone to complete themselves, very interesting design and transitions between chapters, with well placed metaphors. This are, for me, the great technical features of the anime - even though the story isn't that unique, it doesn't make the experience of watching it less better.",
         "This is one of the best Shounen Ai movie I have ever watched (and probably my first ever review on IMDb). I am a Living Fujoshi and I have watched/Read many ShounenAi/BL/YAOI Anime and Manga. But this one stands out the most. This is a story of how two high school boys innocently fall in love with each other. The movie covers only the first volume of the series, but it is enough to appease my fujoshi heart (left 3 chapters that are irrelevant, anyway). This Movie got me grinning from ear to ear the whole time. I encourage you to read the manga as well. There is Part/Volume 1 up to Chapter 9 and Part/Volume 2 up to chapter 12.",
         "It's a short, 1 hour experience that takes you through two boys' relationship over a year or two. It's really sweet, the characters are simple but relatable and It's really satisfying to watch. For being only an hour, It got it's point across. It's a sweet, simple slice of life. I think the writers really did a great job with this one. The art style is also something very different from what we normally see nowadays. It's simpler and fits the tone. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",
         "I really thought this anime was super super cute with a nerdy shy guy who wants to get ahead with his education Sajo and the bad boy rocker Kusakabe. I mean seriously whenever they both embrace each other, my heart stops and I cant breathe, my inner fangirl was shook lol! Seriously though, this movie just really was wonderful and gives you a good kick outta life no matter how hard it can be! I think both guys were just made for each other, although some scenes I found cringy when the learning support teacher(cant remeber the name) badly wanted to kiss Sajo. Jeez if he was doing that for real, that teacher would lose his job and it wouldn't be a nice punishment either! It was even strange that after Kusakabe thumped him, he became friends with him later on, like really? I would keep away from that creep who is meant to be a teacher, not a love advisor! Anyways I'm glad both Sajo and Kusakabe lived happily ever after! I give this a 9/10 because it was just a sweet gay story!"
