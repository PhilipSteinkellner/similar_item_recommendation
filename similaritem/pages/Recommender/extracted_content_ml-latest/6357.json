      "synopsis": "High Society (1956) is a musical remake of The Philadelphia Story; a film starring Kathryn Hepburn as the bride, Cary Grant as the first husband, and Jimmy Stuart and Ruth Hussey as the reporters. A spoiled heiress, daughter of divorce, is arranging her second marriage when things are upset by the arrival of several unwelcome and uninvited guests including her father, her first husband and a pair of reporters from a scandal sheet. This slender plot gains nothing by a move to Newport, Rhode Island, and sinks like a stone under the addition of color, music and Louis Armstrong. Frank Sinatra and Celeste Holm are good as the reporters, but the rest of the cast is a poor imitation of the original. Bing Crosby never had the looks or the class of Cary Grant, and Grace Kellys petulant imitation of Kathryn Hepburn is just pitiful. Look for the original.",

         "MGM was pretty lucky to secure the talents of Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Grace Kelly, Celeste Holm, and Louis Armstrong to get involved in this great musical adaption of The Philadelphia Story. Cole Porter contributed a great original score for this film with songs very specifically written to suit the talents of High Society's players. I do wish Celeste Holm had been given more to do than just the duet with Frank Sinatra, Who Wants To Be a Millionaire. On Broadway Celeste Holm was a musical star with Oklahoma and Bloomer Girl to her credit, but MGM didn't want to recognize that. For this film, the story is reset from Philadelphia to Newport, Rhode Island to bring in the famous Jazz Festival. Philip Barry's social commentary is toned down and a very partisan Greek Chorus is added in the person of Mr. Louis \"Satchmo\" Armstrong. Satchmo tells you right up front who he's pulling for to win Grace Kelly and he helps musically along the way. Satch and Bing have that classic Now You Has Jazz duet, so successful was it that they did an album together a few years later. Bing Crosby during his life was crazy about jazz musicians and there was no one he liked better than Louis Armstrong. No one on the planet could resist that man's joy for living. Grace Kelly got a chance to bat 1000 in the recording industry. She was no singer as she would have freely admitted, but Cole Porter wrote True Love specifically to accommodate her limited range and when she does the last two bars of True Love with Der Bingle she got a million selling record for her one and only platter. As for Bing he got his 20th Gold record and the only one not with Decca records. True Love was nominated for Best Song at the Oscars but lost to Doris Day's Que Sera Sera which boomed all over the charts in 1956. It was sadly Cole Porter's last opportunity to win an Oscar for one of his movie songs. Frank Sinatra got a couple of good ballads in You're Sensational and Mind If I Make Love to You, but what he's best remembered for is that classic Well Did You Evah duet with Bing. Today's fans can't possibly appreciate the screen meeting of the two best and best known singers for the previous generations. A musical summit conference. High Society's tone is a lot lighter than the Philadelphia Story. The cast in terms of acting ability are not in the same league as Grant, Stewart, Hepburn, and Hussey. But folks it is a musical. I doubt those stars could have carried off the Cole Porter score. You can't miss with a cast like this, in either film for that matter.",
         "I have a theory about \"High Society\" and that is that you must regard it as an Opera. Now I haven't lost my marbles and I am not suggesting that Cole Porter is Verdi. What I mean is that the story is so preposterous (as are most Opera plots) that it is best not to question it too closely and just enjoy the movie. Porter's music is sensational (to coin a phrase) and the songs are all well performed. Grace Kelly's rendition of \"True Love\" (yes, it is her - not dubbed) is delicious and just adds to her allure. Isn't it wonderful just how sexy Ms Kelly is in this film? This is 1956 and there is no flashing of bosom or even leg � just her natural beauty. She spends some time in the bedroom with Frank Sinatra and (improbably) remains chaste. Frank the honourable man! I watched \"The Philadelphia Story\" again recently and was surprised how much of the script from that movie was retained for \"High Society\". If you find the story of High Society silly (it is) then it is really the earlier film you should blame. The set piece musical numbers in High Society are absolute classics � indeed there isn't a dud. It's worth listing them and you'll see what I mean: \"High Society Calypso\";\" Little One\";\" Who Wants to be a Millionaire ?\";\"True Love\";\" I Love You Samantha\";\" Well, Did You Evah\"; \"Mind If I Make Love To You\";\" Now You Has Jazz\";\" You're Sensational\". WOW! When you go to the Opera you want great music, good performances, lovely sets and some sort of feel good factor. With \"High Society\" you get all this and more. It is played tongue in cheek (how could it not be?) and that is how it should be. Keep your \"Film noir\" or your \"Cinema Vérité\" � give me High Society every time!",
         "A society wedding is being arranged in Newport, Rhode Island. The beautiful Tracy Lord is to marry George Kitteredge. However, Tracy's ex-husband, the songwriter Dexter Haven, has never stopped loving her and even now has hopes of winning her back. Two journalists, Mike Connor and Liz Imbrie, have arrived to cover the story for 'Spy' Magazine. Dexter has scheduled the Newport Jazz Festival for the same week as the nuptials, and this brings Louis Armstrong (playing himself) to town. The divine Tracy is adored by three men - Dexter, George and Mike Connor. She begins to harbour doubts about her forthcoming marriage... \"High Society\" is a charming reworking of \"The Philadelphia Story\", the Grant-Hepburn comedy, which was in turn a remodelling of a successful Broadway play. The one great difference with this version is that \"High Society\" is a glorious musical masterpiece. Cole Porter's score has to be one of the greatest collections of songs ever filmed. Grace Kelly is good as the imperious Tracy. \"I'm a cold goddess,\" she intones, but she thaws spectacularly in the warmth of love. Bing Crosby as Dexter is his usual droll and stylish self. Crosby is a class act who holds the screen with effortless poise and cracks the funnies with sparkling sarcasm. Sinatra is in knockout form. Rarely has that legendary voice achieved the resonant timbre on display here. Satchmo blasts out a couple of breezy jazz numbers, and comments on the action like a latter-day Greek chorus. The songs include five all-time classics. \"True Love\" is a gorgeous duet in which Kelly unveils a tuneful if brittle singing-voice. \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?\" is rightly world-famous, and is staged here with clever clownage by Sinatra and Celeste Holm (playing Liz). Satchmo's band accompanies Crosby in a swinging \"You Has Jazz\". The showstopper, \"What A Swell Party This Is\", has Crosby and Sinatra at their very best, wisecracking self-referentially as they belt out a gem of a song. My personal favourite, \"You're Sensational\", is beautifully rendered by Sinatra. Watch Frank and Grace in the instrumental break, falling in love with their eyes only. A confection of sublime music and snappy dialogue, \"High Society\" is shot in bright, eye-catching Technicolor with an attractive pastel blue predominating throughout. A delightful film.",
         "\"High Society\" unites the unbeatable talents of three legendary stars Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Louis Armstrong with the beautiful and talented Grace Kelly in her final role before she becomes the loving Princess of Monaco� Spoiled Tracy (Kelly) is about to marry a boring businessman John Lund, but on the eve of her nuptials, her ex-husband Crosby, who still calls her Sam, returns to try and put a stop to the wedding� On hand to cover her upcoming nuptials for a spy magazine are journalists Celeste Holm) and Sinatra, with the greatest American jazz musician Louis Armstrong providing with Crosby a musical jazz called \"Now You Has Jazz.\" Armstrong opens the film from the back of the blue bus shared with his band, with a calypso song, while the classic \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" is lively sung by Sinatra and Holm alone in a big room filled with Kelly's many extravagant wedding gifts� Kelly is lovely as the refined woman flirting with three men� In scenes that required the softening of her unyielding nature, she seems so reserved and cold in manner� Sinatra sings to her \"You're Sensational\" and \"Mind if I Make Love to You? Crosby sings \"True Love.\"",
         "High Society is a terrific film. If you are the type of movie fan who doesn't comprehend the ENTERTAIN part of entertainment and is eager and willing to flaunt that ignorance in film reviews, you will hate it. But if you don't mind it when movies may not end up with deep psychological messages or everybody dead or doomed to a life of misery, you'll agree. I'm the first to admit that this musical may not be DRAMATICALLY up to standard with The Philadelpia Story, but what musical could be, or should be, for that matter. The cast, however, is another thing entirely. As you probably know, the first cast was nearly incomparable. Suave and tremendously charming Cary Grant, the magnificent Katherine Hepburn, and, of course, Jimmy, who won an Oscar for his work and is never less than adorable. NEARLY incomparable.But if anyone can do it, it's gotta be Bing,Satchmo,Gracie,and the Voice. I find it hard to believe anyone in the world could possibly contest that, but since there are such unlikely specimens out there, I'd better explain. If there's a more magnificent marriage than that of Frank Sinatra and a Cole Porter masterpiece, I'd like to hear about it. But even perfection can be improved, when you add Bing Crosby, a witty little tune,and some hilarious ad libs, all courtesy of a few too many drinks.That makes up heaven, which can also go under the heading of '' Well, Did you Evah,'' without a doubt the best song ,and scene, in this film. But never fear, there are other gems as well. Grace Kelly is terrific in High Society. The not quite yet Princess of Monaco is not only breathtakingly beautiful, but adorable as well. Her drunken warbling of ''You're Sensational,'' as her stiffly embarrassed fiancé drags her through a crowd of very proper guests is hilarious, and I can never keep from laughing during the scene when she meets Mike Connor and Liz Embrie, also known as Frank Sinatra and Celeste Holm. Louis Armstrong doesn't have much to do in the picture, but what he does do is great. He introduces the film with a cute calypso number, sings a marvelous duet with Bing, and the way he say's,'' End of song, beginin' of the storyyy,'' is enough to make him unforgettable. Bing, of course, can NEVER be anything but magnificent. He remains an American icon, and all his talent, charm, and timeless quality are well displayed.He makes his easy-going way through some magical songs,too, including, two marvelous duets with his singing co-stars, and, of course, that little #1 record he did with Grace. Personally, I like Celeste Holm even more in High Society than I liked Ruth Hussey,who played the Liz Embrie role in Philadelphia Story.She's funny, charming,works well with Sinatra, sings a hilarious duet with The Voice, and has a beautiful smile. ( Not that the last thing mentioned matters, but it helps.) And now-the best for last. I have been a Sinatra adorer for years, so I'm more than a little biased, but I absolutely love Mr.Sinatra in this movie. His singing is flawless and incomparable, ( especially in ''You're Sensational,'') his charm and charisma even more evident than the considerable amount displayed by Mr.Crosby, and he's pure style and ring-a-ding ding.( Those blue eyes ain't bad either!) Oh, one complaint I've found about High Society is that it's outdated and it aged badly. I am 14 years old, so, if there WERE any reason to believe that, I'd be one of the first to know it. It is NOT outdated, has NOT aged badly, and it's one of the most entertaining and simply fun movies I've ever seen. And that is, as Satchmo says, the...'' End of storyyy!!''",
         "Something wrong happened as MGM tried to update the much more original \"The Philadelphia Story\". Some of the blame should go to the uninspired direction of Walter Charles, who can't overcome what the great George Cukor achieved in the original movie version. Part of the blame is shared with John Patrick's screen play that might have been based on the Philip Barry play, but what one sees on the screen is a dull attempt of movie making. Donald Ogden Stewart, who adapted the original play gave that film a light and fun touch, which in Mr. Cukor's hands and brilliant direction came alive throughout the picture. It's not fair to make comparisons, but unfortunately, the creators of \"High Society\" leave themselves wide open for it. Right off the start, these stars can't compare with the magnificent performances by Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant, James Stewart, Ruth Hussey and the irresistible Virginia Weidler. Grace Kelly was an elegant actress who as Tracy Lord gives the role another interpretation but doesn't capture the spirit of the no-nonsense socialite she is supposed to be. Bing Crosby, as Dexter, has some good moments, especially in the \"True Love\" segment in the yacht with Tracy. Frank Sinatra's Mike Connors is all right, although we can't just imagine how he can be in love with Liz Imbrie. Celeste Holm who appears as Liz gave a tamed reading of her character. The best thing in the film is the prologue and the finale with the incomparable Louis Armstrong, whose presence would have been used to put some sparkle in this subdued version of Philip Barry's wonderful play.",
         "Fifty years later, this movie still remains only notorious due to its musical aspects more than its often wooden acting and lines mouthed verbatim from an (uncredited) Philip Barry. When the original feature was made in 1940, it was a gamble to bring Katharine Hepburn's all but dead career back into the spotlight one last time -- if it failed she would stay in Broadway. The story is well-known: Barry had written a play, \"The Philadelphia Story,\" expressly for Hepburn and her part, that of the socialite Tracy Samantha Lord, reflected Hepburn's arrogant position against Hollywood at the time. It was fitting to make into a movie and see if the results would garner the desired effect, and it comes to no surprise that it did, with Hepburn revitalizing what has come to be believed as one of the greatest film careers of all time. Then MGM decided to do a musical version -- the only way to do so, since Hepburn own the rights to the play -- and retitled it \"High Society,\" removing Philip Barry from the credits but not his text. They got the best of the talent that was available in the 50s, cast them in the roles made instantly classic by the actors of the previous movie, and watered down priceless dialogue, not only with padding here and there, but with the completely uninvolved acting. Kelly, in her last film, walked off into Monaco with a career that was apt, but not remarkable -- more known for perfect diction and beauty than actual personification. Holm is better here, but not as good -- she would never equate the spark she had in \"All About Eve.\" She also looks oddly aged, a good ten years older than her thirty-seven years. Crosby and Sinatra are good, but not memorable -- certainly not Grant and Stewart, both oozing chemistry with Hepburn and with each other. The other actors do their parts; however, not a single one warrant mention -- not the case of young Virginia Weidler who walked off with the movie playing a small part as Tracy's kid sister in the original version. This is -- though now seen as a classic, it's overrated -- what's been come to be seen as a poor man's version of a much wittier, sharper story. Good, but nothing more.",
         "I was extremely disappointed with this movie. I only made it about 30 minutes before giving up. The songs may be good, but not if you have to watch this movie to hear them. This movie has none of the spark of Philadelphia Story. The cast may have excelled in other arenas, but they seem miscast here and they seem to know it. Everyone is just going through the motions. It's a drab, tedious, dull movie.",
         "Tracy Lord is a society woman with an inflexible sense of propriety: not only has she divorced her socially liberal first husband C.K. Dexter-Haven, she has forced her mother to separate from her father over the latter's questionable behavior with a chorus girl. Now she plans to marry George Kittredge, a social climber with a sense of propriety as inflexible as her own--only to find her wedding suddenly beset by her first husband, two pesky reporters, the possibility of a paternal scandal, and a local jazz fest. If all this sounds a bit familiar, it should be no surprise. Originally written for the stage by Philip Barry under the title THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, it proved a smash hit during the 1940s on both stage and screen, and this remake follows the original very closely, only fiddling with the story and characters to the extent of introducing and rationalizing Cole Porter's musical elements. The original non-musical film cast included Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and James Stewart--a hard act to follow, to say the least. But while they don't best that teaming, stars Grace Kelly (Tracy), Bing Crosby (C.K. Dexter-Haven), and Frank Sinatra (Mike Connor, one of the reporters) carry off the roles with considerable charm. But the real strength of this film is the guest appearance of Louis Armstrong and the Cole Porter score. Only Porter would be brazen enough to write lyrics that rhyme Circe with Mercy, and while this is one of his lesser efforts it is still pretty impressive stuff, including such memorable tunes as \"True Love,\" the satirical \"Well, Did You Ever?,\" and such throw-away charmers as \"Little One.\" As for Louis Armstrong, his star quality is powerful enough to put even Sinatra in the shade. The failure of the film is the fact that every one in the cast seems to play a bit too casually, and although they are all clearly having a good time they never really achieve the sparkle a truly great musical comedy requires. Even so, musical fans--particularly those of Cole Porter, Armstrong, Crosby, and Sinatra--will find it quite enjoyable, and Grace Kelly fans will find the actress as lovely as ever. Recommended.

         "This second rendition of the exuberant play by John Barry, while inferior to Cukor's 1940 version, remains a delightful farce on the upper class thanks to the witty, sparkling script from the play by John Barry. The cast is commendable albeit not spectacular given , showcasing the drollery of the script. Grace Kelly (in her last complete screen performance) surprises us with her comedic talents helped along by the script; Crosby slips into the comfortable role of the guy-next-door that is all too familiar with his screen person. Sinatra (showing some of his age) sings adequately, but seems a little distant and lacks the edge, danger and sexiness of his 1940 counterpart. I might only add that the 3 principals seemed to lack that spark which validated their freewheeling around L.A singing songs about making love. On screen I did not feel they were as youthful and vibrant as seen in some of their earlier films. The direction by Charles Walters - an accomplished director of film musicals including Gigi, Ziegfeld Follies, and Annie get your Gun - supports the cast very well with various long shots of the mansion and sunny California. He is splendidly able to infuse the house with it's sparkling jewels and ornaments with a sense of grandeur, merriment and delight so that it fully inhabits the characters and their kingdom. The scene-stealer each time is Louis Armstrong and his band. While his interludes are not his best pieces to showcase, the music is pleasant, dreamy and fun. What else would you expect from this rollicking comedy? And how can you not love Armstrong? He was so adorable! It was interesting to note the audience's reaction to this film. Musicals are one of my favourite genres - I love them for the swooning and swinging numbers - however the audience did not appreciate it so much. There were even groans and boos (which I found disrespectful - you must know it's a musical!) when Sinatra and Kelly burst into dreamy love duets. I have to admit though that the transition of the songs in the film was not altogether seamless (even choppy at times). At times it seemed like a selling point for the producers to capitalise on the musical craze sweeping the country during that period in Hollywood (See Kelly and Sinatra sing!); add name dropping, and songs & lyrics that misrepresent Cole Porter's skill and wit as a composer. This is a fun film however deeply overshadowed by the original 1940 version and lacking Cuckor's razor-sharp screwball slapstick. The pace is also slower however it probably compensates for delighting us with the elegant sets and musical interludes. I was also fortunate to see this film with audience and definitely relished hearing the viewers chortle along to the absurd story and zany characters. It was impossible not to join in the belly-laughs in this dreamy ride."
