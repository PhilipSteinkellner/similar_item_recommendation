Style is neither real, nor surreal, maybe a little bit of both, probably trying to achieve to be one of those so called absurd comedy movie. Throughout the movie, people keep killing their lovers for stupid reasons, but never for jealousy, or passion or any apparent motive. The movie feels like a replication of Leyla and Mecnun, a TV series by the same director, but with more obnoxious characters, and it barely rises above an episode of a TV series in terms of originality and story telling. Characters do not appear to be sincere or believable, most of the time they look theatrical and cartoonish and they constantly try to be funny or witty, in my opinion, makes them way more obnoxious. Currently, the movie has way higher rating than it deserves, probably because Turkish viewers have tendency of giving higher ratings for Turkish movies."],
