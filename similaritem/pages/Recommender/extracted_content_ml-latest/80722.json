         "I was lucky enough to see this movie in London last year. I may have forgotten some of the details since then but I do remember what a great movie this was. The story revolves around a group of \"Lads\". The \"leader\" of this group of twenty somethings starts to head away the group's usual juvenile direction and head into career and marriage pursuits. The Best Man decides to create a video of the friends as a wedding present. In reality the video is supposed to help bring the leader back into the fold. Great acting and production by names I'd not heard of before(excepting \"Ali G\") and a really funny, mature script all lead to a very enjoyable hour and a half. Why is it not on general release yet?!",
         "When I first saw this on the shelf at the video store I thought they were taking advantage of the success of Borat and they clearly are, but...why not. You gotta do what you gotta do to get your film seen, even if it's nearly a decade old. That said, the packaging is very cheap and I figured it'd be a real schlock piece of work. Boy was I wrong. I laughed my *ss off. The movie stands on it's own. Not a dull moment. Sacha Baron Cohen has a good recurring role in the thing but he's not one of the leads. This is very \"Stooge-esk\" in a more sophisticated way and I would highly recommend it for big belly laughs and loud guffaws."

But one day, Spider, the group's de facto leader, announces he's decided to marry his girlfriend Annie -- and what's more, he's even vying for a promotion at work. Des, his best friend, agrees to be his best man; he even gets a camcorder so he can make a video about the club's exploits before matrimony lures Spider away. But then Vinnie decides to follow Spider's example, proposing to his girlfriend Tina, and Des starts wondering if he's documenting Spider's last days of bachelorhood or the beginning of the end of the Jolly Boys."],
