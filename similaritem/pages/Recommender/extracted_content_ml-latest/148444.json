         "After the children's book \"Emil und die Detektive\" was published in 1928 this first screen version was made in 1931 under the supervision of the author Erich Kästner himself. The story seems simple: young Emil gets to visit his granny in Berlin and is given 140 marks by his mother for his grandma. On the train to Berlin the 140 marks are stolen by a man with a stiff hat while Emil sleeps. Arriving in Berlin he tries to follow the thief and receives help from a well organized and nice \"gang\" of Berlin street \"detectives\" in his age. A happy end seems possible. While the movie contains a very entertaining story itself, an even more interesting detail of this movie is in its backdrop: an authentic Berlin of 1931 with open cabs, cars driving next to coaches, wide streets with lots of space for cyclists and so on. I always wondered when viewing older city maps what street life was like in the twenties of the last century when the streets were not as crowded as today, when the speed difference between pedestrians, cyclists, cars and coaches was still comparable in human measures. The camera work, special effects (Emils dream on the train) and movie music are distinctly thirty-ish which made this movie even more interesting to me. All in all a very enjoyable movie for kids and adults alike.",
         "Given that 1931 was year 2 of sound movies in Germany, the handling of sound is quite decent in this nice old piece, the first in a series of films made after the classic children's novel. Billie Wilder did not direct, but wrote the script, and probably drew from his experiences with Menschen am Sonntag the year before, which also had many scenes of Berlin street traffic. This little old gem, which in the hotel sequence has some proto-noir-ish style, was remarketed on DVD by Universum/Atlas in 2003, in a double-feature with the 1954 version (which I'm going to see next - if only for the fun of comparing Berlin streetscapes...) Very lovely, highly recommended.",
         "I was 10 years old when the 1964 version of Emil and the Detectives came out. I loved that movie. I even had a recording of the soundtrack that I played over and over again when I was alone. Then, just last night, I happened to catch an interview with Billy Wilder on television. It mentioned his early work on an \"Emil and the Detectives\". Today I sit astounded that there is not just one other earlier version of the film, but three earlier adaptations and one newer one (that I have found out about). I like to think that I am a minor film buff, but this discovery that this film exists goes to show that the vast treasure of film worldwide is to be saved and cherished. I can hardly wait in the coming years to try and see all of the versions and compare the great and heartwarming story.",
         "...which isn't a wonder since this movie was directed by billy wilder. compared with the newest clone of this from 2001, it is quite simple to see, that one very important point for understanding the story is that it takes place in the 1920s/1930s when the story was written. the 2001 version takes place now, which makes it boring. it just looks like a copy. so go and get a hand at this masterpiece.",
         "\"Emil und die Detektive\" is a German black-and-white sound film from the year 1931, so to put it in perspective this fairly short movie, only 70 minutes, has its 85th anniversary this year and it was released even two years before the Nais came into power. Very very old film. The writer is Erich Kästner, who is still a legend in Germany today and he was not only alive when this movie was made, but was fairly young and worked on the script as well. I also see Billy Wilder here, so there worked some really famous people on this film. Director Gerhard Lamprecht is certainly not as famous as the other two, but he was a successful filmmaker in his own right too. Also I cannot say I am familiar with anybody of the actors in here, but that should not be too big of a surprise as the majority were child actors. At times, this film felt like a German version of the Rascal gang that was extremely popular in the United States at the same time, only that the kids in this German film here were older of course. Talking about the film itself, I must say that I have not read Kästner's book, so I cannot say how much they changed compared to the original literary work. I thought there were some good moments in this film. But unfortunately, it simply was not enough, not even for such a short film. The train scene early on was good and I also felt the actor who played the main antagonist Grundeis did a solid job, but the kids all felt interchangeable and were not memorable at all and this also includes title character Emil. He was played by Rolf Wenkhaus, an actor who also died less than 10 years later while executing Hitler's despicable orders. But back to the film. I myself found it fairly mediocre and it did not really get me involved at all. I see there are more versions out there from recent years and I cannot say this really old film did get me interested a lot in checking these out. But still, I maybe will at some point. And I hope they deliver more convincingly than this 1931 movie. Not recommended."
