         "A chance encounter in a coffee shop between two people, both of whom are seeking their own identities (one literally, one figuratively), leads to a relationship seemingly beneficial to both, but for different reasons, in `Amateur,' written and directed by Hal Hartley. A man (Martin Donovan) wakes up one morning lying on his back in a quiet, out-of-the-way street in New York City; all he knows is that he's bleeding from the back of his head and is suffering from total amnesia. He has no identification on him; he has no idea who he is or how he came to be on that street. Dazed, he stumbles into a small coffee shop and sits down at the counter. He tries to order something, but the only money he has is Dutch, and he has no idea why. A young woman, also sitting at the counter and working on a lap-top computer, observes his plight and notices the blood on the back of his neck. Her name is Isabelle (Isabelle Huppert); asking for some water, she cleans his injury and buys him something to eat. Isabelle, it turns out, is a former nun, having only recently left the convent after fifteen years. Rather lost herself, she is attempting to make a living by writing pornographic stories for a magazine. A self-professed nymphomaniac (though she is still a virgin), she also feels that she has a specific purpose in life, a destiny she has yet to fulfill, though she has yet to figure out what it is. But she believes that meeting this man is a sign; perhaps he's a part of whatever it is she has to do. So she decides to help him, which just may lead her to the answers she is seeking about her own life, as well. As with all of Hartley's films, this one has a somewhat mesmerizing effect, which he exacts with a unique style of presenting his story that has to do with the look and feel of the film, the deliberate pace he establishes, and most especially the manner in which his actors deliver their lines. His performers speak with a rather stoic, matter-of-fact, understated rhythm that is engrossing in itself, very similar to the kind of cadence David Mamet employs in his films. But Hartley's method is even more pronounced, so that when one of his characters does have an emotional outburst, the underplaying that surrounds it significantly underscores the impact of it all. Few directors have such a unique style that so vividly identifies their work; Mamet is one, Ingmar Bergman another (the three of them being part of a very select group). And though this particular film is not, perhaps, one of Hartley's best, it is still pure Hartley, with aspects that are certainly engaging and memorable, beginning with his main character, Isabelle. Talk about an off-the-wall character! And yet, within the context of the story, she comes across as quite real and believable, which says something about Huppert's ability as an actress, as well as Hartley's expertise as a director. Huppert gives a very credible performance here, convincingly conveying that sense of confusion Isabelle obviously harbors deep within about her own life and where she's headed. She makes you realize that beyond anything else that's happening, this is essentially a person searching for a place to fit in, which is why she makes such a connection with this stranger, this man who really has no idea of who he is or where he belongs. And Huppert certainly makes Isabelle someone with whom it is easy to empathize. Donovan, a veteran of many of Hartley's films, is very effective here also, with a very pensive, understated performance that clearly indicates an honest sense of this man's bewilderment, as does the very real caution with which he approaches his situation as he attempts to reorient himself and get on with his life. And Hartley develops the relationship between Isabelle and this man in real time-- there's no instant love affair here, as happens so often in cinematic renderings of similar situations-- which gives a ring of authenticity to the story, bizarre as it may get. The supporting cast includes Elina Lowensohn (Sofia), Damian Young (Edward), Chuck Montgomery (Jan), Dave Simonds (Kurt) and Pamela Stewart (Officer Melville). No one can capture a sense of disenfranchisement any better than Hartley, as the characters in `Amateur' so aptly illustrate; these are people perpetually on the outside looking in, and yet there's something about them with which you will be able to relate, as well as sympathize . And that's part of Hartley's magic; making you realize, that in the end we're not so different from one another, after all. I rate this one 7/10.",
         "Hal Hartley's \"Amateur\" is an engagingly offbeat take on the \"crime thriller\" genre. It is also perhaps the most quietly thoughtful handling of amnesia (not as a plot trick, but as a subject) you're ever likely to see. But be warned: Hartley's refreshingly non-mainstream, detached, minimalist style takes quite some getting used to, and the ending is needlessly downbeat. (**1/2)",
         "Just stumbled across this movie on STARZ CINEMA. Never hear of it, the director (who apparently has a following) or most of the actors. But I remembered Isabelle Huppert from \"Bedroom Window\" years ago, and she was worth a look. What a piece of work! The most inspired, goofy film noir dialogue you will ever hear spoken, by deadpanned actors that somehow still grow on you. The missing person police officer who is heartbroken with every case. The virgin nymphomaniac, when asked how that combination can exist, says \"I'm Choosy!\" Since she's an ex-nun, I suppose that's true. The former porn star (what a sultry look!!) who wants to become a \"mover and a shaker\". Priceless stuff. This is also a very gentle R, with almost no profanity or nudity, in its sex crazed, porn sort of way. Many other IMDb people have given plot points, and either love or hate the presentation, but anyone who was not flat out hysterical when the \"hitman\" got shot, should stick to TV sitcoms. It was a pure Monty Python worthy moment!!",
         "Its been a while since I've this movie but its always stayed with me and I would strongly recommend it. This film has Hal Hartley's trademark sparse, artsy atmosphere, with the slightly surreal characters, the staged dialogue and set pieces. All the characters are quirky and memorable, I loved Isabelle Huppert's character - the nymphomanical nun - in particular and the story dissects amnesia in a really interesting way. Above all the central love story will draw you in more than you realise; the ending was both crushing and fitting. This is due to the acting, as every movement and expression helps to build characters and relationships. Isabelle Huppert and Martin Donovan both do this perfectly, and the impact of the ending owes a lot to them. The odd 'staging' of the film may put off those expecting a more conventional thriller but open minded viewers will be rewarded.",
         "Hal Hartley where have you been all my movie-loving life? This was the sort of movie-watching experience which required my calling my best friend and telling her about it, as I would any noteworthy experience. Yes, the ending was dismal... yet perfect! So much about redemption: This was clear if one remembers Thomas's feet at the beginning of the movie, and then Thomas's feet at the end. At that point, I saw the (one of) point to the story. I enjoyed the clipped dialogue, the clarity, AND the ironic absurdity. The story was not meant to be reality-driven, but limited to the raison d'etre of Thomas and the other characters: as in a dream, but not. Discovering it was a marvelous channel-surfing accident. Now I must do a search on Hal Hartley. Check out his portfolio, so to speak. Rating 9/10.",
         "This is without any doubt one of the best films ever made. The plot is pretty complex, four persons (all terrible amateurs) trying to live their lives without mutch knowledge 'bout the subject. The conversations are wonderful, the acting is awesome (especially Isabelle Huppert, her performance is a masterpiece you haven't seen since...Vertigo?). This is the only film I've ever seen three times in a row.I couldn't stop myself. An interesting thing about it is that not only the main, but even the smallest and least important characters are truly amateurs. The police girl, the video store guy, the cafÃ© girl... Ain't we all after all?",
         "Quirky, odd, brilliant. This is the best use of deadpan delivery I've ever seen. Martin Donovan is excellent. If you're going to rent a Hal Hartley movie you should start with this one; it's the most accessible and the funniest, and also the least stagey.",
         "Hartley is one of the most interesting directors working. Many associate him with French intuitives, but I think his experiments are more intellectual, more New York. His films are not only about other films, but exist in a world abstracted from them where almost everyone else insists on wallowing in the same space they reference. This is still an early work, which I had the opportunity to see with its purported referent: 'Band of Outsiders.' Writing as a fulcrum; performance as porn; film humor as a selfaware deadpan. Sex as an abstract creation. Pain as an act. Huppert as walking hair, early Posey on her way to Jackie K. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",
         "This is a mystery that seems to want to satirize mysteries in general and while I had a little trouble with the script its the presence of Isabelle Huppert that adds the interest to the film. Story is about a former nun named Isabelle (Huppert) who meets a man (Martin Donovan) with amnesia and helps him out. There is also a French porno actress named Sofia (Elina Lowensohn) who was the one that pushed the man out the window and gave him amnesia. She meets Edward (Damian Young) who is hiding out from corporate gangsters and they seek some floppy discs with pertinent information on them. Sofia steals the discs and tries to get money from the gangsters but they doublecross her and grab Edward whom they recognize. Meanwhile Isabelle and the man try and figure out who he is and they find a connection to Sofia and find her in trouble with gangsters chasing her. Film is directed by independent veteran Hal Hartley and he adds some very unusual touches to the script and the characters. The gangsters chasing everyone were former accountants and they talk like accountants even when they are about to torture someone. But the heart of the film is Huppert and I have always found her fascinating to watch. In this film she appears to be very docile and timid but at the same time we can see that she craves excitement and love. In some of the scenes Huppert has nothing to say and she just allows her gaze to wander off and I found these moments very effective as she seems to be thinking of something relevant in her life. Even when she does nothing she's interesting to watch and its one of the reasons why she is considered on of the best actress's in the world. Also, Parker Posey appears as a punk girl and Tim Blake Nelson pops up as a detective. Offbeat film mat be to different for the casual viewer but fans of Huppert should take a look.",
         "I am ashamed to admit that I have only just discovered Hal Hartley. Fortunately, not too late, as I think I still have enough time remaining on this planet to hunt up and watch all of his other films. I'm getting a real chuckle out of reading all the one-star reviews here by people who just don't \"get it\". I don't blame them, really, but there should be some way of warning them not to do it; not to embarrass themselves by displaying their shallowness. If it's slick predigested Hollywood pap liberally peppered with explosions they're looking for, they're in the wrong place. Hal Hartley rules. If he's made better films than \"Amateur\" then I'm in for a real treat."
