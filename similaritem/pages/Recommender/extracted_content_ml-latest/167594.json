In \"Freedom\" he escapes through a hole in the fence and makes it to a hamburger stand and a hotel. In \"Danger\" he is running away from two men in black coats and ends up in the smoky atmosphere of a bar singing THRU THE WIRE with the Leningrad Cowboys (those of the \"reverse ducktail\" hairstyle that sticks a foot and a half in front of their faces, and boots with two foot curled toes). \"Punishment\" finds him shot in the back by the men in black coats who are pursuing him, and in \"Finally Together\" he is picked up by a blonde in a Chrysler (Kirsi Tykkylainen - who is also in the short \"Those Were the Days\" and sings this song in the concert film TOTAL BALALAIKA SHOW) and they escape whilst drinking Coke from a plastic bottle."],
