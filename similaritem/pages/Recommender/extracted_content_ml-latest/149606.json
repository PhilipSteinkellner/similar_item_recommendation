         "This movie had already garnered expectations of epic proportions due to the cast, crew and the director, Mr. Sanjay Leela Bhansali. This movie had been in the making for over a decade and hence had already created ample curiosity in the moviegoers minds. After watching the movie, I was at a loss of words. I don't even know where to begin! The music, screenplay, acting, dialogues and the beautiful story of 3 complex characters - everything is magnificent and spectacular! This movie is poetry in motion, easily one of the most epic tales in Indian history being translated in such a classy yet relatable manner on screen! Each scene and each dialogue gets the viewers completely hooked! People were involved and taken back into the 18th century - such was the appeal of the movie! The acting is PHENOMENAL! Ranveer Singh has always delivered fabulous performances, but this performance will be remembered until the end of his career as the performance that catapulted him into the hearts of the Indian cinema lovers. He has done a beyond brilliant job and as a viewer, we laugh, cry and root for him throughout the movie! He's the out and out star of the film. Priyanka Chopra is her usual magnificent self, nothing else can be expected of her after delivering award winning performances in Barfi and Mary Kom. She lights up the scenes she's in. It's amazing how she's good at dance, acting and emoting on screen! Her pain as Bajirao's first wife is captivating and makes the viewers feel for her! What else can be said about the ruling queen of Bollywood, Deepika Padukone, that hasn't already been written!! She is a spectacle all by herself! She makes us cry, laugh, weep, and look at her in awe! She's fabulous in the kathak number, \"mohe rang do laal\" and she shines in every scene of the film! Especially in the scene where she meets kashibai and in the scene where she is jailed! Her eyes are truly the window to Mastani's soul! She matches Ranveer''s energy and their chemistry is undoubtedly historic and classic! What fabulous acting! The supporting cast is a marvel in itself, Tanvi Azmi as Bajirao's mother is fantastic! Her acting abilities are par excellence, couldn't have imagined anyone else in that role! The music, costumes, scenery, sets and decor are exquisite! Nothing less can be expected from an SLB film! This movie is easily one of the top 5 cinema experiences in the past 10 years! It excels in both content and creativity! I will definitely be watching the movie again, it's simply addictive and outstanding and leaves a lasting impression on the viewers mind. A 10/10 experience! Loved it.",
         "Felt like writing a review before the directors next release. Have seen this tripe when it first released. Revisited it on a DVD. This film is both a costly epic and a fantasy turkey biography, not to mention a miserable n failed attempt at creating a story to overtake Romeo n Juliet n Mughal e Azam. Even at nearly 160 minutes long, this ponderous, talky, and melodramatic biopic fails to impress. The critics in India are just impressed with the sets and costumes. Agree, the movie was grand with its look, the sets erected were lavish, the cinematography by Sudeep Chatterjee was splendid but if the film is boring, then cinematography ain't enough to save a disaster. As one reviewer on IMDb rightly said about the mess. The director has no clue whether he is making a 17th century historical epic or a Rohit Shetty flick or a fantasy action epic or romantic melodrama or erotic poem here. Watch the scene with Priyanka. Straight outta Kamasutra. Every historical epic film will have a battle or action sequence. Well, this film has only two, one in the beginning n the other towards the end. But the worst part is not the less amount of battle sequences, it is the execution. Very disappointed by Bhansali's handling of the battle sequences. The cgi/sfx were poorly done as the graphics were looking fake. The battle sequences were laughable. It reduced the lead character into a fantasy super hero. The first scene copied straight outta 300 and Ong bk. The other battle sequence was more like a Rajnikant style. Thousands of arrows and the single hand defense tactic was a laugh out loud n WTF. This movie even fails as a historical fantasy. Mastani playing a mandolin. Hohoho. Mandolin existed in India during that time? A prime minister/military leader dancing with the infantry n cavalry. Hohoho. That was hilarious. The moves. Maybe the military leader was on Datura given to him by some god man. Wait, i forgot about the dialogues. Cheesy ones mate. Referring one another as vegetables n fruits was epic. That too, in Nana Patekars voice. The rest of the movie is dreadful, a clunker script delivered in a cluster of accents. The accents were silly. Nowhere do we get to see Bajirao or his first wife speak in the Marathi language. May be they were promoting Hindi our National language during that era. In short, this film is an agonizing experience in every category I can think of and others still waiting to be invented. This film is a bloated, overlong, and frankly boring epic. It is a rather slow because of the horrendous editing n at times tedious and soporific film that is far away from being great.",
         "Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Mangum-Opus 'Bajirao Mastani' finally arrives. Been in the news for more than a decade, this period piece, fortunately, is worth the wait. Its A Well-Made, Well-Acted Motion-Picture, that holds your attention at most times. 'Bajirao Mastani' narrates the story of the Maratha warrior Peshwa Bajirao I of the Maratha Empire (Ranveer Singh) and his second wife Mastani (Deepika Padukone). 'Bajirao Mastani' is epically mounted & Bhansali has Directed the film with enviable ambition. The scale of the film is something to watch! The visual appeal is tremendous. But, what makes 'Bajirao Mastani' further more memorable, is its human-conflict between its primary characters. The relationship of Bajirao & Mastani is sharp, and even the relationship between Bajirao & his first wife Kashibai (Priyanka Chopra), is compelling. Watching the warrior torn between love, politics & religion, often grabs your attention. I was involved in Bajirao's quest to give his women the respect they deserve, despite the evil-heads who intended to ruin it. Having said that, 'Bajirao Mastani' isn't without its share of blemishes. While the first-hour is arresting, the second-hour takes a dip & the pace drops. Also, the film overstays its welcome by a good 20-minutes, that certainly needed some trimming. A crisper & sharper second-hour would've only enhanced the overall impact! The Screenplay is fierce, but undeniably romantic & emotionally charged. The characters are nicely written out & so are their interactions. But, the second-hour needed a stronger punch. Bhansali's Direction is Grand. Its pure ambition, on celluloid. And the accomplished Filmmaker has handled the film with precision. Cinematography is Magnificent. Editing is mostly good, but it needed to be sharper. Art & Costume Design are flawlessly done. Action-Sequences are fabulously executed. Bhansali's Score is enchanting. Performance-Wise: Ranveer Singh is extraordinary Bajirao. The terrific actor sinks his teeth into the part & delvers a phenomenal performance. Right from his flawless Marathi diction, to his correctly done body-language, Ranveer scores a home-run. Deepika Padukone is wonderful as Mastani, portraying her part with complete honesty & understanding. Priyanka Chopra shines as Kashibai. She's in great form here. Tanvi Azmi as Radhabai, Bajirao's widowed mother, is electrifying. Its a pleasure to watch the veteran cast in a role that offers her scope to show her brilliance! On the whole, 'Bajirao Mastani' is definitely worth a watch.",
         "I went to see this film while my wife was at the ballet. I don't watch many Bollywood films, and usually the lighter kind, so I was coming to this film with almost no context. Also, to me, this was a foreign language, subtitled film so I missed any subtleties of language. I really liked it. It was a true epic, wonderfully staged with seamless CGI and a consistent mellow look and feel to it. The leads (and lots of others) were really handsome/beautiful, and excellent actors. The dancing and singing was great and the story was well told. The costumes were sumptuous - Mughal miniatures come to life. To an Australian this was of course an exotic film, so although it was slow there was always something to be looking at and wondering about. On the con side, the Hindu / Moslem theme was hammered home rather obviously, the Brahmin priests were one-dimensionally nasty, and (apart from one boatman) everything took place in a idyllic palace bubble - punctuated by a few battles. However I would recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy an epic cinematic experience Indian-style.",
         "this movie helps restore the fast depleting hopes with Bollywood movies. The passion with which this movie is made shines through some class acts from each involved. the animation and sets allow a submerging experience. Ranveer offers a brilliant performance and a very promising future. His accented Hindi and well pronounced Marathi complete him in his role as Bajirao. Deepika and Priyanka are best fits in their roles and don't feel off track even for a bit. Priyanka does a good job of conveying with her expressions more than her words. The placement of songs is done nicely. a must watch for all moviegoers and history enthusiasts. the movie leaves us all with a good message at the end.",
         "the most awesome movie of this year came in the end that is Bajiao Mastani, there are no complaint about this movie from my side because there was no flaw in it except some of the cinematic errors. Even though I don't understand why it is reviewed 5.9 on IMDb after this. The things I like about the movie was that everyone acted perfectly, and everything was according to historical time line(sort of). Really like how Ranveer Singh and been moulded like an actor, Priyanka Chopra too was nice but should have been given more dialogs and Deepika Padukone as mastani was awesome no one would have acted like her. Awesome direction By Sanjay Leela Bhanshali,full marks to him for that. In the end everything in the movie was fantastic. IT TOO GIVES AN MORAL THAT LOVE IS NOT BINDED BY RELIGION. By which i come to the point that it delivers on Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Love with Drama cliché's. On funny note I want to say that we've got Joffery Baratheon of Indian Film industry. The pairing of the movie was also fantastic, I thought after Goliyoon ki Raaslella the paring wouldn't work. And the movie was poetic too. The sets were awesome. On the Negative side there were lot of Overacting done by the actor Ranveer Singh, first I thought it was the script then I thought it was his acting, and there were some useless dialogue placement in the movie too which were not required at all. If this points were taken care off then it was surely 10/10 from my side.( I started grading it from 6) BOTTOM LINE: AN Awesome MOVIE, ONES WHICH WE CAN REMEMBER AND ALWAYS KEEP IN OUR DVD CASE.",
         "Khamoshi, Black, Guzarish, Ram-Leela, Devdas and now Bajirao Mastani. This enigma called Sanjay Leela Bhansali lives only so that he just make films which lives forever. With a stellar cast he unfolds another epic love story, 'Bajirao Mastani', which has been a 12-year long dream said by Sanjay. One of the best Director of Hindi Films, his vision is big and presentation is a class. The music of 'Bajirao Mastani' is very pure and quite amazing. Beautiful music, beautiful locations, mind-blowing dressing and very energetic. Never saw a beginning of a movie as engaging as Bajirao Mastani. Its an epic film that leaves you wanting for more. I say, You must watch.",
         "Ranveer acting was great direction and music was superb Deepika looking beautiful location screen great a must watch a movie for everyone in your life everything is great go watch... Priyanka Chopra, on the other hand, is the better performer of the two in this film. Priyanka's Kashibai loves her husband to death. Each time Priyanka looks at Ranveer Singh her face lights up like a brightly-lit skyline. When Bajirao falls in love with another woman Kashibai doesn't surrender to destiny. She is no walkover. She protests. She sneers. She is angry. But finally for the sake of her husband's happiness and the larger good, she accepts the situation. Kashibai teaches us the most important lesson of this film. Acceptance of injustice is sometimes the opposite of cowardice. Priyanka conveys all these emotions with near-flawless comprehension of her character's inner world. This is her best to date.",
         "The Story, Overview and Music: Sanjay Leela Bhansali is back with his 12 years old dream he nurtured like a baby titled as 'Bajirao Mastani', which is Bollywood's magnum opus and a reply to Tollywood's Bahubaali. Enthralling from beginning to end, the movie doesn't contain a single boring moment which is a huge plus point for its genre which can often be cumbersome and boring. And that can be large attributed to the visual aesthetics. Each and every frames are picture-perfect shots. From the very opening credits, you know that you are going to travel into a divine universe unraveling the 500 years ago's history (the 1700's). The sets and art direction are so well crafted, huge and super grand. Visual poetry on screen. Kudos to the set designers. The costumes, before describing, I would love to salute Anju Modi (costume designer) and Sanjay's vision of the past. Yes, they have rendered their imagination into a visual bonanza indeed. Ornamental is the perfect word. Every color that was picked for the costumes reflected a mood in addition to visual appeal. Applause! The cinematography is par excellence. The screenplay is multi- dimensional. It leaves you thirsty to know more. The background score is the \"cherries on the cake\". It is soothingly melodious in romantic scenes while explosive in war scenes. The action and the wars are new in Bollywood. First time a movie from Indian has excelled in such scenes. And the dialogues are a marvel. Very few films get you hooked up by its dialogues and Bajirao Mastani is one of them. There are many lines you will take home: the 'Guroor' one is pure cinematic and the 'Cheete ki chaal,..' is beautifully written and used cleverly. As for the music, the album has 10 tracks and SLB as the music director has done a magnificent job. The album is a beautiful blend of Marathi folk and Persian/Muslim influences. So, technically, the film is far superior than any Hindi movie I have seen in the last decade or so. The introductory portions in which they narrate the Peshwa's conquests using semi- animation/CGI were brilliantly performed. It's definitely one of the best of 2015. You are simply left mesmerized. You really are! The story of the film, I'll leave it for you to catch. I won't be a spoiler. I will just say that it is surely a love- triangle but one with a big difference. Star Performances: Ranveer Singh as the Peshwa Bajirao Ballad.- He is unbelievably good. Looks, body language, Maratha accent, physical strength in the war scenes. Hats off. I was skeptical about Malhari but it fits perfectly fine. His eyes spoke so many feelings. The anger, the love, the guilt, the passion, the pride, simply a WOW. I have always believed he's got a stupendous amount of untapped talent, and boy does this movie bring out the crazy range of acting skills that he possesses. He hit the right notes at all points. Mark my word, his performance shall make you a fan if you are not. This goes as his career best performance. He should win all 'Best Actor' awards for this. Deepika Padukone as the warrior princess is a marvel. She is beautiful, charming and stuns in songs like Deewani Mastani (I heart heart emoticon her in that). Her restrained half-Persian nuanced acting seemed to jump out less. Her character is one-dimensional. That's the minus point. Her biggest weakness being her poor kathak and you will feel sometimes in war scenes, she just lacked it and in romantic scenes, she went quite below par. Maybe due to parallel filming. She is undoubtedly a treat to watch but is overshadowed by Ranveer and Priyanka in acting. Nevertheless, she gives a remarkable performance but not her best. Priyanka Chopra as the Peshwin Queen Kashibai \u2013 *Breathe* Kashi was the most complex character of the film. It's an arc immensely enjoyable act at the same time heart- breaking. Kashibai might be an image of helplessness but it takes such strength for a woman to respect and protect the other woman your man fell in love with. Priyanka Chopra is terrific, her intelligently expressive eyes speaking volumes, she stood out in her Marathi intonations and prosody. Her no- nonsense Marathi rhythm was bang-on. Her each expression is layered with a thousand emotions, her dialogue delivery is pitch perfect and even in her dance her footwork is crisp and nimble. She crossed expectations in the film. She gets your eyes teary and your heart in pain. Her scenes are the highlights of the film and she owns them. In confrontation scene with Deepika where she goes \"Dil? Kaisa dil?\" gives you goosebumps. She knows her husband loves Mastani but she loves her husband. She can't hate him. The day she married Bajirao, she swore to support her man in his all decisions that make him happy. She knows her husband is no longer hers yet she doesn't want to lose him. The 'Guroor' scene where she calls her husband and tells him to go with his second wife is the scene of the year. In the climax, she comes to her ill husband but the latter calls her Mastani in hallucination and at that very moment you can feel her. She is devastated yet she pleases her husband by acting like Mastani. The lovers Bajirao and Mastani die but it is Kashi who is left behind all alone in pain. She takes forward the journey and raises Mastani's son as hers together with her two other sons. Priyanka's Kashi is so vivid that Deepika's Mastani pales in her comparison. In short, Priyanka Chopra has given a lifetime performance. You won't believe that the same Ranveer-Priyanka who played siblings in Dil Dhadakne Do have given such a soaring chemistry as husband-wife. Watch out for their love making scene. It's HOT. At the end Ranveer stands out, Deepika shines but Priyanka outshines. She leaves a legacy behind.",
         "Its an excellency of Sanjay Leela Bhansali, #BajiraoMastani is a Magestic Indian Epic Drama of Bajirao Peshwa. Whether its the majestic sets, beautiful music , performances of the star casts Sanjay Sir has excelled in each and every frame. After Baahubali this is one movie which is in Hindi originally that you can feel proud of watching it. Deepika is marvelous, Priyanka is excellent and ranveer singh is extraordinary.The song Deewani Mastani itself is a paisa vasool for the quality moviegoers.The war scenes are of world class and may remind you of any good war movies. Its a beautiful love story weaved in with the war plot.this is one movie which is not to be missed...Go for it",
         "As the epic love-tale of Bajirao-Mastani releases today, my joy knew no bound to watch it which has been in the news for quite some as Sanjay Leela Bhansali was determined to make a film on the lives of Peshwa Bajirao, Kashibai and Mastani for a long time.Barring Bahubali and Jodhaa Akhbar, Bollywood audiences are accepting the period drama in a big way. Can Bajirao Mastani continue the trend ? Well, we have to wait and watch for it. Bajirao Mastani tells the story about Baji Rao Ballal Balaji Bhat, widely known as Baji Rao I(played by Ranveer Singh), who was a brave warrior whose battlefield antics won him great accolades and praise from one and all. Much like his popularity on field, his personal life too was the center of attraction and his controversial love life with Mastani (Deepika Padukone) is the highlight of the film. The talented director, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, who gave us some memorable films like Khamoshi, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam , Black and some forgettable films like Saawariya and Ram- Leela goes one step back and does a good research on the history and culture of Maratha Warrior, Bajirao, who has not been defeated in battle for a straight 41 times. Kudos to Bhansali and team of writers (screenplay by Prakash R. Kapadia, additional screenplay by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Mallika Dutt Gharde) for doing good job. The battle sequences (action director by Sham Kaushal) have been executed brilliantly. The production design (Sriram Kannan Iyengar, Sujeet Subhash Sawant, Saloni Ankush Dhatrak] is eye-catching and will take you back to the forgotten history. The costume-design is mesmerizing. Music by Bhansali is tuneful especially coupled with well-executed choreography in 'Deewani Mastani', 'Albela Sajan' and 'Pinga' ( this one will remind you of Dola Re from Devdas). Cinematography is mindblowing along with good background score that gels with the mood of the film. However, the editing is loose and screenplay falls apart to some extent. Performance wise, it is Deepika Padukone all the way. She surprises with her charming , bubbly and yet fearless character whom you will fall in love immediately with her innocence. Ranveer Singh will hold your attention as powerful and mystical Bajirao and the actor exudes honoring performance. Priyanka Chopra does well as Kashibai. Tanvi Azmi is terrific. Overall, Bajirao-Mastani should be lauded for surreal direction, exemplary CGI and commendable performances. Good 3/5 \u2013 Ketan Gupta",
         "Bajirao Mastani is sheer brilliance! An epic film that leaves you wanting for more.Realism as a word and theme remains obsolete in the exquisitely crafted world of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's fantasies.Visuals are elephantine.his characteristic style narrates his version of the story in a Mughal-e-azamesque scale of grandiosity, replete with breathtakingly beautiful sets (by Bhansali, Sujit Sriram and Saloni) elaborate and well thought of costumes and accessories (by Anju Modi) and dreamy cinematography. music, screenplay, acting, dialogues and the beautiful story of 3 complex characters - everything is magnificent and spectacular! This movie is poetry in motion, easily one of the most epic tales in Indian history being translated in such a classy yet relatable manner on screen! Each scene and each dialogue gets the viewers completely hooked! People were involved and taken back into the 18th century - such was the appeal of the movie! Ranveer is unbelievable & superlative as Bajirao. Priyanka chopra is amazing & Deepika padukone is just wow! This was your most nuanced performance till date !! Excellent .. !!",
         "What a movie!!! It deserves its place rightfully among all the classics ever made and if any movie has the potential to come close to Mughl-e-Azam ,it is this one. Right from the script to the direction to the background score everything is spot on. Stellar performances only add cherry to the cake. Deepika Padukone,Ranveer Singh and PC are going to win a lot of awards this season.Bhansali's direction is crisp and boy ,those sets were awesome.Your eyes will be glued to the screen till the movie ends and you will wish that movie never ends.Such beauty!!! All in all it is a movie of a lifetime. Don't miss it at any cost !!!",
         "Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 1.9/5 stars (0.4 stars solely for Ranveer Singh's performance) From the first frame, you know you are in a Sanjay Leela Bhansali film. Everything is scaled up, grander than grand. It's all razzle- dazzle, the way only Sanjay Leela Bhansali can turn it on. And then we tear our gaze away from the lush sets and the gorgeously attired actors \u2013 Priyanka Chopra as Bajirao's wife Kashibai, Deepika Padukone as the film's eponymous Mastani ( lover, concubine, second wife all rolled into one) and the equally beauteous Ranveer Singh - and demand the very thing we come to the movies for: a story unfolding on screen. But we chance upon that story only sporadically, in between all the song-and-dances and the set-pieces in the battlefields and the palaces and the sparkling chandeliers, which keeps bringing us back to our original query: Where's the plot point? Also, distorting history and not getting things perfect is one thing, but when a historical figure, revered and honored as much as the great Maratha Peshwa Bajirao is reduced to a new day Ranbir Kapoor in love, then that doesn't sit right by me, regardless of any number of disclaimers at the start. Thankfully, the film doesn't even pretend to be a faithful document of the events that took place in the early 1700s, when the Maratha Empire was in its ascendancy. The facts, such as they are recorded, are not allowed to weigh heavy upon this pretty edifice. There is some chatter of the \"debauched Dilli Darbar\" and ambitions for \"poora Hindustan\"; a few kohled, bearded Mughal invaders show up with their armies, and there a couple of scenes featuring a crafty Nizam. But these are stray mentions, and mere diversions - the real action in \"Bajirao Mastani\" is in the bedrooms and boudoirs and hallways, between Bajirao and brave Bundalkhandi lass Mastani, with Kashibai valiantly fighting a rearguard action. It is hard to imagine anyone else as Bajirao after Ranveer finishes chewing up the part and cracking the Marathi accent. He absolutely owns the film with his swagger, strut, passion, diction, bravado, and remarkably restrained emotions - an actor truly enjoying himself in a role. Priyanka's acquiescing wife has a couple of strong moments ( in fact, the only remotely felt sequence in the film belongs to Chopra and Tanvi Azmi - Bajirao's widowed, ambitious mother - as they ponder over the meaning of love and betrayal, and the man they are tied to). Padukone looks lovely as usual but hasn't melded with the part. Her Mastani is all dressed up but the performance is wishy- washy. She starts off smiling oddly through grim dialogues but has the exact same expression boys with lightsabers sport while making their own sound effects. Her Mastani is obsessed with Bajirao, and while it was perhaps the film's requirement that Padukone look giddily entranced, there are times when she appears completely lost. It doesn't help that she's entirely eaten up by Priyanka Chopra, who, while not in the title, holds her own against Ranveer's character with selflessness and dignity. Chopra's terrific in the part, her intelligently expressive eyes speaking volumes and her no-nonsense Marathi rhythm bang-on. Bhansali, for what it's worth, has gone all out with this one. He's made warrior girls play the banjo; he's made Old Spice salesmen look old; he's created outrageous subtexts about husbands and wives getting each other wet; and he's even saluted world cinema and raised a few red lanterns. But too quickly you tire of all the showiness. The grandiosity wears off. You long for a genuinely moving, exciting story, featuring all these beautiful actors, most of whom are able to pull off characters, but buried under their mounds of clothes. If only he had more to say than the fact that he loves \"Mughal-e-Azam\".",
         "Poor performances from the lead pair, unnecessary melodrama, childish and cheesy dialog, excesses of glitter and slow motion, and worst of all, amateurish direction, completely derail this movie. The source material is really strong and could have led to a classic if properly handled, but the film director and actors fail miserably and make a big mess of it. The only reason I have given the movie even 4 stars is owing to a few good performances, particularly Tanvi Azmi and Priyanka Chopra. I hope some day a good director will remake the movie with good actors and present this timeless story with all the layers that it potentially carries.",
         "One of the best performance by Bansali Sir Ever . Project it as the third spin off from a trilogy started from Hum dil de chuke sanam and Devdas where Salman and Shahrukh Stealed the show , but here Deepika did . Ranveer and Priyanka were lovely to watch but Deepika was far better . Belonging to such a strong and non-entertaining genre , it did entertained us and I will highly recommend you to watch this . Some may have rated it down (Fan wars or something) but believe me , it will show a spike and gradually may end up around 8 or something . Deserves your bucks and after watching it , you will for sure oblige Bhansali Sir to the magic he brought back that was missing from Bollywood for the past few years . Story 9/10 Songs 9/10 Dialogues 10/10 Acting 9/10 Direction 10/10 Overall 9/10",
         "Seriously, I was expecting more from Deepika Padukone in Bajirao Mastani since she is one of the eponymous character in this movie and she can be called this generation's female Bollywood superstar no doubt after her brilliant outing in Piku and Tamasha. Sadly, Deepika failed to live up to my expectations. Her dialogue delivery is so weak in some scenes and her dance in the \"rang do mohe lal\" song just lacks the charm and grace. She seems like a complete misfit for the role of Mastani and looks too tall and modern to be able to carry off the royal look. Deepika just made me feel the need of the supremely talented Aishwarya Rai in many scenes. She just doesn't have varied expressions. Her last scene with her son where she tells him to go with the guards was supposed to melt our hearts. But sadly, it does not. Deepika just seems to be struggling with her emoting abilities. Also, her face when she gets out of a palanquin induces a laugh from audience. Wooden expression at its best! Surprisingly, it's Priyanka Chopra who stole the show from under Deepika's nose despite being a supporting (or is it?) character. Her confusion, anger and jealousy after learning of her husband and Mastani's (Deepika) love is really well etched. Priyanka seems to have developed a knack for stealing the show in every single movie of hers. With this movie, the stage is all set for Ranveer Singh to claim the throne of this generation's super star from the Khan trio. This guy is just something else. The way he masters the Marathi accent and the fight scenes is just wow! No one can be Bajirao other than Ranveer! He nails it like a pro. The only sore thumb of this movie is sadly Deepika Padukone! It's really sad how she ends up being overshadowed despite being the central character. Even Tanvi Azmi as Bajirao's mother gives a strong account of herself but Deepika simply fails to do so!",
         "This is undoubtedly one of the better movies to come out of Bollywood this year. And that's saying something, since this year is almost at its end. Tremendous acting from Ranveer's Peshwa Bajirao. This is a pure work of fiction, with some borrowed historical elements. However, Bhansali manages to recreate a believable world, and the actors back him up. Being a musical, the music is from the director himself, and suits the movie. Priyanka as Kashi Bai, and Deepika as Mastani also give no cause for complaints. But Bhansali is getting repetitive with the endings in his movies. No spoilers, but it's always great to watch something new, and not to go to the movie hoping it would not play out like some other movie :(",
         "Another historical tale, a visually authentic one after 'Jodha Akbar'. Top class performances by all actors - Ranveer outclasses as Bajirao with his awesome acting, 10/10 marathi accent and accurate mannerisms. Priyanka is awesomely graceful and exhibits perfectly, insecurities and mixed emotions of Kashibai. Deepika aka Mastani looks breathtakingly beautiful in each frame and gives yet another class act after Tamasha War scenes have been shot well and look authentic Cinematography is classic and matches the grandeur of a SLB film Music is more marathi folk style. However, too many songs spoil the rhythm of otherwise well knit screenplay 2nd half is sluggish and dragged and this is where movie suffers Overall its a visual treat for eyes and literally takes you to the medieval era of peshwas, an unexplored terrain in Bollywood so far.",
         "It was really refreshing and pleasing to the eye. I could not tear my eyes from the screen the whole time. If you are looking for a love story that is not sappy dipped in damsel in distress stereotypes then this is a must watch. The chemistry between Deepika and Ranveer was sizzling hot. These two are the dynamic pair. I bet in coming years their pairing is going to grab massive attention. I can't even think of another duo playing such strong characters. I particularly loved the cinematography and the visual blast of colors the movie brought to us. The opening scene was superb and the battle ground was realistic for a change for Bollywood movies. Songs were entertaining except \"Pinga\" which i personally didn't like. \"Deewani mastaani\" was my favorite song video. Amazing movie. I am going to go watch it again. Highly recommended.",
         "This is a wondrous saga...very much needed to revive the image created by \"Ram Leela\" which to me was an epic fail for all; writer, director and actors..... While booking the tickets, I thought there is much similarity between the \"Ram Leela\" and \"Bajirao Mastani\"...the lead characters, the historical plots and even the names of movies...Ram-Bajirao-Ranveer and Leela-Mastani-Deepika.... and hence, I went with the outlook of this one being an epic fail as well...but it turned out to be completely opposite.... Sanjay Leela Bansali has, i would say, re-earned his name by working with same actors to create a marvel.....an epic love story after Devdas..I would like to adorn Bajirao Mastani with all the adjectives possible... perfect plot, perfect casting, impeccable direction, splendid screenplay with awesome dialogs awesomely delivered, super graphics and super duper acting by Ranveer, Deepika and Priyanka.... Being a fan of romantic movies, I am left with another love story to savor...this is going to be on my favorite list from now on.... And of course, I love you Deepika.....",
         "An excellent piece of hard work by the entire team. Fantastic direction and commendable acting by Ranveer. Equally supported by Dipika and Priyanka. Fight scenes are class apart and really visualize the era it belongs to. Dance, emotions, set design...nothing falls short of the other. I did not watch old SLB films and this one makes me feel I must watch all now. The best is seeing Ranveer so mature and proving his presence in the lead role. Fully justified. Its been 24 hrs I watched this movie and it had such powerful impact that it is still running somewhere in the subconscious mind. Overall a real show of talent by all! Thanks to the entire crew for this remarkable effort and exploring these plots.",
         "Khamoshi, Black, Guzarish, Ram-Leela, Devdas and now Bajirao Mastani. Hands down one of the best recent released movie..loved story line cinematography and story.. Bajirao Masta is one of the most visually impressive films that have come from India. Everything about this film is good - Story, direction, beautiful cinematography, haunting score and amazing visuals (though they lack some details at some places in my point of view). All the actors are good and perform their part really well. Ranveer is okay in the beginning but transforms into a behemoth during the second half. This guy is a natural. He doesn't act exceptionally but his presence is enough to give you the feels. All in all really enjoyed the movie right from beginning to end..must watch in my point of view if you like Bollywood movies with some substance",
         "What an amazing movie from SLB once again with beauuuuutiful sets, clothes, music and characters and an amazing story based on true facts, which current Indian cinema is lacking a lot. Acting is superb and the flow of movie is amazing. As always Sanjey movie depicts the depths of a fantasy imagination where even the pain is in beautiful colors. A must watch for people who love good music who love elegant sets and admire the grand ruins. Apart from sets the graphics job is done very well and war scenes are narrated in a true gladiator way. Clothes were drop dead gorgeous. I wish if any of my tailors could make such superb pieces. Deepika Ranveer and Priyanka did amazing job. Do watch you will remember it for a long time :)",
         "Nice costumes, great cinematography and good music, lyrics and direction of the movie. Performance-wise: Ranveer Singh and Priyanka Chopra followed by Deepika Padukone. Here are the ratings. Ranveer Singh: A; Priyanka Chopra: A; Deepika Padukone: B+; Overall, a great movie to watch. Ranveer Singh did his career-best performance. That was amazing to watch him prepare for and act as Bajirao. Priyanka Chopra completely eclipsed Deepika Padukone. Bhansali should have switched roles for PC and DP. PC is at her splendid best that showcased her acting brilliance. This was quite evident when the duo danced together. Overall, PC is a much better actor than DP in this movie. Deepika Padukone did whatever she could. Overall, a great movie to watch!!!"
