         "In \"Anne of Green Gables\" (1934), Marilla Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (O.P. Heggie), middle-aged siblings who live together at Green Gables, a farm in Avonlea, on Prince Edward Island, decide to adopt a boy from distant orphanage to help on their farm. But the orphan sent to them is a precocious girl of 14 named Anne Shirley (Dawn Evelyn Paris-a veteran of Disney's series of \"Alice\" shorts who later would adopt her character's name). Anne was only 11 in Lucy Maude Montgomery's source novel but the same actress could not credibly go from 11 to college age during the course of the story. The movie suffers somewhat from this concession, as many of Anne's reactions and much of what she says would be far more entertaining coming from an eleven-year-old than from a teenager. As in the book, Anne is bright and quick, eager to please but dissatisfied with her name, her build, her freckles, and her long red hair. Being a child of imagination, however, Anne takes much joy in life, and adapts quickly to her new family and the environment of Prince Edward Island. In fact Anne is the original \"Teenage Drama Queen\" and the film's screenwriter elected to focus on this aspect of her character. Which transformed the basic genre from mildly amusing family drama to comedy. A change that delighted audiences and that continues to frustrate reader purists. Since the comedy is very much in the spirit of Montgomery's story I can see no reason to take issue with the changes, but let this serve as fair warning to anyone expecting a totally faithful adaptation. The comedy element is the strength of the film as it is one of the earliest self-reflexive parodies of Hollywood conventions. The actress Anne Shirley was one of Hollywood's all- time beauties and the film is in black and white. So much of the amusement is in seeing the title character's endless laments about her appearance and hair color contradicted by what is appearing on the screen. Anne regularly regales her no nonsense rural companions with melodramatic lines like: \"If you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow to me\". Perhaps the funniest moment is when she corrects the spelling of her name on the classroom blackboard. Tom Brown does a nice job as Anne's love interest Gilbert Blythe and Sara Haden steals all the scenes in which she appears as the Cuthbert's pompous neighbor. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",
         "Never viewed this film and consider it a great Classic with great veteran actors. In the period that this film was made, people in America were different, there was no TV or all the modern things we have today, except the Radio and the starting out of great films being made in Hollywood. Sweet innocent tales of young romance between a young girl or guy was viewed differently than it is today. Ann Shirley,\"Murder My Sweet\",'44 played a young orphan gal who was called Carrot Top because of her red hair and found herself being taken into a home of two elderly folks, who were like two wise owls and watched over Ann Shirley. It was a small town and everyone knew everyone and if anything happened, the entire town found out about it within minutes. It is a down to earth film with nice decent people trying to help each other in a very very simple way of living. Today, it seems very corn ball and stupid, but believe me, this was the way people were in America during the 1920'. & 30's and they were a great generation that loved good family films.",
         "Vivacious & irrepressible, ANNE OF GREEN GABLES brings unlooked-for happiness into the lives of a lonely old sister & brother on Prince Edward Island. Lucy Maud Montgomery's well-loved novel comes to life in this wonderful little movie. Excellent production values, a literate script and first class performances gives the story exactly the touch of quality it deserves. Taking her professional name from the character she portrayed, actress Anne Shirley is a joy as the red-headed fourteen-year-old orphan who completely alters the lives of her new guardians. Completely assured in her starring role, Miss Shirley is a delight, entertaining the viewer with Anne's boundless imagination, quick temper and not-so-secret sorrows. Playing the stern spinster who gives the girl a home, Helen Westley also completely commands her role; the viewer will enjoy seeing this sharp-tongued woman slowly unbend to Anne's affection and child-like innocence. Australian character actor O. P. Heggie gives one of his finest performances as Westley's shy, gentle brother who welcomes Anne into his heart from the moment he arrives to fetch her from the railroad station. Tom Brown most agreeably plays the schoolboy who quickly grabs Anne's attention. Sara Haden is appropriately prickly as a nosy neighbor. Charley Grapewin makes the most of his few moments as Avonlea's doctor.",
         "Director: George Nichols Jr., Novel: Lucy Maud Montgommery, Script: Sam Mintz, Cast: Anne Shirley, O.P. Heggie, Tom Brown, Helen Westley I bought this film mostly out of curiosity because we have the 1985 Keven Sullivan version which my wife and I both enjoy so we wanted to see what this early version was like. Although the 1985 version is better, this is better than I thought it would be. I haven't had a chance to read the book so I don't know how either film relates to the book but the 1934 version is only about 80 minutes long whereas the 1985 one is 3 hours long. Consequently, much is cut out in this earlier film. Ann's friendship with Diana Berry is way underdeveloped and before you know it, she is already in college! The 1985 version is much more of a coming of age film. A lot of time is spent on the relationship between Ann and Diana. The acting is pretty good in this film. It doesn't really compete with the 1985 film because that has an absolute perfect cast but they were good here also. Much of the lines in this film are the exact same as the 1985 version. O.P. Heggie and Helen Westly did a fine job as Matthew and Marilla. Their perceived characters are much like Richard Farnsworth and Colleen Dewhurst in the 1985. Anne Shirley was played by--well--Anne Shirley. Her birth name was Dawn O'Day. She changed it to Anne Shirley after this film. She had a cute personality in this film. If you are a fan of the 1985 version, you might want to get this also. The shorter length is another reason to buy this DVD. The 1985 version is of epic length so watching it is more like an event. So this one is good if you want just a small dose of Anne. IMDb also lists a silent version from 1919 but it is stated that there are no known prints of the film. That is a shame.",
         "B-picture-level adaptation from RKO, modestly budgeted, with OK performances. Anne Shirley (who took her screen name from this role) looks rather older here than in some of her contemporary appearances. Film is much too rushed (the ending posits and wraps a major medical and romantic crisis in about 5 minutes), and the all-indoor shooting is no plus. No match whatever for the lovely Canadian miniseries version of 1985, whose leisurely pacing allowed better character development.",
         "In old Prince Edward Island in Canada, country folk O.P. Heggie and Helen Westley are awaiting the arrival of a young boy to help them out on their farm. When Heggie gets to the station, he finds only a teenage girl waiting. It is Anne Shirley (character name AND actress), a freckled, redheaded ball of fire. Heggie instantly takes to her, but Westley is none too happy and demands her return. She allows her to spend the night, which causes her to soften towards Shirley. When she sees the woman who has agreed to take her off her hands, Westley changes her mind. Shirley remains feisty, telling off obnoxious neighbor Sara Haden, who instantly judges her by appearance. Westley makes Shirley apologize, which she does, on her own terms. In school, Shirley gets the attention of handsome Tom Brown whom she spars with at first, and tries to play little miss fix-it upon learning that her foster mother has a resentment against Brown's family. As Anne grows up, she matures into a lovely young woman, yet all the while keeping the spark that added so much life to Heggie and Westley's home. Made the same year Shirley Temple began her reign as the Little Miss Fix-It over at 20th Century Fox, \"Anne of Green Gables\" was RKO's hope of having another \"Little Women\" on their hands with a peppy young girl changing the lives of everyone around her. Anne Shirley, formerly Dawn O'Day, is excellent in the title role, and it doesn't get any better than when she tells off Sara Haden (\"Andy Hardy's\" Aunt Millie), then apologizes while repeating her earlier tirade in politer terms. She would remain an RKO contract player for 10 years. Haden,it must be noted, doesn't play the gossipy neighbor as a one-dimensional character, using Shirley's apology too to admit she might have been wrong about her. Helen Westley and O.P. Heggie are absolutely perfect as her foster parents, and young Tom Brown makes an appealing young beau. Charley Grapewin (Uncle Henry of \"The Wizard of Oz\") is a local doctor. A sequel with Ms. Shirley as an adult Anne (now a teacher) was made by RKO 6 years later. It has also been remade for TV and adapted several times as a stage musical. An enjoyable light-hearted drama that makes one long for simpler times before life, and the world, got overly complicated.",
         "POSSIBLE SPOILERS I caught this on TCM (Turner Classic Movies, a.k.a the \"old movie channel\") and I found it to be clean, cute, funny at times, and it had a nice happy ending. It's a good film, not great, but not horrible, either. The film does some justice to L.M. Montgomery's novel, however, in the book, \"Anne of Green Gables,\" Matthew experiences a heart attack (or stroke...can't remember) and he dies. It's completely the opposite in the movie. Gilbert and Anne didn't hook up in \"Anne of Green Gables\" book. They finally got together in the third book titled \"Anne of Windy Poplars.\" In the film, it shows a budding romance between the two of them. It's also amazing that they try to squeeze 3 years of Anne's life into 90 minutes. In the book, Anne was 11 years old; in the film, she's 14. The film wasn't entirely true to the novel, which was disappointing, however it still was enjoyable. It's much different than the 1985 Disney version. In Disney's version, Marilla is much more gentle and nice than the one in the 1934 version. Matthew was pretty much the same, personality-wise. From both the book and Kevin Sullivan's 1985 movie, Diana Barry has black hair. In the old 1934 film, she's a blonde. In this movie, Anne annoyed me a little bit due to her excessive talking, which makes me wonder about the people who hang around me (since I talk too much as well....LOL). All in all, I give the movie 3 out of 5 stars. Still, the 1985 version with Megan Follows as Anne is much better than this movie. However, for all you purists (like me) out there, I suggest renting the 1985 movie since it is much more truer to the book.",
         "This is a short, sentimental highlights package that turned out to be RKO's sleeper hit of 1934. Anne Shirley is Anne Shirley (she used her character's name for the rest of her screen career), the cheery, melodramatic, eternally appealing redhead created by L. M. Montgomery. Mistakenly placed with adoptive parents who were rather hoping for the boy they'd requested, her hot temper proceeds to get her into scrapes with friends, neighbours and that cheeky, good-looking boy in her class. There are production and pacing issues. The first hour is a little lacking in atmosphere, then - upon finding loads of the stuff - the film proceeds to race through the rest of the narrative at breakneck speed, with a succession of short scenes that cover five years in about five seconds. It also omits the most memorable bit of the book: Anne dyeing her hair green. For all that, this is a really gentle and rewarding movie, with absolutely charming performances, particularly from Shirley and O. P. Heggie, best-known for his turn as the blind hermit in Universal's seminal Bride of Frankenstein the following year.",
         "As a big fan of the books before I even saw the 80's versions of the movie, I think that the 1934 movie is a fairly good depiction. There is one deviation that they made which bugged me throughout the whole movie. Diana Barry's mother was Miss Rachel in the movie instead of them being 2 separate people. Also Diana had blonde hair, but that I could get past. I'm amused that the actress who played Anne Shirley (with an \"e\") just so happened to be named Anne Shirley, and she does an excellent job playing the character...it's almost as if the character Anne was modeled after the actress Anne. This movie sticks to the storyline very well, so as to quote many lines from the book. Also, Gilbert is still fairly handsome :)",
         "RKO had a reputation for making folksy, homespun pieces of Americana. Anne Shirley (as Dawn O'Day) had been in films since she was a toddler. By 1933 she was in limbo - having played Ann Dvorak as a child in \"Three on a Match\" (1932) and a \"flower girl\" in both \"This Side of Heaven\" and \"The Key\" both in 1934. George Nicholls Jnr remembered Anne's work from a previous film and that's how she got this part. She also adopted Anne Shirley as her stage name. The memorable stories are there - Lady of Shallot in a leaky boat, the \"stolen\" brooch, the \"red hair\" incident. Anne was so right for the role of the chatty, heartwarming orphan. She was heartbreaking in her intensity, her eagerness to please and also her fiery temper. O.P. Heggie was wonderful as the understanding Matthew Cuthbert and Helen Westley was fine as the firm Marilla. Tom Brown was an excellent Gilbert Blythe. Gertrude Messinger, who had also been in films as a small child was fine as Diana Barry. Sara Haden proved she could play someone other than Aunt Millie in the Andy Hardy series, was Mrs. Barry."
