      "reviews": ["In his most recent directorial effort, young South African-born director Taron Lexton tells us very metaphorically about the struggle between the moment we see the woman of our dreams and the moment where we finally win her over. This seven-minute short film has quite a few household names in its cast: Bodhi Elfman plays the main character, while his wife Jenna, Kelly Preston and Nancy Cartwright (Bart Simpson's voice) play minor characters that cross the path of Elfman's character. The interactions with the lead and the huge arrow inside of him were fun to watch and ended right at the point where there was danger it could become repetitive. The elevator scene was particularly interesting and Lexton found a nice way to depict how one moment caused the protagonist (in the most physical description) to struggle with letting anybody near him as in that very moment that place was already taken. The use of Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's version of \"Somewhere over the Rainbow\", which is still the best of the song IMO, was a welcome inclusion and I really loved the way everything around the two was illuminated and bright and shining that very special moment at the laundromat. It was quite a beautiful sight. I'd recommend this short film. It's a pity the director seems to not have worked in five years as he definitely has a nice deal of talent."],
