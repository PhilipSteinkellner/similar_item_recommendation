         "Jaal is a decent action movie (maybe not the best but alright, or average), although a lot more action would have really been better. Sunny Deol rocks in action, and he does not even roar in this movie. This movie has a major twist, and the thrills that follow and end with a brilliant train climax save the film. I love seeing Sunny terminating the terrorists as a true patriot. Basically, this is a good 2nd half action movie, as the action comes late. There are a couple of big surprises in this movie (Watch this film with an open mind, and you will come to know the real story here). Anyways, this is a good time pass. Enjoy!",
         "Typical Sunny Deol movie. But some good stunts and photography. For a change he doesnt shout patriotic dialogues. Not a great film in any meaning of the word but better than \"The Hero\" Most of the stunts are copied from one English movie or another but then isnt that a routine with our movies. Atleast, they are well executed. And Sunny Deol doesnt fly as he did in \"The Hero\". I would recommend this movie on a VHS so that you have the Fast Forward at your command, because the courtship scences suck, bigtime!",
         "This movie was so horrible but there is lots of action which is fine But there are too much worst things about this movie Example 1.I was really disappointed that tabu played a villain role later 2.reema is the worst thing she does not even know what is acting 3.the worst couple of sunny deol and reema 4.i wished tabu should have been out of the movie and reema sen could been replaced with kareena kapoor and another hero like shahid kapoor would have been in this then the movie would have been a huge success Songs are average other artists are excellent mukesh Rishi is great a bad guy 2/10 don't look at this",
         "JAAL is another Guddu-Sunny film together The first half is replete with a much overweight and old Sunny dancing, acting young All the typical type scenes Boring comedy The twist is well handled but the film doesn't go much beyond that and gets routine again towards the end Guddu Dhanoa handles parts well Music is okay Sunny doesn't shout here and he is good Tabu is nice Reema irritates Amrish Puri is okay",
         "Some people think that this movie is not a great movie, but they are so wrong! I think you have to watch the movie very carefully to understand the point of the movie. I'll rate the movie according to me. Acting (Overall) - 8/10 (Great acting) Production - 6/10 (An okay production) Direction - 5/10 (Little bit from failing the direction) Plot - 7/10 (Okaydly good plot) Script - 7/10 (Okaydly good script) Character Development - 8/10 (Great development) Action - 9/10 (Awesome Action) Dialogue Delivery - 7/10 (Okaydly good delivery) Lyrics - 5/10 (One good song. Indian Indian Sher Dil) Editing - 6/10 (Okay Job) Story - 7/10 (Okaydly good story) Overall - 7/10"
