Sumrak has been in prison since he was 16 years old but is pushing thirty now, is well acquainted with prison gang culture and covered with tatoos. Evgeni Koltsov is a former police officer unjustly imprisoned and destined for a death sentence from the other inmates if he stays in prison. Evgeni's former friend, Gagarin, now works for the authorities in the same prison that Koltsov has been sent to and together they hatch an escape plan, taking Sumrak with them to avoid throwing suspision on Gagarin. Sumrak, some kind of gang leader, is only too willing to cooperate because he is looking at another 10 year sentence for crimes comitted in prison. Gagarin takes them to a summer camp for underpriveledged children pretending that they are (none too convincing) police officers volunteering to assist for the summer. Sumrak then retrieves a stash of gang money from prison which he has to look after for a godfather figure. Juggling responsiblity for the children with thier other activities leads them both to learn a few home truths about love and responsibility. However, when a former gang assosiate of Sumrak's is released from prison a deadly confrontation over the hidden money becomes inevitable",

It does this pretty well overall and the two central characters develop nicely over the plot, with Sumrak, a hardened career criminal, learning how to look after children and fall in love (he has been in prison since he was 16 years old), and Koltsov mending a tarnished reputation as a former police officer after being unjustly imprisoned. It is not as sentimental as a western film with a similar plot would have been but it also does not have as many laughs in it as I think there should have been. The acting is fine and the action sequences are well done but ultimately its aim is to tug at the heartstrings."],
