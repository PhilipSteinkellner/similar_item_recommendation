            "content": "> Too slow and dramatised superhero flick, but acceptable.\r\n\r\nI can't say I liked the previous films and not this one. In fact, I kind of enjoyed watching this reboot. It was much better than what I have heard about it. At least it did not sound like a loud and lousy like any modern sci-fi flicks, chasing bad guys, bombing cities and downing buildings. But as a superhero and sci-fi film, it had its moment, only at the end.\r\n\r\nObviously the film was too slow and dramatisation was a backslash keeping the youngsters (audience) in mind. I actually expected hefty stunt sequences. Without actions, a superhero movie is like a limbless spider and toothless shark. If the web and tooth are the superpowers, then they must handle it quite smartly. So that is where this film failed to be a clever. This film had 4 superheroes and until the climax they were impotent. Which means the only superhero movie in the recent time that meant for older people. Precisely to say, if you are a 30+, you might enjoy it as I did. I know I can't talk for you and what kind of movies you like, but I know todays youngsters who refuse dramas and accept action-adventures.\r\n\r\nI agree it did not deliver as it should have been as a theatrical feature where surround speakers are ready to give us a breathtaking sound mix. I felt it some kind of a television episode. Because that is how the modern television series are presented. Personally, I would like to say that don't mind my words and the review, because I usually enjoy all the films I watch. So this one was average to me, but definitely not a bad and I won't slam it. Though I recommend it for old people who does not like modern high-octane stunts.\r\n\r\n6/10",

It's not a bad film at all, just not as fast paced as the previous version which I quite liked too ... mind you, I am 60+ so maybe that has something to do with it. A scifi/action film for the older generation perhaps? I really enjoyed it. I gave it 4/5 stars here.",

            "content": "I was actually not having great hopes for this movie giving how Hollywood have screwed up with a lot of my favourite super heroes (Spiderman, Fantastic Four, Dare Devil and a few others). Having said that maybe there was still a glimmer of hope given that some of their latest Marvel work have been rather okay. Unfortunately this is not the reboot of the Fantastic Four that I, and a dare say the fans, hoped for.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I do not understand is why the dumbass script writers that Hollywood employs always have to change the basic story of a set of characters that have a solid fan base? There was nothing wrong with the original story, and thus origin, of the Fantastic Four and the source of their powers. Maybe I am just old-fashioned but still.\r\n\r\nThe second gripe I have with this movie is the nonsensical stuff with members of the Fantastic Four, especially Ben, being deployed by the US military. It is just so clich√©. Lazy script writing plain and simple. Unfortunately this also causes the movie to not really feel like it is a Fantastic Four movie. The team is split up and it is not until the very end that they actually become a team, gets a headquarter and so on. Big fail as far as I am concerned.\r\n\r\nHaving said all that, I do not think it is as bad as some people claim. There are some good stuff in there. The story is not all bad after all even though it is not exactly to my liking and the special effects are quite okay. One thing that annoys me with the story is that the role of Reed is really diminished and he is never really allowed to show of his powers. Yes, I know, there are some \u201cstretching\u201d moments but, well, meh! To add to the pain the actor cast as Reed is, in my mind, totally unconvincing.\r\n\r\nThe bad guy is also somewhat underwhelming and thoroughly predictable. As I said a classical Hollywood concoction aimed towards the less intelligent viewers. I do not understand why Hollywood seems to be so bent on repeating the same mistakes over and over again?\r\n\r\nWell, as I wrote, the movie is not as bad as some people claim but it is far from great. Given the abysmal reviews I am afraid that we will not be getting a sequel which is a shame. This is one of the (few) Marvel comics that I read as a kid (in Sweden we did not get treated to that many of these kind of comics) so it is indeed a bit of a disappointment that they managed to screw this movie up\u2026again.",

      "synopsis": "In the year 2007, young Reed Richards does a presentation for his class and states that he wants to be the first person to teleport through dimensions. His classmates laugh at him and his teacher Mr. Kenny (Dan Castellaneta) mocks his goal, but Ben Grimm takes an interest in Reed's words. Later that night, Reed sneaks into Ben's family's junkyard and gets him to help him bring a device into his basement. Reed gets a toy car and attempts to show Ben that teleportation is very real. He activates his machine and fries every transformer in the neighborhood, but he manages to teleport the car and sees a pile of rocks where the car used to be. Ben tells Reed he's insane. Seven years later, teenage Reed (Miles Teller) and Ben (Jamie Bell) are best friends entering a science fair to show off their machine. Reed teleports a kid's model plane but causes an energy surge that breaks a basketball net, disqualifying him. He and Ben are approached by Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his adopted daughter Sue (Kate Mara). Impressed by Reed's invention, Franklin invites him to join him in a project at the Baxter Foundation. Ben later gives Reed his old pocketknife as a going-away present. Franklin speaks before a board of other researchers headed by Dr. Harvey Allen (Tim Blake Nelson), who isn't too eager to put young scientists on this project. Franklin wants to use inter-dimensional travel to acquire new resources that can be used on Earth. He later goes to see out Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell), as he is the one that started the project. Franklin finds him in a shack and urged him to go back and work with him, despite Victor being rejected before. Victor only agrees because he has a thing for Sue. Meanwhile, Franklin's son Johnny (Michael B. Jordan) in a street race. He initially stalls out but catches up and puts the pedal to the metal... until his car's engine blows out. Franklin finds Johnny in the hospital as he is leaving with an injured arm and scolds him for wasting his potential, but Johnny resents his dad for putting more focus on his work than his family. Johnny joins the team and quickly befriends Reed. Victor is cold and snobby towards them, but the whole team works together and creates a bigger teleportation machine based off of Reed's designs, known as the \"Quantum Gate\". After the machine is complete, the team sends a little chimp through the other dimension, which they call \"Planet Zero.\" They receive video surveillance of the planet, and they successfully bring the chimp back in one piece. Allen then tells the team that he and the other board members will be recruiting NASA members to be the first human subjects to travel to Planet Zero, despite Franklin trying to convince Allen that the team is ready. Reed and Johnny share a drink with Victor as they lament this news. They decide that they're gonna go ahead and teleport themselves anyway. Reed calls Ben and invites him to join them. The four guys suit up and teleport themselves to Planet Zero. Sue picks up a notice that the Quantum Gate was activated and she calls Franklin to the lab. On Planet Zero, the guys find soil and a green substance that reacts to organic matter. It starts to turn in a bad way and then causes an eruption. Realizing the place is unstable, the guys run back to the Quantum Gate. They climb back up a hill, only for Victor to be hit by a lot of the substance, causing him to fall into it. The other three run back and contact Sue, but Ben's pod gets filled with rocks while Johnny gets hit by a big ball of fire. They're teleported back, bringing a wave of radiation with them that hits Sue as well, making her partially invisible. When Reed comes to, he crawls over to Ben as he calls for help beneath a pile of rocks. Johnny is unconscious and completely on fire. Reed then sees his leg has stretched to an unnatural length and he faints. Reed awakens to find himself strapped to a bed with his limbs stretched out. He repeatedly asks for Ben but none of the doctors answer him. When they leave, he removes the straps and crawls through the air vents as he hears Ben calling for him. When Reed finds him, he sees Ben has been mutated into a huge rock creature. He begs Reed for help, but Reed hears people coming. He promises Ben he'll be back for him, and Reed escapes. He flee from the facility known as Area 57 and flee into the forest. One year later. Allen has used Ben/Thing as an asset in warfare due to his size and strength. He is seen smashing tanks on the field. Johnny/Human Torch has managed to control his fire and flight powers, while Sue/Invisible Girl is exercising her invisibility and force field powers. Both have been given suits to accommodate these powers. Meanwhile, everyone is still looking for Reed. Sue tracks the pattern of the last few places he's been spotted. She gets a reading by tracking his emails, recognizing \"cptn_n3mo\" from when they talked about \"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea.\" Reed is in Panama, able to disguise himself by altering his facial features. He detects that the airbase is breached and he is found by some mercenaries. Reed avoids their attacks by stretching and escaping, but Ben catches him. Feeling betrayed by Reed for abandoning him, he headbutts Reed and has him brought in. Reed is taken to Area 57. Allen tells him that he wants Reed to help reactivate the Quantum Gate, and they may be able to find a cure from Planet Zero. Reed reluctantly agrees to help his friends. After some time, Reed is reunited with the other three and a group of explorers re-enter Planet Zero. They detect a life form in the distance. It's Victor. The explorers bring him back and see his whole body coated in metal, a result of his suit fusing with him and the green substance. Victor awakens and says that he has grown stronger on Planet Zero and feels that he must destroy Earth to recreate Planet Zero in his own image. He starts to manipulate the objects in the room and kills a couple of doctors before blowing up Allen's head. Victor breaks out and continues blowing up heads before getting back to the Quantum Gate. Franklin tries to stop him, but Victor fries him. Before dying, Franklin tells Sue and Johnny to look after each other. Reed, Sue, Johnny, and Ben run after him and follow him through the Gate. Everyone is back on Planet Zero. Victor has opened a black hole in order to absorb Earth matter and destroy it. The four realize they need to take him out in order to take out the portal. Victor continues manipulating the environment against the four, pinning them down. Reed tells them that he may be stronger than each of them, but not all of them together. Sue maintains a force field on the portal briefly while Reed distracts Victor. Ben declares, \"It's clobberin time!\" and punches Victor into the path of the black hole, absorbing and destroying him. Johnny then manages to close the portal while he flies and Sue brings herself, Reed, and Ben back to Earth. The military, while hesitant to continue working with the four, reward them for saving the world and agree to give them a private base of operations. Reed decides the team needs a name. Ben admires the place and comments that it's fantastic. And suddenly, Reed knows what to call the team. The Fantastic Four... end credits.",

         "Based on a scientific project that Reed Richards (Miles Teller) has been developing (which can transfer matter from one dimension to another) the Fantastic Four use themselves as Guinea Pigs in order to transfer themselves to another dimension (in the belief that there is something in this other worldly dimension that will benefit their own planet). However, something goes wrong for our foursome during the transportation process and they end up with drastic physical transformations (some which are much more noticeable than others). Worse still, they tried and failed to save Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and leave him behind believing him to be dead. Later on, a team go back to the other dimension and discover that Victor is still alive and bring him back to Earth in order to assess his condition. But Victor has no intention of staying on Earth and is determined to create a new world in this other dimension and will stop at nothing to achieve his objective. Victor has also suffered a physical transformation, but he has become much stronger and more powerful than his former friends and the Fantastic Four find that they must work together to try to stop him from carrying out his evil plans. The film opens up with some promise whereby we're given an insight into how our illustrious foursome ended up becoming the formidable team that we saw in the earlier films. Despite a fairly promising beginning though this reboot completely fails to bring about a lot of the magic that we witnessed in the 2005 version of this film. A big problem for me lay with the tone of the film; firstly it takes itself WAY too seriously and as a result it made the film quite boring to watch. When watching this it felt like I was watching a science documentary (with all its wordy geeky exposition) rather than what should be a fun comic book type movie. This brings me on to my next point 'What fun'? In the 2005 film (and the 2007 film as well) there was much more in the way of camaraderie between the cast making the film much more fun to watch. As a villain Von Doom isn't particularly well-developed here and I felt his motivations for world-domination were a little sketchy here - I criticised Von Doom's motivations in the original film, but compared to his motivations here they now seem more plausible in retrospect. I appreciate that this is a reboot and therefore the filmmaker's are trying to put their own stamp on things (presumably that explains why Johnny Storm is black in this film and also explains why their powers have been attained in a different manner to the original film). The problem with this reboot is that they've failed to do anything to improve on the original film; the story isn't as interesting, the characters are much weaker and are poorly developed, there is no real exploration of their super powers (this was a big thing in the previous films and made sense as they were a big life-changing aspect for the foursome), but here they just kind of have the super powers and then that's it - off to destroy Victor Von Doom. The only real super power that is explored is that of The Thing and even that super power is exploited in a rather lame way. The cast are another big problem with this film as they totally failed to engage with me (as well as each other); Miles Teller is really bland as Reed Richards (even more bland than Ioan Gruffudd was in the original films) which is surprising as he put in a very good performance in Whiplash 2 years ago. Kate Mara is very pretty, but she's terrible in this film (again probably worse than Alba was in the original films). Michael B Jordan tries his best as Johnny Storm, but he lacks the charisma that Evans brought to the role in the original films and as a result suffers badly in comparison. The Thing for me is probably the best character in the film, but he lacks the touching back story that we lay witness to in the original film and again suffers from not being developed sufficiently enough to make me really care about him here. The ending is also poor and lacks any kind of intensity and tension and has the Fantastic Four doing 'the obvious' to wrap the film up. All in all it's a very disappointing film where the serious tone is perhaps a bigger enemy to the film than Doctor Doom. It's big and bloated, but it's also boring, and lacking in both fun and imagination. I'd recommend giving it a wide berth.",
         "Fantastic Four (or as many call it Fant4stic) is a comic book movie starring Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell, Directed by Josh Trank, was produced by Twenty-First Century Fox, and has the run-time of 100mins (1hr40mins). This is the 4th movie (and 3rd theatrical one) in the Fantastic Four Franchise. Now despite the hate i actually liked the last 2 movies in the franchise (Fantastic Four 2005 and Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer, please don't kill me). Now this Movie has been out for almost a year now but has still been getting much hate. To prove my point I would just like to say the movie has a 9% on Rotten Tomatoes which is tied for the worst rated superhero movie of all time. Let me just say I am NOT a professional critic, I just go to movies to have a good time(as shown with my liking of the old Fantastic Four movies) not necessarily to look for major flaws. However this movie makes that goal rather insufferable. Anyways here it is. A lot of people give a pass to the acting simply because these actors have done good work in other movies. Personally I find this to be a terrible excuse. All of these actors such as Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller just seem like they have no soul throughout the entire movie. It's almost as if the whole time these actors had been forced into making this movie. Also the chemistry between them is just awful. Now let's talk about the pacing. Simply put it I have no idea what they were thinking. Why would you make a Fantastic Four movie and have them do absolutely nothing the whole time except for that horrendous fight at the end. Now let me just say Superhero movies without much action can be done well (Batman, X-Men: First Class, etc.) but if your going to do that you have to having interesting conversations and a good origin story which this movie does not have in any way. Speaking of origin stories, am I the only one who almost hated the first half as much as the second half. I mean I know a lot of people who say that the first half is pretty good and all I have to say is how. It's just a drawn out, overly dark useless story that EVERYBODY knows. Then there's the tone, which let my question why did they think that make a dark and gritty reboot of Fantastic Four would be a good idea. Again let me just say, a darker story of a previously existing light heart movie isn't necessarily bad. But it has to have more reason then some executive saying \"Hey The Dark Knight was popular let's make this just like that.\" Then there's the part I was most regretting talking (or writing) about the Action and Effects. Let's get out of the way that Dr.Doom and CGI Miles Teller Face is awful. What I wanted to talk about was the action sequences (or just the 1 action sequence). To be honest it's the most clich√©, predictable fight ever. Basically what happens is that Dr.Doom makes this ray thing that shoots into earth from the planet he's in and The Fantastic Four have to stop him. So they go into the other planet and try to fight off Dr.Doom separately and fail so they decide to team up and defeat him. What I hate about this fight (aside from it's predictable nature) is that the whole scene is shot in extreme darkness plus it's all out of frame so you can barely tell what's going on. Last, I would like to quickly mention the forgettable score, the incredible amount of plot holes such as Dr.Storm going to a science fair for some reason, Dr.Doom magically making a cape, and Dr.Doom looking at people and killing them but not doing that for the Fantastic Four. Also just to say it is incredibly obvious Fox wanted to make some sort of MCU with this movie and set up an entire expanded universe around this movie when it cannot hold it's own weight as a good movie to do something like that. Conclusion Now as you could probably tell I do not like this movie, it has awful pacing, terrible effects,a rehashed story,and laughably bad action. While many have pointed out that Fox took over the project and made it a generic superhero movie. I agree with that but I still don't think the part that wasn't taken over was even passable. It was just Josh Trank redoing the exact same plot as the 2005 version but slower. But the worst part is that the whole movie is just a set up for more Fantastic Four movies with a set up scene every 5mins. This movie has been called by many the worst superhero movie ever and I will personally agree with that. At least Batman and Robin had an overly joking theme and never took itself seriously unlike Fant4stic which thinks it is going to be the Next Iron Man which could never happen because Iron Man actually made a good movie before setting things up. Overall i think the movie has too many problems to count such as bad pacing, no structure, and awful effects to even be close to recommending. Rating 1/10 Unwatchable",
         "I don't think you can make a movie like this unless you really, truly dislike the content - and harbor a great deal of enmity towards anyone who might like it. The effort necessary to get everything wrong, to miss every beat, to offend every memory that someone might have that would inspire them to go risk *another* attempt at this franchise; that has to come from a place of real disgust, I think. What is amazing is how regularly that kind of pointed loathing seems to be given the reigns of properties that an audience really cares about. Aside from the deep spiritual mistreatment - which is difficult, given how weird and wobbly the Fantastic Four are, to begin with - the pacing is poisonous, with the bulk of the film dedicated to what feels like an attempt at an involved origin story, but where the characters aren't really given anything to do, or to care about. In an attempt to avoid being explicit with motivations, I think, the characters instead limp around under the shadow of intentions - maybe Johnny is upset with his dad? Maybe Ben is looking for purpose? It's possible Richards spent his time in exile trying to help his friends? It's hard to say - better filmmaking could have answered these questions subtly. It didn't happen here. This is a joyless, uninteresting movie, with a cast that looked like they were waiting for something else to start, and I don't understand how they could spend all that money on a movie that looks this bad - designs, to sets, special effects; it's all incredibly dated and generic. One of the worst movies I've ever watched.",
         "Imagine the worst superhero movie you've ever seen. Then forget it because this is by far the worst. When I heard they were doing a remake I thought \" this could definitely work\". You see the old movies from 05 and 07 was in my opinion somewhat dull and half decent. But all the flaws from there suddenly seemed to pale when I saw the remake. 30 minutes in I found myself staring at a bird outside the window, and that was more interesting than the actual movie. Then 15 minutes or something later something finally happened. Our heroes teleports to this alternate dimension and they got there powers and etc etc. The INCREDIBLY SLOW pace is a major problem with this movie. Then there's the casting. I've seen some things that these actors have don previously, before this. Kate Mara in House of Cards for example. And however good they were there it was zero chemistry here. Then of course there is Hollywood back at it again with the political correctness. I don't consider myself a huge comic-book fan, but every one who has ever heard of Fantastic 4 knows that Johnny and Sue Storm are brother and sister and therefore the flame is not black. There is nothing wrong with a director who wants to do his own interpitation of a comic-book series, but changing something as fundamental as this is never a good idea. Compared to this, the old movies seem good.",
         "Over the last decade, we have seen a number of superhero movies get a much needed reboot. After the atrocious Batman & Robin, Batman was brilliantly brought back to the big screen in Batman Begins. When the Spider-Man franchise hit an embarrassing rock bottom with Spider-Man 3, it was reinvigorated with the very likable The Amazing Spider-Man. Eight years on from the dud that was Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and it's time that Marvel's first family got a reboot. With a lot of rumours flying around about trouble on set and the studio not seeming to have total confidence in their product, could 2015's Fantastic Four do these iconic comic-book characters justice? Reed Richards (Miles Teller) is a brilliant young scientist on the verge of discovering how to both transport matter to another dimension and bring it back. Recruited by Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), Reed is given the resources and help, in the form of Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), to to finish what he started in his younger years. When they finally crack inter-dimensional travel, Reed invites his childhood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) to travel to another world along with him and his team. An accident causes their physical form to drastically change. Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben must learn to harness their powers and work as a team to stop Victor, who is hell bent on destroying Earth. The one thing that stood out to me about Fantastic Four is just how unbelievably dull it is. For characters who have such a rich and colourful history in the comics, this really is a pretty drab affair. The film only has a 100 minute runtime however, it feels much longer, dragging its feet and feeling very tired right from the very start. When a superhero movie gets less exciting after they get their powers, something is very very wrong. I had some hope for this film and one of the main reason was down to the fact that Josh Trank was sat in the director's chair. Trank hit the big time with Chronicle, a film that combined the superhero genre with found footage. I can't express just how disappointed I am with Trank because everything about Fantastic Four is just so sloppy. The story is weak, the script is cringeworthy and the special effects are average at best. It all culminates in one of the most boring finales you will ever witness in a superhero movie. Compared to what else you see happen in other superhero movies these days, it all looks and feels amateur. Then there are the performances. Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell are all young actors who have the world at their feet. They have each impressed in their own way prior to Fantastic Four but every single one of them has the range of the cast in Tim Story's Fantastic Four films and waste their talents in Trank's reboot. Fantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I don't see audiences taking to this, at all.",
         "So when I saw that they're \"rebooting\" Fantastic Four, I thought, \"this could actually be really good. This has the chance to start things over and be something great.\" The trailers showed potential - they featured a new premise with some great new concepts. Also, take note that I'm not a superhero/comic book fan. I am a filmmaker, though. Josh Trank is the director of this film. He also directed the film Chronicle, and I think that's a great movie, with several characteristics that are actually similar to this film. I think the first major clue for me that this movie was doomed was, surprisingly, its tagline. \"Change is coming\". As a filmmaker, I know that a big concept movies want to have nowadays is \"everything changes\" - the idea that everything is started over or some big event is going to happen. One of The Amazing Spider-Man 2's taglines was \"everything changes\". Transformers 4 had the tagline of \"the rules have changed\" and \"everything will change\". This film's taglines are \"change is coming\", and \"when you change the world, prepare to defend it\". Movie taglines dealing with \"change\" are typically weak and overused methods of making movies seem like they're creating a \"clean slate\", or for lack of a better word, a reboot. If your movie tagline deals with change - at least make the film somewhat memorable. These three movies weren't memorable. Another major clue for me that this movie was doomed was its running time of 100 minutes. Why? Because when you have a film like this - a reboot, where it has to introduce various new characters, set them up and a new premise/universe, the movie isn't going to be an hour and a half long. It's going to be two hours. Those extra twenty- thirty minutes can make a difference. For the record, the first two Fantastic Four movies had around the same running time. The original film was only six minutes longer. But that movie wasn't the best one, either. I reminded myself of X-Men. X-Men was a great movie. It had a similar running time, but not the same task, as it wasn't a reboot. Yet as the first installment in a franchise, it did a fantastic job at setting things up. There isn't much that's fantastic about Fantastic Four. Now to tell you what's wrong with this movie. First off, the pacing. The running time really is a problem. This film is rushed beyond belief and its plot is nonsensical. The characters' introductions are decent enough, particularly the Fantastic Four, but their roles throughout the rest of the film are disconcerted. It gets very boring when things are meant to be exciting. Exposition can be tiring, but after the exposition ended and the action was supposed to pick up - it didn't. Second, the plot. As I said above, the film's plot seemed interesting. It had potential and it looked like it could go somewhere, especially considering how superhero movies nowadays have managed to flesh out their stories and make them very enjoyable. There are even hints at awesome things to come at certain points. But the film's in shambles. You hope and feel it will go somewhere, but in its hour and a half running time, it feels so empty. One of the reasons for that is the third thing, the writing. The writing isn't good - the film's climactic conflict feels backed up into the end of the movie, because there wasn't enough time to set it up. The writing caused the pacing to be terrible - transitions between scenes weren't good and some scenes either went on for too long or were far too short. This movie shouldn't have been afraid to be longer (or the studio should've let it be that way) - it could have done that and been so much better. I also don't know why the Torch was played by a black actor. Again, I'm not a comic-book fan, and I'm certainly not racist, but I know enough to know that the Torch is white. I don't understand why they couldn't keep him that way. The acting of the Fantastic Four as a whole was \"okay\". But they just didn't feel like a team - there was no bond between them, and that's what should certainly be established in a movie like this. That's a big thing that killed this film, was the lack of teamwork. Seeing them together in the movie just felt so bland because there was no real interaction between them. There are so many big, obvious things wrong with this movie. Speaking of \"things\", The Thing is entirely CGI. No make-up, costume or anything - just a giant, naked rock monster. Yes, he's naked, too. Not even any shorts. Huh. Reboots, remakes, prequels and sequels are pouring in nowadays, and many of them are constantly bombing. Fantastic Four is, unfortunately, one of them. But I'm still very surprised over just how bad it turned out. This film is currently a box office catastrophe.. Very few superhero movies within the last decade have a rating as low as this one does. It currently has a 3.9 rating on here, an incredibly low 9% on Rotten Tomatoes, and perhaps the lowest Metascore I've seen for a modern superhero movie - 27/100. Putting the critics aside, which is what should typically be done - this movie is a boring, weak, irrational attempt to reboot the Fantastic Four series. By the way, a sequel is set to come out in June 2017. Good thing they announced that before the film came out ... a few months ago, of course. If you know what happened to The Amazing Spider-Man series, you may know what could very well happen here. Ultimately, while I wasn't pleased with the film, I do hope you enjoy it more than I did.",
         "Sorry but this movie misses the mark big time. Compared to the 2005 Movie which was perfect, this one is just really bad. The story is OK but not executed well. The characters are not as portrayed in Marvel. Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm, why? Political correctness gone mad. Johnny Storm was not a black man. Kate Mara compared to Jessica Alba? Well there is no comparison really. And Ben Grimm is really just some overdone cgi, nothing compared to Michael Chiklis brilliant portrayal in the earlier movies. The biggest question about this movie for me is why? Why was it made when the 2005 version got it so right?",
         "Terrible movie as previous reviewer writes the pacing is all wrong the characters are bleh you don't feel any attachment to them with them creating no chemistry.The middle section of the movie is drawn out while the climax feels rushed like the director went gosh where running out of time quick rap it up. After the recent awesome avenger movies and the Thors this felt like some hacked together 1990s offering.The story has so many gaps in it with supposedly super smart scientist doing super stupid things and Miles Teller playing Mr Fantastic is just a terrible choice he has no screen presence as a leader. Wait for DVD or what ever and let it go quietly in to the past .",
         "I began watching this movie with great anticipation, however, it really failed me within twenty minutes of it. I still continued to watch it and thought that the movie would get kicked off now but the now never came. The worst thing is that the invisible girl got her powers without going to space and that is so stupid because all my life I have been brought up seeing the girl in space and getting power, not outside of it. More than an hour into movie and there is no action. The villain appears in the last thirty minutes, the fight lasts of 10 minutes and the movie is over. Really a waste of time and money.",
         "Fantastic Four started catching my eye in the casting stage. Seemingly not giving a damn about the source material, it was refreshing to see those kind of balls especially from Marvel. While I welcome Michael B. Jordan as The Human Torch, I wish I could say the same thing about the rest of the film. Fantastic Four is merely a reboot that loses its steam after the first act. Coming in at just over an hour and a half, the film is a rushed piece of reject summer movie drab. The characters are paper thin and about 10 years too young for their respective roles. The visual effects are far from stunning, especially The Thing, whose transformation into the ghastly beast is something closer to a PS2 game than an actual film with a $100 million price tag. Miles Teller proves here that his performance in Whiplash is truly a fluke. As Mr. Fantastic, he struggles to sound like he knows what he is talking about. Perhaps a little more rehearsal time and a little less focus on that cheap looking silver streak in his hair could have benefited him. Kate Mara as Susan Storm is about as idiotic as it can get. Mara is a great actress, there's no other way about it but Kate Mara as Susan Storm is terrible and borderline embarrassing. The biggest shock here in this film is where all the controversy started...Michael B. Jordan as The Human Torch. Jordan's ability to be a badass likable gear head is insanely good. He's the best part of this film by far. If there is anyone that could single handedly carry this film on their back, it is him. The film overall is too dark for Fantastic Four and too shallow for Marvel which leaves it drifting somewhere between ridiculous and not necessary...and at times, both. If there's any movie to see this summer, I can assure you, Fantastic Four is NOT it.",
         "This movie had potential to be bigger than the rather 'bleak' 2005 version. I wasn't overly impressed with the younger cast but thought maybe they would take a different aspect on the film. I was also keen on how Dr. Doom would be portrayed and how he would influence the film as a villain. I couldn't be more wrong. -There was limited character back-story on the Fan 4 -There was no middle just a five minute climax at the end that was hardly gripping -The cringe-worthy quotes towards the end of the film were just punishing to watch -Dr. Doom looks like a Droid and goes completely insane over a minor issue and the movie doesn't quite explain why -Dr. Doom is also meant to be one of the most O.P characters in the comics but yet he seems to drop down to the levels of the Fan 4 in the final battle which previously you saw him destroy anything in his path previously. -Whats the go with Tim Nelson being in this movie seriously can they stop regurgitating actors from previously failed ' marvel ' movies and maybe have a fresh start for some characters, especially for someone with a mediocre role as he had -Not really a huge issue but very disappointingly no after credits scenes which are signature to marvel based moves ( even though it is owned by FOX ) The only reason I have given it a 3 is the visual effects, only for one character though. The Thing looked insane compared to the 2005 version, only problem was due to the short length of the movie he got limited time and whipped out some really punishing quotes towards the end of the movie. Also I did like Franklin Storm in this film, he was a breathe of fresh air...but again wasn't perfected pulling out some pretty cheesy lines. So overall it was a total dud, no background characterisation on the characters, if there was it was limited and to go along with the short running time, it was hard to watch. Dialogue was just really, really average and I spent a lot of time watching the movie with my hands on my head in agony.",
         "Just because you can do it doesn't mean that you should \u2013 and this wholly unnecessary and woefully terrible reboot of Marvel's most famous superteam is proof of that axiom. Say what you may about Tim Story's earlier cinematic adaptations, but as generic and middling as they were, they were at the very least entertaining. Unfortunately, the same cannot even be said of Josh Trank's back-to- basics origin story, which plays like a humourless retread of his debut film 'Chronicle' but on a bigger budget \u2013 and lest there be any doubt, it is far, far from fantastic. Not that it doesn't demonstrate such promise; the first act which establishes the friendship between the visionary Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and his tough-guy longtime best pal Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) as well as the team dynamics between Reed and the other members of his research team \u2013 the equally brilliant Sue (Kate Mara), her hot- headed younger brother Johnny (Michael B. Jordan), and malcontent genius Victor Von Doom (Toby Kibbell) \u2013 capably lay the foundation for what could have been a character-driven drama based on their clashing personalities. Indeed, after the boys sans Sue decide on a whim following a night of intoxication to put their teleporting machine to the test, how they respond to their newfound super-powers individually and as a team should be an organic evolution from how they were before. Alas, Trank, who co-wrote the screenplay with 'X-Men' veteran Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater, doesn't quite know where to go from there. Rather than setting them on a course that would follow the perennial 'X-Men' theme of inclusiveness versus insularity against the rest of society, our teenage super-heroes are pretty much seen only in an isolated military facility where they are trained and from which they are deployed on covert operations overseas. While Johnny relishes the opportunity to be different, powerful and useful for once in his life, Sue and Ben are not quite so sanguine and participate insofar as there remains a possibility that the Government's research on them would yield some way of reversing their abnormalities. In the meantime, Reed has vanished off the grid, while Victor is presumed dead on the planet they had landed up on in the other dimension. One senses a conscious decision on the part of Trank to eschew the usual superheroics seen in the recent profusion of Marvel and to a lesser extent DC comic book adaptations, but the middle act drags precisely because Trank never quite finds a compelling substitute. Johnny's potential conflict with Sue and Ben over the Government's exploitation of their super-powers never amounts to anything more than a playground squabble. The estrangement between Johnny and his father (Reg E. Cathey), whose Baxter Institute had overseen the ill- fated project, is under-cooked. And last but not least, Reed's guilt over his teammates' fates as well as his strained friendship with Ben seem to vanish as quickly as he is apprehended and brought back to the facility to aid them in version 2.0 of the same project. Trank's intention of emphasising the tension within the quartet is evident and admirable, but is ultimately undone by a script that doesn't develop it in any substantive manner. Worse still, it leaves an audience looking for visual spectacle severely wanting, that not even a very busy third act manages to salvage. Doom makes an unsurprising return here as their common enemy, driven by a fusion of body and alien matter to cause global destruction and around whose defeat to ensure the survival of planet Earth becomes a rallying call for the team to unite despite their differences. It is one of the dullest and most unexciting finales we've seen in a Marvel movie, not least for the fact that it doesn't know how to collectively bring together their superpowers except in a tag-team fashion to distract their opponent. It is also on the whole one of the ugliest comic book movies we've ever seen. The planet from which the quartet gain their powers is a barren rocky wasteland that has no character or distinction whatsoever, shrouded perpetually with thick grey clouds and given the even more nondescript name of 'Zero'. The energy that gives them their abilities appears as some slimy green goo that belongs entirely in a C-grade Syfy TV movie, while their powers \u2013 whether Reed's rubber limbs or Sue's telekinesis or Johnny's pyrotechnics or Ben's rock-covered body \u2013 look equally cheesy. It is no wonder too that the eventual showdown, which takes place almost entirely on the planet surface of 'Zero', doesn't play out any much better against such a bland setting, coming off even worse than any of the action scenes in its predecessors. And certainly, this reboot is in no way better than Tim Story's earlier adaptations, no matter of its ambition of being a darker and more character-driven superhero piece. 'Chronicle' may have been a perfect calling card for Trank, but 'Fantastic Four' shows a young, inexperienced director completely out of his depth, absolutely justifying the advance bad buzz it had spent months battling. It is utterly embarrassing that a film about Marvel's most enduring creations is no better than a live-action 'Power Rangers' movie, but that's exactly the ignominy that this misconceived and badly executed excuse of a superhero movie has wrought. As is typical with such origin stories, this one ends with the quartet 'stumbling' on their title as they admire their new home in Central City and reflecting on how far they have come. Ben aka the Thing describes their journey as \"fantastic\"; we're not entirely sure anyone of their audience shares the same sentiment.",
         "I'm honestly not surprised one bit that I didn't enjoy this movie.The trailer was awful,and it was obvious the movie was only made for Fox to keep the rights to this piece of garbage. The main problem with this movie is that it tries so hard to be dark and gritty.The movie isn't gritty at all.Dark?Yes at some points,but not in a good way. Another problem with this abomination is it's pace.Oh my god,the pace of this movie is incredibly slow.I'm in disbelief I didn't fall asleep.Honestly,the films pace is so slow,it's hard to know what's going on at times due to how bored you are. Next is the acting.While I though young Miles Teller did decent,the other actors were awful.I honestly feel everyone,especially Kate Mara,was miscast.It seems to me as if every actor was bored,but hey so was the audience! Another problem is the villain.I don't have much to say about Doom,besides the fact that he was forced into the film for the sake of having a villain.He wasn't threatening for even a second;He was just a joke,like the film itself. Lastly,the film is a set up for films to come.It's obvious it is,so Fox can keep the rights.From rumors out there,it's trying to set up sequels,which is true,and it's trying to set itself up with the X-Men Franchise,which I hope not. Overall,the film was an atrocity,just like it's predecessors,and the only good thing was probably the CGI.Then again,it wasn't even that amazing.The CGI wasn't as good,as say,'The Amazing Spider-Man 2'or 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. My rating is a 2/10,and it'd be a 1/10 if the CGI was a tad bit worse.",
         "I went into this movie with hope and optimism and not put off by the negative light shone towards it. An hour and 40 minutes later, I left feeling empty and unsatisfied. Comic book films are supposed to make you feel inspired, but not this one. So what is wrong with it? One word \u2013 chemistry. In any superhero team/ensemble there should be great character interactions and a feeling that these guys can effectively make a team, never mind a ''fantastic'' team. The best team movies all have characters playing off each other as in the Avengers and X-Men. ¬†However, there is zero chemistry between any of the F4. We see an attempt at some early romance between Reed and Sue which doesn't go anywhere. Johnny Storm is billed as a genius but troubled kid however we never see why he has a high IQ, he is just shifted in to make up the numbers. We never see him form any sustainable bond with any of the others. Ben Grimm also appears as an outsider, brought in with little sense to the project to fill the final slot. The chemistry between the original F4 (2005) was MUCH better whereas here they feel like 4 individuals. ¬† The climatic battle takes place in the most boring environment that you can imagine. It is over within 10 minutes, with not much ingenuity to overcome a half decent attempt at Dr Doom, who at first seems very intimidating. This film will be quickly forgotten and the question isn't whether a sequel will be made or whether it will cross over with X-Men, but is the original Fantastic 4 film a better watch than this depressing, dull comic book movie. Final score 5.5/10",
         "I would like to start by saying no. Just no. Oh my gods No! Josh Trank, I assume your name is short for 'Tranquilizer', yes? I cannot think of a single thing that can save this film. Kate Mara, you are gorgeous and a wonderful actress and I admire your work and, most importantly, I hope this willfully awful thing has not destroyed your career. So: Script = No. Direction = No. Characters = No (which is odd, because the Fantastic Four are great characters, and yet you have managed to get a 'no' with them. Remarkable!). Miles Teller = No. Josh Trank = No. Even for cereal commercials, no. Recast the original Fantastic 4 movie and reboot THAT. What you have done is bad. I'm stunned. This was worse than Batman & Superman vs Storytelling, and you can read my review on that travesty on IMDb to learn just how badly you have done!",
         "The movie industry is making mistake after mistake. It started with the first Spiderman movie. Parker gets unmasked apparently just to selfishly show the actor's face. So they sacrifice the secret that only the audience or reader was supposed to know. His true identity! Then they really went off the deep end in Fantastic Four 2015. Trank was apparently PROUD he didn't follow the original comic book. For the next FF, I think it would be good if they made the entire cast black. They could also have Sue and Johnny have an incestuous relationship while making Reed and Ben gay. I'm sure that would pack 'em in! I seriously doubt I'll bother to go see another superhero movie. And I grew up with those comics. I used to get a kick out of them. But they've taken political correctness to the Nth degree and I'm not going to pay another dime to see any again. This review probably won't pass the political correctness test, but that's OK. Then the industry doesn't find out about their mistakes until they go belly up. They deserve to be out of business for cranking out this kind of trash.",
         "I wasn't expecting to enjoy this movie at all. I was a huge skeptic when the first trailer came out thinking it would be another FF movie chock full of cheesy one-liners and cartoony humor. In that respect, I was way off. Josh Trank's Fantastic Four is grounded in relative realism, showing what would likely happen if people did in fact crack inter-dimensional travel and brought back superpowers. It has a darker tone than the other movies and is a wildly different experience because of it. The characters are more relatable, their situations are more believable, and for a good part of the movie, it actually feels like you're watching the true Fantastic Four origin story unfold. I can't blame Trank for the discrepancies I have with the movie because he is not at fault. Apparently the producers demanded reshoots which rear their ugly head about 20 minutes from the end. It turns from this relatively dark, stylish superhero drama to an overblown one-liner infested CGI-fest. Mind you, I was still pulling for the heroes the entire time, but the moments following, preceding and including the final confrontation are so forcefully rushed and haphazardly put together it completely disconnects you from what the first hour of the movie set-up. The climax is generic and lackluster, and the believable shaky chemistry the characters shared in the beginning of the movie becomes incredibly forced and awkward. The shift is so drastic it's as if they Frankenstein'd two separate movies together, making for one extremely disjointed watching experience. Miles Teller and the rest of the cast have the benefit of being immensely likable. They worked well together and had palpable chemistry for a good chunk of the movie. Even Doom was fine. Once I got past the fact that it wasn't the comic book's adaptation of \"Doctor Doom\" and took him at face value as a sci-fi villain, I thought he worked wonders and actually posed a genuine threat to humanity. The CGI as a whole is great - a few moments will leave you scratching your head as in \"was that really necessary?\" but for the most part, the alternate dimension looks fantastic and the few fight scenes there are (literally only two or three) are executed well. Again, these are simply hints of what the movie could've been. It's obvious Trank had a vision with this world, and it's a damn shame that we won't be able to see it in full effect. What we're left with is a promising set-up and a complete mess of a third act with potential bleeding out right up until the final frames. Fantastic Four is more realistic and immersive than the other two adaptations, but unfortunately not as fun as either. What we're left with is an exercise in \"what could have been\" and another superhero movie with promising aspects that simply did not click.",
         "Fantastic Four is not your average superhero movie by today's standards. It's dark, low-key, and unexpected. I almost passed on watching this, since everyone seemed to have hated it. I'm glad I gave it a shot anyway. I'd like to borrow a quote from another reviewer here that expresses quite accurately why this movie didn't do well (even though the review was intended to be negative): \"Fantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I don't see audiences taking to this, at all.\" That about sums it up. Superhero audiences were expecting something similar to recent superhero offerings, and they didn't get it. For myself, being generally not terribly impressed with most recent superhero movies, I had a somewhat different reaction. There have been a couple standouts, like Batman Begins and Iron Man, but on the whole most seem like forgettable, disposable eye candy. If taken as a standalone flick, independent of any expectation, this is a decent movie. It's for the most part well-paced, well-acted, the effects are convincing without being overdone, and it's even well-written, for the most part. What it is not, is \"big\". And people were expecting big, of course. Rather than its characters shown becoming celebrities with the world watching, the press eating them up, and displaying spectacles for the public that destroy city property, these kids spin a rather \"small\" tale that occurs primarily in secret. I give this a seven out of ten, but threw in an extra star to offset (just a little bit) the unfair slap this movie got due to viewer tastes being, I feel, ruined by bloated Hollywood treatment of recent superhero adaptations.",
         "It is almost impossible to imagine that in 2015, as movie audiences experience the golden age of superhero movies that there can still be crap like this. Somehow, someway Fant4stic reaches into the depths of awful superhero movies, and takes the crown for being one of the worst superhero movies of all time. Lets start with the lack of story or even a simple plot. For starters, we really aren't even introduced to some resemblance of a plot until an hour into the movie, and even then the plot essentially boils down to Doom sucking a hole out of the earth to somehow build his own planet, which is completely bare. Considering that synopsis, I think it is almost safe to say that this movie doesn't even have a plot (or one that at least makes sense). OK so the movie doesn't have a \"genuine\" plot, that been the case with some other superhero movies. It should at least have some cool action scenes or provide some worthwhile visuals. Nope! I honestly can only recall maybe five minutes of some actual \"action\"' and even that was happening, it was absolute crap. There were multiple opportunities throughout the film to showcase their powers, especially in the scene with Reed Richards and Ben Grimm, but instead, all we are left with is crappy one-liners. Even in the last 10 minutes when we get the big battle, it ends up being a boring, uneventful, clich√©, and yes crappy letdown. So we've got no story, no action, no villain (I won't even waste my time with Dr. Dumb), how about some witty dialogue or a couple of humorous scenes. Wrong again. In its attempt to be the Dark Knight of FOX superhero movies, Fant4stic is stripped of all the humor and campiness that at least made the earlier Fantastic Four movies watchable. Instead, we get a dark and surprisingly depressing film that doesn't evoke any sense of emotion from the viewer except for boredom. The jokes are laughable (except there not) and just about all the interaction between characters feels forced and inauthentic. OK. So by now you get the idea. Fant4stic is an absolute crap-shoot of a movie. A movie void of a plot, action, and OK dialogue doesn't even deserve to be called by its name, hence the Fant4stic's. It makes the earlier Fantastic Four movies look like The Avengers, and in the end, serves as an embarrassment to anyone associated with the film. And if you were wondering, yes, it is even worse than Batman & Robin. :0",
         "Fantastic Four(2015) Starring: Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell, Toby Kebbell, Tim Blake Nelson, Reg E. Cathey, Chet Hanks, and Tim Heidecker Directed By: Josh Trank Review CHANGE IS COMING. When I was a little boy around the time when I saw Spider- Man the movie from 2002 I also watched the 90s cartoon of Spider-Man on Jetex. Along with two other Marvel properties The Incredible Hulk cartoon and Fantastic Four. I was a big fan of that show I haven't seen it in a long time. But when they made the 2005 movie and I saw the trailer on the official website of the movie I got excited, saw the movie and I loved it as a kid and I still do. The sequel however the only good thing I could say for it at the time was Laurence Fishburne. I mean I know it was kind of hard to make a fantastic four movie with Galactus but ugh I just couldn't fathom what they did to him. Comic book movies are booming these days and it's a damn shame that this is the most recent entire to Marvel's first family. I like the 2005 movie but it's doesn't feel as Fantastic as the cartoon did. I have three perfect Spider-Man movies, I have five perfect Batman movie, I have four perfect Superman movies, I have three perfect X- Men movies, I have at least one perfect Hulk movie. But not one for Marvel's first family. What the hell?! Four young outsiders teleport to a dangerous universe, which alters their physical form in shocking ways. Their lives irrevocably upended, the team must learn to harness their daunting new abilities and work together to save Earth from a former friend turned enemy. They use their origins from the Ultimate line of comics and you know something Kate Mara was actually going to read the comics to learn about her character but a FOX executive said \"No don't worry where going to use only the origin from the ultimate line, not any of the character aspect\" yeah actors who want to be in comic book movies if a studio executive says that to you get out of the project because they're not like Kevin Feige where they are a walking encyclopedia on Marvel or a person who gives a crap about the movie, if they don't care why should you. In this movie their is a scene where Reed Richards one of the smartest minds in the Marvel universe who while may take an obsession in his work abandons Ben, Sue, and Johnny in the facility where they are being kept. Reed would never do that especially to Sue or Ben! Victor Von Doom one of Marvels most feared and powerful villains looks like absolute crap! His character is absolutely horrible as well he's an emo punk who's a stalker for Sue. But the thing that really grinds about this movie is the one thing that they had in the Tim Story movies they completely ignored in this film, do you want to know what makes the Fantastic Four standout in the Marvel universe aside from their villains, forget their villains for a minute, the most important thing they forgot about the fantastic four is............. THEY ARE A FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SCREW THIS MOVIE,IT IS THE WORST COMIC BOOK MOVIE AND ADAPTION I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!!!!!",
         "'Fantastic Four' has always been a fun comic book. Ever since the early 60s, these four heroes have entertained us in each crime fighting, earth saving, and alien destroying issue. With Reed Richards, Johnny and Sue Storm, and Ben Grimm, there was nothing that these four couldn't handle. One of my favorite story arcs was from the mid-2000's where Ultimate Fantastic Four had to deal with zombies. It was an excellent storyline, one that I wish will be told on the big screen at some point. Speaking of the big screen, the Fantastic Four have never seen a good adaptation. There was a movie in 1994 made by Roger Corman (king of the B-Movies), which was never released. It was only made to secure rights for a friend, and is stuff of pure cinema legend and sought out by cult film fanatics. If you've seen any YouTube clips of it, you know it's terrible. Let's fast forward to 2005, where the guy who made the 'Barbershop' movies was given the opportunity to make a 'Fantastic Four' movie. If you can recall it, you'd remember it was awful and that Jessica Alba was really the only memorable thing from the movies, or at least the most talked about. 'Fantastic Four' is one of those Marvel properties that has yet to be turned over to Marvel itself, and is still owned by 20th Century Fox, which is unfortunate, because that studio still has no clue what it's doing with this franchise. That brings us up to date with 2015's 'Fantastic Four', which is a movie where nothing happens for 100 minutes. The studio hired Josh Trank to direct the film. Trank's only other credit was the \"found footage\" superhero film 'Chronicle' which had its good moments, but supposedly Trank is very difficult to work with, which is why he was booted off the upcoming 'Star Wars' film. Whatever good 'Chronicle' had going for it is non-existent here with 'Fantastic Four' and seems like it's one long set up for something yet to come. Over 95% of the film takes place inside a science lab where we see Reed Richards (Miles Teller) , Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), and Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) building a teleportation device and typing fast on a computer rather than using any powers or participating in an action sequence of any kind. Then there is Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell), who of course is Dr. Doom and is evil for really no real reason. Maybe he's angry because his name is Victor Von Doom. It's never really explained. For a movie that is really 100 minute of an origin story that is supposed to run deep with character development, we really learned nothing about any of the characters at all other than that Sue loves to listen to her iPod, Reed can type fast on a computer, Johnny likes to race 90's rice rockets, and that Grimm may or may not enjoy his new rock body. That is literally the character's story arcs. Sure they come together and travel thru their teleportation device to another dimension after one of the monkeys from 'Dawn of the Plant of the Apes' does, but that's about it. It's not until the final 45 seconds of the film where we see some fraction of a team forming. I get that this is the start of something new and a big origin set up for future films, but there has to be something at stake here and some sort of conflict. Unfortunately, there isn't, other than at the end of the movie, there is a small crater in a rural area.The only good moment of the film was seeing Dr. Doom show his sadistic and violent powers, but it was over way too quick and was met with some bad directing. Then there is a the issue of the script, which is just terrible. I've seen better dialogue the 'Sharknado' films than I did here with 'Fantastic Four'. Most of the movie is just someone shouting what's happening on screen and what they should do to fix it. It was cringe worthy, complete with Ben Grimm yelling his actions as he's executing it in full on Thing mode. This is a shame too, because there are some very talented actors here who aren't given anything good to work with. My advice is to wait a few more years until Fox gives up the rights to Marvel so that we get a real origin story to this great superhero team. AVOID THIS MOVIE!",
         "One thing I loved about the comic is the relationship they have with each other. Especially the back and forth between the Thing and Human Torch but there is no team interaction in this film whatsoever. On top of that Sue Storm isn't even with the group when they get their powers! In a time when technology is getting better and it's getting harder to tell when something is computer generated or not how does a blockbuster such as this get away with bad CG. Fant4stic could have addressed all of the previous complaints and would have still emerged as a pretty bad movie; above everything else, the biggest problem with the film is its story. Not just that it's poorly conceived and not fleshed out at all, but that it's told in such a lazy, haphazard way. There's the usual protracted pre-transformation set-up that's been mandatory since Batman Begins, which runs for the first half of the movie and falls flat thanks to the poorly written characters. Then bright lights happen, powers are given, heroes are captured and\u0085 we jump forward a year inexplicably. OK, so things are going to look at how they've changed in that time, right? Nope. All of a sudden the third act motivation \u2013 heralded by the return of Doom \u2013 appears out of nowhere and we're into a rushed final sequence where the heroes' first attempt to stop the destruction of Earth actually works. THE END. That's it. That is the most measured way to present Fant4stic's narrative. I'd say it was written for an audience with a severely short attention span, constantly mixing up the status quo just to make things appear vaguely interesting, but the short run time suggests key development points were actually edited out, leading to such incredibly choppy pacing. Again \u2013 an explanation, not an excuse. Fant4stic is barely a movie. It's a bunch of vaguely connected moments cobbled together to 100 minutes so it can qualify for a cinematic release; the idea there's a coherent narrative with a flowing story between its vaguely defined beginning and end is so contentious it's insulting.",
         "Fox, give the rights back to Marvel, and lets pretend this movie just never happened. Bad script Bad acting Bad characterization Bad Doctor Doom Bad action Bad effects Badly boring Bad Fox Studios This movie sucked so bad that I didn't even bother finishing it. Give me a break Fox, you can do better and we deserve it, because this makes two failed attempts now, and a third would just make the F4's chances of ever getting a good movie even worse. Give the rights back to Marvel. Yours sincerely A person with a brain and eyes"
