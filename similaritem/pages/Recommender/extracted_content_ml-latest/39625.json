         "\"A Genius, Two Friends, and an Idiot\" also titled \"Trinity Is Back Again\" is a Western satire with a bemusing premise , there is plenty of action in the movie , guaranteeing shootouts , fights or stunts every few minutes ; however , being regularly directed by Damiano Damiani . It's an improbable blending of standard Western , tongue-in-cheek , silly humor , Comic-book and realized in Spaghetti/Fagioli/Trinity(Terence Hill-Bud Spencer) style . It deals with an expert conman named Joe Thanks (Terence Hill) who remembers the character ¨Nobody¨ from ¨Il Mio Nome e Nessuno¨ or ¨My name is Nobody¨ by Tonino Valeri . Joe teams up with Mestizo Bill Locomotiva (Canadian singer , Robert Charlebois) and naive Lucy (Moiu Miou) to rob a lot of money from a nasty Army officer . Joe is a genius with several qualities as ubiquity , controlling space and time and fast gun . As three rogues set out to steal $300,000 from an Indian-hating cavalry major Cabot (miscast Patrick McGoohan) supported by his Sergeant Milton (Raimund Harmstorf) . Their elaborate scheme is full of disguises , treason , and pursuits , but Joe along with half-breed Steamengine Bill always seem to know what they are doing . The two gunmen using his wits , break all the rules and kicking virtually every cliché in the pants carry out their objectives . Spaghetti/Schnitzel/Paté Western parody co-produced by Italy/Germany/France , it is packed with ridiculous situations , noisy action , exaggerated roles and lots of silly humor .This is a surprisingly low-key Spaghetti Western in which three diverse characters joining forces to rob a cache of money . This amusing as well as absurd picture contains a funny plot , action Western , shootouts and bits of campy and embarrassing humor . During filming took place a distress , parts of the original camera negative were stolen , so the film makers had no choice but to assemble many scenes from alternate takes , until today the original negative has not been found It displays an entertaining screenplay written by usual Ernesto Gastaldi , but shot by a filmmaker with no sense of humor . Amiable but sometimes lumbering Western satire goes on and on about the same premise , as a lot of minutes are superfluous ,it has half hour of excess , as it packs overblown jokes and antics and some moments turns out to be dull and tiring . This overlong film mingles slapdash, silly scenes , chases , double-crosses and it's fast moving and embarrassing .There appears customary Spaghetti actors such as Benito Stefanelli , Mario Brega , Raimund Harmstorf , Reno Girone , Rik Battaglia , and of course Klaus Kinski . The musician Ennio Morricone , composes a jolly soundtrack with catching leitmotif and well conducted. Colorful cinematography plenty of barren outdoors , sunny landscapes under a glimmer sun , stunningly photographed by Giuseppe Ruzzolini on location in Monument Valley , Utah , a favorite place habitually used by John Ford and also Sergio Leone , here producer . This was a failed farewell in Western genre from Sergio Leone , and ordinary secondary actors as Mario Brega and Klaus Kinski as a grumpy gunfighter who is ridiculed by the genius Terence Hill . The motion picture was middlingly directed by Damiano Damiani and lavishly produced by Fulvio Morsella and Sergio Leone . Damiani's so-so direction is regularly crafted, here he's mostly cynical and humorous and less inclined toward violence and too much action especially on its ending part . Damiano is an expert on all kind of genres as Drama (¨Arthur's island¨ , ¨The Most Beautiful Wife\" , ¨The witch¨ , and ¨Empty canvas¨ based on the Alberto Moravia novel) , Terror (Amytiville 2 : the possession) , Historical (¨The Inquiry¨) , Spaghetti Western (¨Trinity is back again¨and the prestigious ¨A bullet for the General¨ again with Klaus Kinski) . Damiani was specialized on crime-thriller-Subgenre or Italian cop thriller (¨Confessions of a Police captain¨ , ¨How to kill a judge¨, ¨The case is closed , forget it¨, \"Goodbye e amen\" , ¨Mafia¨, \"I Am Afraid\" and ¨Warning¨ starred by Martin Balsam) . Rating : Average , 5 . Only for Terence Hill fans .",
         "Terence Hill has appeared as various characters in Spaghetti-Westerns, most of which are based on the \"Trinity\"-series, later fetched out into the \"Nobody\"- and \"Lucky Luke\"-characters. \"Nobody\" remains one of Hills most terrific (solo)-performances and it's no big surprise that this film was billed as a \"Nobody\"-sequel in many countries, despite Hill playing a completely different character, namely Joe Thanks, Trinity, not so much Nobody, in all but name. Let's talk about the acting first: Robert Charlebois as Joe Thanks semi-Indian sidekick seems an odd choice, yet, somehow the Canadian chansonaire somehow manage to pull the role off. Miou-Miou is cute like a button, Raimund Harmsdorff is a force of nature and Patrick McGoohans performance makes you feel like clapping. As in any movie he had starred in, Klaus Kinski steals the best part \u2013 albeit, his 'Doc Foster' disappears, virtually blue-balled, during the first ten minutes. This would remain one of the few Kinski appearances in a comedy and Werner Herzog didn't lie when he said, that Kinski had a very good sense of humour \u2013 just, many people don't know how to appreciate it. A word of warning here: many a great movie has been utterly destroyed by inept American dubbing: to mind come \"Das Boot\" or \"Christiane F \u2013 Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo\". \"A Genius, Two Friends and an Idiot\" fits into this mould, the (US)-English synchronization being completely unbearable. I personally recommend the German-dub version (I believe, Kinski speaks himself), which has the right balance between straight-faced and farce. For fans of the Bud Spencer/Terence Hill \"Trinity\"-Westerns and post-Bud Spencer Westerns, \"A Genius, Two Friends and an Idiot\" is a must-see.",
         "Bit of a disappointment this one, although it was always bound to be too good to be true. Just think of it! A spaghetti western directed by the great Damiano Damini (A Bullet for the General) and the greater Sergio Leoni, starring legendary actors Patrick McGoohan and Klaus Kinski, with music by Ennio Morriconne. How could it go wrong? Well let's start... The opening sequence at least (directed by Leone) is brilliant and promises a terrific film. A promise that is not kept. The sequence has little or no bearing on the rest of the film, an action comedy about the conning of a racist cavalry Major (McGoohan) out of three hundred thousand dollars and the love triangle between the three con-artists, led by Terence Hill. There seems to be something about most Italian comedy that simply doesn't work when playing to a British or American audience and here it is the same. Most of the film is buffoonery that falls flat, made increasingly worse by the decision to give most of the co-stars silly voices in the dubbing room. Klaus Kinski comes off the worst in his tiny cameo, looking great, out-acting everyone on the screen, but sounding like an ancient hillbilly. Miou-Miou's squeaky toddler voice is unbearable. McGoohan too sounds bizarre, somewhere between an English toff and WC Fields (all the stranger still, because the voice is actually his). The music tends towards the comical of course, and as such is not in Morricone's best work. However, there are some diamonds among the rough. McGoohan's performance is great, in spite of the voice.Terence Hill makes a fairly engaging lead, whose description of a duel is a classic moment for spaghetti westerns. The climax too, an energetic chase, accompanied to Morriconne's reworking of Beethoven's Fur Elise, ending with a tremendous explosion that leaves McGoohan covered in white dust atop his horse like an imposing alabaster statue (worth the admission price alone) is evidence that there is some real talent at work here. In a perfect world, A Genius would be the very best of the spaghetti westerns. As it stands, it is a failure that I'm very pleased to have seen.",
         "This popular latter-day Spaghetti Western proved a disappointment overall, considering the talents involved; to begin with, I've always been wary of semi-comic genre entries such as this \u0096 which stars one of its major exponents, Terence Hill (in fact, I recall having misgivings about even his MY NAME IS NOBODY [1973]): incidentally, that film was produced by the foremost director of Spaghetti Westerns \u0096 Sergio Leone \u0096 who was also involved with this one in an uncredited capacity (as a matter of fact, the striking and violent opening sequence is attributed to him!). Anyway, the film clearly owes a huge debt to Leone's THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (1966) \u0096 several genre outings, actually, tried to cash-in on that classic by devising (often amusing) variants on its title \u0096 though there are so many characters involved that it's hard to determine who the various epithets are referring to! The international cast, then, includes \u0096 besides Italian Hill \u0096 Irishman Patrick MacGoohan (though playing a U.S. Cavalry officer), French Miou-Miou and Robert Charlebois, and German Klaus Kinski (appearing in a bit early on as a gambler/gunslinger). Director Damiani had dabbled in the genre previously with one of the politically-oriented efforts, A BULLET FOR THE GENERAL (1967); the film under review, though, isn't nearly as stylish or engaging \u0096 also, as with a number of examples of its kind, it's overstretched for no real purpose! Another underwhelming element here is the score by \"Euro-Cult\" guru/genre stalwart Ennio Morricone \u0096 while pleasant in itself and occasionally inventive, it's decidedly forgettable in the long run: it seems he'd been doing it for so long that inspiration had pretty much withered by this time! There's not even that much action throughout the film: it's merely a collection of incidents which sees opportunistic Hill, gruff and dim-witted Charlebois (who's not only unhappy to be constantly reminded of his Indian heritage but he gets to negotiate terms with them over land rights while posing as a U.S. Colonel!), charming Miou-Miou, and shrewd villain MacGoohan (who's wasted here: what was he thinking?!) teaming up and/or double-crossing each other for possession of the proverbial booty (the plot, thin and all-too-typical \u0096 as can be surmised \u0096 is still separated by a good deal of padding). To be fair, the film is mildly enjoyable as such (a reasonable assessment for an outing emanating so late in the game) \u0096 but hardly unmissable as Spaghetti Westerns go\u0085",
         "I purchased this PAL DVD (my Macintosh computer plays the format) and a region- free, NTSC/PAL DVD player (connected to a regular NTSC tv) so I, NOT THE STUDIOS, can choose what I want. The PAL disc was the only version I found available, and I will submit DVD info when I find time. Look for the widescreen/ letterboxed format (which \"Genius\" is), instead of the horrid pan and scan, because letterboxed (or matted) is what the director intended viewers to see! Please keep an open mind about spaghetti westerns. Sometimes viewers comment with such harsh criticism that it can turn someone away when they should be prompted to look for a title in the genre they are interested in. I've suddenly grown a fascination in macaroni that I'm finding movies that I've never been interested in before. I swore on Clint/Eli/Cleef/ Leone/Ennio flicks yet didn't notice people like Nero and Milian. And now I'm discovering not to be so hard on my boy Terence Hill. Okay, so he doesn't take it so seriously. At first, that's what turned me away from his flicks. It wasn't Eastwood enough. But geez, what a kick you can get from \"Genious.\" Initially I didn't care for Ennio's music, but it seeps into you. And there's something about the camera placement and movements that draw me into the film, which was just the right length -- not too long or short. The funny moments and comments throughout, plus the explosion (a very real and powerful one) somewhere in the flick made me decide on 8 stars. I judge these the same way as kung fu action. It can be so easy to pick apart and be literal, but these generally are simply pasta and lo mein noodle- type movies. Just enjoy sucking it into your system. You'll love getting full, and soon you'll want another helping.",
         "Spaghetti Westerns are Clint Eastwood to the average dork like me. Apparently they also meant high camp comedy to many in Europe. The DVD information says this movie took more lira in Italy than 'The Good Bad and Ugly'. The comedy spaghetti was family fare apparently. What a flight of whimsical ideas this one turned out to be. The spaghetti western era ended with this one. An idea that had travelled so far that it had finally arrived backwards and inside-out. Very strange. Klaus Kinski gets dubbed out of earshot and Terence Hill has the voice of a girl with the blue-eyed, doe-eyed smile of an angel. No wonder Patrick McGoohan dug deep in his own character-filled pockets for an inspired way to project his cavalry h'Officer. Yes, he came up with the, possibly, historically accurate idea of a Thomas Meagher....\"I am an American\". He looks dreadfully sun burnt too. Location filming in Monument Valley did his Celtic skin no good at all. This movie can only be viewed as episodic, a series of set-pieces. I am sometimes annoyed by McGoohan's accents as they blur his diction and my enjoyment of his delivery. This time, his accent is SO inspired, SO unpredicted, why, it's Genius !!",
         "This should have been a great film, but after the superb intro (which I think is directed by Leone) the film pretty much falls out of your mind after seeing it. Whith Leone involved, I did expect a great film and the intro did meet my expectations but the rest of the film is quite poor. I am a big fan of spaghetti westerns but this film falls because it is so messy. It is a ripoff from \"My Name is Nobody\" and \"Trinity\", with some more serious elements (such as the intro), paired together with a scrappy plot. I am not a big fan of Terrence Hill and this movie did not make me change my mind about him. The character he plays in this movie is pretty much a copy of the one he played in \"My Name is Nobody\" except the fact that he did a good job in that movie. He is not bad, but his acting gets boring (maybe he was tired of playing the same role in every film?). Klaus Kinski is good as always. The film does look great though, and does not have that b-film feeling to it like so many other spaghetti westerns. I don't hate this movie, but it did not meet my high expectations. Watching it without expectations, I can imagine that this flick works as great entertainment for the spaghetti western fan. And remember, the score by Morricone, the intro and the performance of Kinski are reasons alone to watch this movie.",
         "Not as obviously or patently a Sergio Leone movie as MY NAME IS NOBODY from a few years earlier but still as Leonesque as a movie can possibly be while still playing ball in Enzo Barboni's slapstick turf (quite possibly the worst spaghetti western niche), this RAFRAN produced movie is heavily flawed but eminently watchable even when it doesn't make a lick of sense. Leone being Leone, he had to stick in his hand, even in a movie in which he had no creative stakes (unlike My Name is Nobody). The opening scene is a masterclass in directing as one would expect from a master cinematician even if it amounts to little more than moody silence and gliding tracking shots. Those who appreciated the slow-burn dynamics of ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, will be spellbound for the duration. It's a fantastic opening to a movie that never quite capitalizes on it. The script is mired in inconsequential distractions and tacky \"end of the West\" commentary delivered without an ounce of subtlety (\"the old man will go away\", says Hill about an old Indian chief in the end as the rest of his Indian band prepare to take off without him dressed in fancy clothes and hats, \"he represents the old West\" #%^!) and the goofy hijinks Terence Hill became known for do the movie little favour but every now and then director Damiano Damiani comes up with a scene or a setup that impresses with its visual splendor. The Carlo Simi-designed sets, the beautiful locations in John Ford's turf in Monument Valley, and the technical skill involved in front and behind the camera (not Ennio Morricone's score though, which is far from his best work), are all far better than 95% of spaghetti westerns could ever afford, then or a decade before, so this should still be of some interest to the hardened spaghetti aficionado. Traditional Ford/Hawks loyalists should keep their distance though.",
         "A bizarre comedy/western hybrid with star Terence Hill, who, with his usual partner Bud Spencer, was one of Italy's brightest stars back in the late '60s/'70s. Here, Hill goes it alone with this many-titled movie which rips-off the work of Sergio Leone at numerous points but still succeeds in being a unique little movie, mainly through the cross between silly jokes and slapstick humour and more action-orientated, old-fashioned western behaviour. While not an entirely successful movie, A GENIUS, TWO PARTNERS AND A DUPE moves fast, has a plot to keep your head spinning and is occasionally brilliant. Things start off as they mean to go on with that most clichéd of western traditions: the duel. Here, Hill's opponent is the inimitable Klaus Kinski who plays Doc Foster, a devious card-player with murder on his mind. Incredibly, Hill's gun flies out of his pocket to shoot Kinski's gun from his head, which gives you some idea of the surrealist humour to expect in this movie. After this initial set-up, which doesn't bear much relevance to the rest of the film other than to play with Leone's conventions and introduce the cocky, joking Hill, the complex plot begins. What happens is far too detailed to go into here, and I would be lying if I said that I was fully following what was going on throughout. Basically it involves Hill and his cohorts trying to outwit Patrick McGoohan's Major Cabot, who in turn is trying to outwit them. Along the way a tribe of western-dressed Indians, that old staple of the Great Western-Pacific Railway and numerous minor characters get involved. Like Leone, director Damiano Damiani plays with the camera at points, dwelling on moments of silence in some instances and going over the top with others. Ennio Morricone's score is a great asset, as it plays with many classical music pieces as a counterpoint to the on screen action. My favourite parts of the film were all at the end, with various characters chasing each other in a very old-fashioned way. Some of these scenes are hilarious, like when Hill and some chasing guards hurdle over a number of barriers while a Beethoven riff plays over the action. It has to be seen to be believed. The characterisation is also strong in the leading characters, who have a touch of THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY about them in that generally they all hate each other and spend the movie fighting amongst themselves. Hill's smug presence takes some getting used to but he fits the bill well, and has enough charisma to carry it off; Charlebois is good as the gruff drunk caught up and lost amid the craziness, and the bizarrely named Miou-Miou is perfect as the token female. McGoohan gives a memorable performance and has one of the most amusing voices ever, whilst the supporting cast flesh out their roles with effectiveness. Allover, not a great film, certainly not up there with the Leone westerns, but more of a fun take on them instead. While I may not have enjoyed all of the movie, Damiani's direction is at times inspired and deserves some credit. I'm sure that in time I'll get to see more of these Italian comedy/westerns and perhaps find out what they're all about.",
         "I'd never heard of this one until I stumbled across it on DVD (under the title 'A Genius, Two Partners And A Dupe'). I was intrigued because it was directed by Damiano Damiani who made one of the very best non-Leone spaghetti westerns 'A Bullet For The General', and was produced (and many say co-directed) by Sergio Leone himself. I believe this was the last western Leone was involved with, and one of the very last spaghetti westerns ever made. The eclectic cast was another attraction. Terence \"My Name Is Nobody\" Hill, Miou-Miou, Patrick \"The Prisoner\" McGoohan and the legendary Klaus Kinski... Mmmm, very interesting! Well after sitting through this crap I now know why it's so obscure. It sucks. In almost every way. I have no idea of Leone's involvement, but the striking opening sequence looks like it might have been directed by him. Too bad it's all downhill from there! This was retitled to try and sell it as a sequel to 'My Name Is Nobody'. Hill actually plays a different character and the connection between the two is tenuous at best. BUT it is in a similar vein to many of Hill's comedy westerns, or should I say \"so-called comedy\" westerns? I didn't get one laugh out of it. It's really hard to imagine a serious director like Damiani making slapstick rubbish like this. The awful dubbing doesn't help things either. Regarding the supporting cast, the bad news is Kinski. He only had a small role in 'A Bullet For The General', but in this one it's even less. Basically Kinski has a two scene cameo at the beginning of the movie, and that's it. I love watching Kinski but anyone renting this movie just to see him should be warned. The good news is McGoohan. He has a much more substantial role and is quite good. Unfortunately he's surrounded by actors hamming it up and a lousy script. If the movie hadn't have played it for laughs, had someone other than Hill as the star (say Franco Nero) and more Kinski it might have been good. As it is only rabid Leone fans will want to bother watching it. Easily the poorest spaghetti western I've ever seen. Avoid.",
         "Despite the presence of Patrick McGoohan, and an interesting Ennio Morricone soundtrack, \"A Genius, Two Partners, and a Dupe\", comes across as more silly than entertaining. You get the usual Terence Hill antics, along with a story that is choppy and confusing. The film is presented as a series of incidents that do very little to advance the somewhat obscure tale they are trying to tell. The whole thing just meanders along for almost two hours, in other words going nowhere. This is not one of the better \"spaghetti westerns\" and except for the presence of the always fascinating McGoohan, and an all too brief appearance by Klaus Kinski, the movie would be completely forgettable. - MERK",
         "This Terence Hill film is quite strange!Supposed to be a sequel to My Name Is Nobody,it's a spoof on the old west!Not very family friendly,it has it's good parts!Terence Hill really makes the movie.It would have been better if his partner Bud Spencer starred with him.The first scene is directed by the great Sergio Leone.What's wrong with it is not the plot(a great plot),but the supporting cast,and how it doesn't make much of an impact,like My Name Is Nobody did so well.Great music from Ennio Morricone,though not very western sounding.In the end,Sergio Leone,was not impressed and took his name off the film and never did another western!",
         "While many people claim that \"A Genius, Two Partners, and a Dupe\" is a sequel to \"My Name Is Nobody\", it really isn't - Terence Hill's character here has a different name, and it's taking place before the events of MNIN. Sequel or not, what we have here is a very disappointing spaghetti western, one of the last that was made. For the longest time, there simply isn't any plot to be found. And when the plot DOES start, it unfolds in a very confusing manner. Klaus Kinski fans will be let down by the fact that he only appears for a few minutes. (He only seems to be in the film enough so that the movie could get German funding - the movie is an Italian, French, and German co-production.) Terence Hill is charming as ever, there is a great score by Ennio Morricone, and the scenery is fantastic, so the movie isn't a complete loss. Still, I would only recommend this to spaghetti western enthusiasts - and even they might find this tough to sit through."
