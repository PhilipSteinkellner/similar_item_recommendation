Tell the wrong joke in Singapore or United Arab Emirates and risk being handcuffed before you ever leave the stage. Bring Achmed the Dead Terrorist on stage in Malaysia after a government warning forbidding his presence, and you may begin an indefinite vacation in Kuala Lumpur. While Dunham collects and crafts pop culture references that can excite a local audience upon entering each country - Achmed on this trepidation of returning to the Middle East, Walter's (lack of) understanding of current race relations in South Africa, Bubba J. finding kindred spirits in Australia - Jeff shows that humor is truly universal.

Found myself imagining the rest of Ireland and Israel show, it must have been funny as hell! Jeff's jokes were just perfect, he really studied some of the countries bads&goods for the jokes, Achmed in Abu Dhabi its just fun to think about. Reaction from public in Israel is perfect, and in Ireland is amazing, those guys know how to laugh and get the jokes without getting mad. Ohh well, all in all, its a pretty good compilation, i just hope they release Ireland or Israel complete show for us mortals."],
