         "As an Alaskan, I consider this movie a comedy. I could have given it a 10 for that, but the intent was a documentary, therefore, I gave it a low rating. What I find odd is that most documentaries have actual interviews, but this one, used cut and paste of selected dialogue from people who were close to Mrs. Palin. I did not see a good sampling of people on the streets or people who worked with Mrs. Palin who were not part of her buddies. She hired most of her staff from her friends in Wasilla and/or people who were referred by her friends, not in an open way that most employers do. She hired \"yes,maam\" people, and these are the only ones who are depicted in this film. The person she hired to run the controversial dairy whose only qualification was she \"liked cows\" is a sampling of Mrs. Palin's CEO abilities. The movie doesn't give the facts about her mayor-ship of Wasilla; she hired a city manager (city of 5,000 population at the time of her election) because she didn't know what to do. She left the city of Wasilla in 21 million dollar debt, whereas before her \"CEO\" endeavors there was zero debt. Oh, and when the fast growing city needed infrastructure like sewer and water, she built a hockey stadium, and named it after a high school boyfriend. The way the movie was put together was so insulting to anyone's intelligence, that it had to be a comedy.",
         "With all the glowing reviews you'd think this film would have a rating over 8, instead of the dismal 1.6 reflective of some of the worst films ever made. This means the people who loved it (or love Sarah Palin) took the time to write a review, while the vast majority who thought it was complete garbage didn't bother. There is only one conclusion one could extrapolate from this: Palin supporters are a dedicated, but very much in the minority. I don't think this was the worst film ever made, but let's be clear that this was a fluff piece for the main subject. Politically it's no more nor less one-sided than a Michael Moore doc, but at least Michael Moore brings awareness to a particular subject of topical interest rather than simply shameless self-promotion. Even as a bit of propaganda, The Undefeated is heavy-handed, too long, unsubtle, and lacks an engaging narrative structure. I noticed that most of the positive reviewers also had never reviewed another film besides this one, suggesting they created a profile just to promote The Undefeated. If you're huge fan of Palin, have $10-15 to burn, and want to spend 2 hours hearing about how wicked her detractors are and how awesome she is, then this documentary might be for you. Or you could just read some of the glowing 'reviews' here and get the gist of the type of person who would love it. Personally, I wish I had accidentally walked into the wrong theater and saw Captain America instead.",
         "The trouble with Sarah Palin is most of us have already made up our minds about her and for the most part negatively. If Stanley Kubrick directed a positive film about her, and threw in all the spaceships, monkeys, atomic blasts and Alex's he could muster, we'd hate it still. We come to this film seeking comedy or horror. And Stephen Bannon is no Stanley Kubrick. Bit of background. I'm an American living in Barcelona. The Europeans I've spoken about her with, those who've been paying any attention, either loathe her or are genuinely puzzled by her ascension. Bearing that in mind, a Catalan friend obtained a copy through some interwebz magic and invited myself and girlfriend to watch. From the opening the room was filled with laughter. They were likely relying more on the subs and may have experienced a very different film from myself but our reactions were the same. Laughter, then boredom. A few more snickers then everyone turned their attention away from the screen and to the wine and the company. Long story short, it was a campaign ad. A very, very long ad that only those smitten by Palin will likely watch.",
         "This is so unspeakably dreadful, by my own assessment I should say no more. This is not a movie. It's an infomercial and like most infomercials it is riddled with omissions, exaggerations and downright lies. From the erroneous title -- she was defeated twice, once in the Alaskan primary for lieutenant governor and, of course, as John McCain's running mate, through the over-the-top, ridiculous imagery of lions eating zebras, boxers, etc. and let us not forget the mushroom cloud, it would be a total embarrassment to anyone with the brains to know what embarrassment is. I might have given it one point more if finally someone had told us the real reason the woman quit as governor.",
         "It is too bad that, given the way Palin was sprung on the American people, that this movie is so entirely biased. A true look at all sides of her record would be enlightening and helpful. Instead we get an amateurish, poorly recorded, one-sided diatribe that does nothing more than blow smoke. The subject (Palin) aside, this is a deeply bad movie--poorly written, scored, filmed, put together. Worse than some high-school projects or even you-tube videos. The images of the animal attacks that accompany and/or follow some star's critiques of Palin are laughable. Obviously the director/writer has seen & taken notes from Leni Riefenstahl and her propaganda films. Tell a falsehood over & over, make the subject look pretty & facts no longer matter. SAVE your money! and your brain cells!",
         "Probably the most atrociously bad lie filled love fest ever put on film. I love the paid posters on here trying desperately to raise the star rating on this steaming pile of Alaskan excrement. This schlockumentary is filled with the incoherent ramblings of friends and the paid punditry who drool over Simple Sarah's failed bid at VP and revel in the intelligence of her quitting her elected position because it was just too hard (but I guess VP would be easier). This opened to almost empty houses and I can see why. Nothing in this film is accurate in the least, filled with lies and misinformation of the forgettable political career of a severely despised, vengeful, spiteful, petty, and unintelligent woman. Who goes to see a documentary about them self? Simple Sarah Paycheck, that's who.",
         "I want to first off make it clear that I have no political axe to grind here. As far as I am concerned both the Dems AND Repubs are equally useless. That said, I want you to know that I review this \"film\" on it's merits as a documentary and not in critique of the (admittedly weird) political content. This film was a hodgepodge of sound bites and glowing testimonials to the power of Sarah Palin, nothing more. There was very little in the way of followable narrative, and any and all opposing viewpoints where hissed upon as some kind of shadowy conspiracy from \"the left\" to destroy what they see as their biggest threat. It felt more like a dumbed down version of \"Triumph of the Will\" to me. And like Leni Riefenstahl's classic film, it left me with a sense of dread in knowing that so many people can be so easily swayed by melodramatic notions of patriotism and willful demagoguery. And at least Riefenstahl could work a camera in a manner that didn't look like she was about to have an epileptic fit. The camera work in some of the interview portions makes it seem like someone is tickling the camera person. This may have been an attempt at making the scene look more \"urgent\" or \"home brewed\" I don't know, but it came across like someone skimmed through \"An Idioit's Guide to Cutting Edge Documentary Filmmaking\" the night before and didn't quite get it. If Palin truly had aspirations for some form of national higher office, I really feel that she may have blown it by allowing this stinker to be released. It's a real shame too, because the US really needs a shakeup in it's political system. If you are a fan of Sarah Palin, do not watch this film as it may leave a bad taste in your mouth due to it's transparent attempt at being an extended infomercial.",
         "The cutting in this is so frenzied! If any talking head is on the screen for more than literally (literally!) 2 seconds they're applying a quick succession of different color filters, extreme zooming, jump panning, etc. The talking head intro text is presented only once per head and so briefly that if you aren't Evelyn Wood on speed you'll almost certainly miss their name, position, or both. Why don't they properly introduce these obscure people who are yakking my ear off for almost two hours? Youth wants to know. I had to close my eyes to the visual cacophony in order to keep from hurling, and to actually be able to listen to what those heads were saying - which was very little beyond an incoherent presentation of universal love for their unjustly and inexplicably persecuted Sarah, on top of a continuous wash of super annoying and pointless background music. Did they watch the final cut and think to themselves that it needed something more to mask their largely bankrupt presentation? I learned almost nothing from the two hours, it could have easily been cut down to an hour (or less) without losing any info whatsoever. They played very fast and loose with stock and manufactured footage e.g. the close-up of the screaming angry mob was obviously staged. You really need to label the fake stuff in a purported documentary if you want to be taken seriously. The movie starts by showing us all the scary liberals who were frightened to death Sarah would get in and what big meanies they were (hey, she's a public persona who seems to enjoy the spotlight). This sets the quite defensive seeming tone for the entire movie, to the point where it almost completely subsumes the puff angle. Even if the central figure was a total stranger, I'd have to wonder why everyone (except for a handful of relatively unknown talking heads) was so terribly against everything she did and what she represented. Anyway, on to shots of oil soaked animal carcases from the Exxon Valdez tragedy with voice over from Sarah talking about what at tragedy it was. Shortly after this we hear how she championed - and got the public to pay for - yet more drilling and pipelines, there's environmental activism for you! But the state running a dairy farm is big government running amok so she had to close it down? She got a ton of big box stores to open locations in Wasilla, but she's for the little guy? That must have destroyed their local downtown economy. I find it incredibly ironic that the producers of this apparently tried unsuccessfully to adopt many of Michael Moore's methods to elicit outrage, given all the glowing reviews here of people who hate MM. This movie is likely the very best the big money lackeys, grifters, and hangers-on can crank out - they're either talentless hacks or their hearts just aren't in it (or both I suppose). Watch \"Going Upriver\" for an example this genre done right.",
         "While being a minority; most grassroots conservative tea party members generally love this movie, while the majority of folks' really dislike this film. While, I'm not for any political party, I can understand why, the majority hate it. The movie doesn't feel like a documentary. While Sarah Palin and her team were not part of the production; the film looks and reads like an infomercial. It's no surprised, that the movie was release, a year, before the presidential election of 2012. It felt like a one-sided campaign ad that was trying to put Sarah Palin, back in the limelight. In hope, that the public would demand her, to seek office. This documentary kinda flew under the political radar. I don't know, many people that came to see this movie when it came out. It's very questionable, why director Stephen K. Bannon chose this title for the name of his film; because it's pretty clear, that Sarah Palin was defeated, pretty badly. Not only did she lost the vice presidency in 2009, she quit the governorship of Alaska and as of this writing, never try, ran for public office, again. Bannon's originally choice for a title, 'Take a Stand' is more logically, but also makes no sense. While, she's still a strong polarizing public figure that speaks out, once in a while, she's doesn't have the political mindset that she had before 2008. Sarah Palin of the present day, is more focus on raising her family, and trying to maintain her outdoors themed reality television. That's not leadership at all. That's call; taking your ball and going home. Another thing, that the movie's fails to do, is be very informative. Yes, it show her rise from house-mom, to mayor, and then her tenure as Governor of Alaska, and her time spent as John McCain's running mate in 2008's presidential election, but the film approached her career, as if, filming a hagiography worthy of sainthood. While, the film does good, showing her strengths, the film really gloss over, most of her political faults. A good documentary is supposed to show a more realistic, complex showing of its subject matter. Instead, this film really tries to romanticize Palin, by having interviews with people who currently work for Palin, or have in the past, has been friends with her. All they talk about, is her achievements, while omitting her faults. While, it's great that the documentary point out some misunderstood facts about her past; the documentary's information is really felt one-sided and preachy. That isn't informative, at all. The film needed to be, a little more well-round; rather than showing a one-sided biased approach. The movie used some, really odd imagery at well. Images of animals attack, atomic warfare, knights, seem very out-there, and isn't grounded in any sense of reality. I don't know what most of them, were supposed to evocative. It felt more like a clusterf*ck mess. A good example is the slavery song, in the beginning. It's beautiful, but it doesn't match up, with the imagery of Sarah Palin, growing up. Unless, Palin's herself, feels like she was a slave, most of her life, which I really doubt. The film is constructed in three acts: Act 1: the servant's heart, Act 2: Mrs. Palin goes to Juneau, Act 3: Present at the Creation. All of the film's acts, have title cards, that start in an eerily way. A dark, snowy image, follow up, with haunting music. It felt like a start of a horror movie! It gets more jarring, as the first act feels like a tourism brochure with the interviewers ramblings incoherent more about their own Alaskan's life, rather than Palin. The second act is the only part in the documentary that seem focus on Palin. The third act, felt like a mindless rant from the director, using Sarah Palin as a figurehead, to fight a made-up, spiritual holy war, against the main stream media. It was kinda disturbing. I didn't like how the movie made her detractors seem like evil one-dimensional cartoony caricatures, out to destroy the world. This biblical cartoonish version of real life is just as bad, as the caricatured parodies of Palin. Not only does the third act, whitewash history, but it scapegoating all the blame of the presidential failure to the other parties. Another thing, that I didn't like, is how the movie often views, any criticism of Palin, as discrimination. Yes, some of these criticism are a bit sexism or misogyny and yes, I kinda agree that some critics of her, went a little overboard, with the shame calling and callousness threats. Still, I don't agree that, Sarah Palin is, without any criticism. Sarah Palin does have extremely hypocritical political views. She claims to be a conservative, but rarely show some. The movie claims that she stood up against Big Oil after the Exxon Valdez oil tragedy, but she rarely shows any environmental activism. Her advocacy of oil exploration and development including drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the de-listing of the polar bear as an endangered species is pretty alarming. Another thing, the movie claim to be for small business, but she got corporations to open locations in Wasilla. How is that, for the little guy? That must have destroyed their local downtown economy. The movie likes to compare her to Ronald Reagan, but I really don't see it. During her campaign to become vice president, a lot of things, came under close media scrutiny, particularly with regard to her religious perspective on public life, her socially conservative views, and her perceived lack of experience in foreign and domestic politics. Ronald Reagan was at least, a little more season. Overall: Not to be confused with 2011's sport documentary with the same name, The Undefeated is a niche documentary only good for Sarah Palin's supporters. To everybody else, it's way too heavy-handed to be taken serious. Don't watch, unless you're a huge fan of her work.",
         "I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated the information on Gov. Palin. The commentary by friends and co-workers was very enlightening and helped to reinforce some of the impressions that I already had. But the Production was just AWFUL. The director or producer, for some reason, felt that they had to insert video scenes of really odd stuff to reinforce what was being said. Things like lions eating their prey, or a plant bud rising out of a the soil. Just a lot of stupid stuff. Its like the director felt that we could not understand the oral information that was being provided so they provided dramatically graphical images. It was so annoying that I think the show would be much better with the picture turned off and done in audio only. I am a big supporter and big fan of Gov. Palin and I could hardly watch it. If this movie was to support her I think it probably had the opposite effect."
