         "There are great movies that give your emotions a hard kick in the butt, this movie gave mine a shotgun blast to the face. Home makes you stand up and confront something that most people make a conscious effort ignore. It was able to change my perspective on a problem that I and almost everyone I know overlooks on a daily basis. The viewer is given no choice but to look at life through the eyes of a disease that is terribly discriminated on. The acting is superb, the dialogue intriguing, and the setting...our backyard. This movie left me feeling more satisfied than I know how to explain in words. You will laugh in self defense.",
         "Home is an incredible portrayal of the stigma surrounding individuals suffering from mental illness. As someone who is interested in working in mental health nursing, I found this movie to be truly insightful in regards to the daily struggle of living with a mental illness. Despite the constant barriers faced by the main character, his resilience is remarkable, and is something I feel that is underestimated among individuals suffering from mental illness. This movie has further inspired me to pursue working in mental health, and I strongly believe that this is a must-see.",
         "Tonight we discovered this movie on Netflix. It is an excellent movie, perhaps more so because it is an independent film. Jono Oliver does a great job directing this film. The scenes are set a nice pace. It seemed less like a movie and more like we were watching the actual events of a man's life. Gbenga Akinnagbe does an excellent job in his role. This is a movie that had us talking afterward. I think this is something that everyone should give a shot. As a father myself, I could not imagine having to go through all the things this man does...just to be able to get a chance to spend some time with his son. I admired the main character's tenacity.",
         "This film has been at about 40 film festivals and the director got nominated for the NAACP Image award. It's the most realistic movie out there about mental illness I've seen since Cuckoo's Nest. The performances are outstanding. The characters are so real. The cast really captures the mental health issues that have impacted our society. The story is touching and pulls you into the world of Jack and his fellow consumers from the begging. Victor William stole the scenes that he was in, hands down! The ensemble was so well cast and they worked with each other so wonderfully. My favorite scene was with Theo Stockman. He deserves an Oscar for his performance. Go see this film!!!"
