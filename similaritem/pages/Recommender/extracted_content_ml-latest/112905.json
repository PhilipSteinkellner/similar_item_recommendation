         "Director Mr. Sanjay Leela Bhansali ,is known for taking the scenes far more ahead from screenplay by adding visual magic and he succeeds to create the magic again. He is also master of portraying emotions but this movie lacks his masterstroke. Story is simple, screenplay is OK but dialogues by Siddharth-Garima , are very good mostly. Movie is slow at places even belonging to the action drama romantic genre. Climax is forced because of adaptation. Love scenes are best as usual. Director has given his 200% to conceiving the visuals that he couldn't give his 100% to the emotions. Characters are not well established. A women, who is able to remove bullet from her most loved one person's dead body, possess soft heart!! How!? A person goes to the deadly enemy's house without proper disguise or any other precautions. Even , he can intrude with the help of a tree trunk.Guns are the most common things between them but in pre climax they fight with swords! Main male lead body is deliberately over exposed, which doesn't go well with the premise of the movie, where rest of the person prefers to cover themselves. Performance wise Ranveer Singh is OK but lacks in most of the emotional scenes. Deepika Padukone is adorable. He slaves you to look at herself in every frame. Ratna Pathak is impressive. Richa Chaddha is fine. Music by director himself is OK but lyrics by Siddharth-Garima is very good.",
         "Disappointing is the word with which I would like to start this review. When you know it's Romeo and Juliet, when you have seen Isaq and Isaqzaade you don't expect any thing exceptional from another movie with more or less the concept,plot and story. But when you see the name of Sanjay Leela Bhansali somewhere in your mind you feel may be this could be something different. At least the chemistry between the lead will be worth watching.And that's where, for me,the movie fails miserably. Chemistry is not just about the physical intimacy, it can be felt even when the leads are not sharing the same vicinity, like in the \"Lunchbox\". May be I was expecting love but there was only lust with lame dialogs. The couple seem to be desperate to get laid and hardly want to know each other. Apart from that there is unnecessary violence. There is nothing in the story which can keep you engage towards the screen. Enough of visuals, arts, huge sets and beautiful lass from SLB, its high time to incorporate story, original screenplay in your movie agenda. Even the visuals and set reminds you of some of his work done in the past. Please take some risk, get something new like you did in Khamoshi rather than being of the safe side with gimmicks, item number and cheap dialogs. The cinema is changing and its changing for good! Hope you be a part of that change soon.",
         "what a pathetic portrayal of an age old story. the movie rides on Deepika Padukone's skin show with excessive use of colour which could irritate one to the core.There is nothing in the movie which could keep the viewer hooked. Abhimanyu singh's talent is totally wasted, wish he had got more screen time. I personally like movies with violence, but Raam-leela is full of mindless, stupid violence. Must say that violence is not Bhansalis cup of tea.When everything was seen falling apart, there came the final nail in the coffin, Priyankas awful item number. Ranveer is okay, after all the hype much more was expected from him. The only saving grace of the film is Supriya Pathak who pulls off a difficult character with panache.",
         "The film starts on Bhansali sets where there are lot of guns. A riot occurs between two groups of people in bhansali sets. Meanwhile Ranveer is introduced by Tattad Tattad song on another Bhansali sets. He has the facial look of Bhansali himself but the lower body is shaved like Salman of 90s. May be Bhansali always had a fetish for that kind of appearance. Then Supriya Pathak who is member of one of the groups is introduced on yet another Bhansali sets. She continues her Khichdi act from where she had left. In next scene, it is revealed that Ranvir is a porn film seller. and just after that the Slutty Savitri Deepika is introduced, this is not a co-incidence�..and yes, on yet another Bhansali set. She plays a Gujju but has accent of a vernacular Marathi. Its Holi so a song starts and Deepika has started doing what she did in BKB, LAK, Cockail, KCK, Yjhd, Lafangey Parindey, i.e. hititng on the hero in the first mulaqat. They are about to have sex too with the underlying idea that \"Mor Apne Pankh Kholte Hain, Hum Kapde Kholte Hain\". But as we know by now, having watched those Deepika films, she never gives the \"happy ending\". So not much happens except that at least this time she didn't shy from kissing without shitting in her panties unlike BAH and YJHD. Ecstatic and erect, Ranveer falls in a pond of water created in Bhansali's sets. Then in the next set and scene, they are talking to each other rhyming words with the standards that can compete with the lyrics of Friday by Rebecca Black. Then there's the cheesiest of all dialogues � Deepika \"Jigar Pe Mat Ja, Trigger Daba Doongi\". Ranveer says \"Daba Na\". She replies \"Chee\". Jab Chee Hi Bolna Tha to Trigger Dabane Ki Baat Kari Hi Kyun? Trigger Dabana Hai To Daba Daal Warna Uski Baat Mat Kar. Either be complete slutty or complete Savitri. But then its Deepika Padukone. From here on this is Ishaqzaade Part 2 in Bhansali's sets. Ishqiya Dhishkiyaon song choreography reminds of Govinda-Karishma c-graders. The Police raid scene where police guy exchanges porn DVD with bullets is WTF. Ranveer kills Deepika's brother but lust wins over family bonding and now Deepika is desperate to marry Ranver otherwise \"Dono Ek Hi Kamre Mein Kaise Reh Sakte Hain\". Then after some more Ishaqzaade in Bhansali sets which can be fast forwarded if you are on torrent there is an Indra the Tiger type OTT sword fight scene of Ranveer. Then some more fast forward reveals that the end scene is also same as Ishaqzaade.",
         "To begin with RAM-LEELA remains another self-obsessed, colourful but over-stuffed painting on the celluloid with some exceptional brush strokes failing to generate any huge impact on the viewer in totality. The film does have its worth watching moments which are mostly to be found in its first half watching the lead pair together doing their lusty sexual acts (questionably) portrayed as Eternal LOVE. But post intermission it all fizzles out drastically and the director tries to add too many unconvincing twists and turns taking it to an unnerving end sadly. No doubt few magical moments do come in at various intervals, consolidating the director's famous status in the industry. But regrettably they are not something fresh or path-breaking, since either they remind you of a song sequence of his mega hit \"Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam\" or of a powerful scene of \"Devdas\" giving you a seen before kind of feel, repeatedly. The soundtrack too is able to impress only partially with a few good tracks in the initial reels and as the film progresses their excessive use starts becoming annoying, particularly in the second half. To say the truth, being a powerful love story as per its theme, I found the famous \"Bhansali Feel of Love\" also missing in the film replaced by lust, sex and double meaning dialogues quite surprisingly. For instance, I may sound to be an 'old timer' but I don't think a girl can easily come forward and give a straight smooch to a boy if he looks good and of her own type just in the first meeting itself in a public place. Moreover the way both the boy and girl start rolling over each other on the bed with several kisses one after another in their second meeting only����, for me it wasn't anything close to 'Pure Love' but only lust, sex or body hunger and nothing else. Interestingly such depiction of love was not there in any of Bhansali's earlier films. The director never showed his love birds in this kind of sexy, lusty avatars ever before. Hence undoubtedly this time Bhansali is more interested in reaching the masses with cheap insertions of a blue film parlour, David Dhawan like rhyming dialogues, guns, bullets, murders, rape attempts and bloodbath, may be in a state of desperation. Yes, he begins well with an exceptional sequence of rivalry between two groups in the first scene and then handles another sequence depicting the same with a superb camera-work & vision. But actually this isn't a Bhansali genre at all and once the love birds get separated, going into the violent mood, the film falls flat with everyone behaving in a confusing manner not suiting their actual character as defined in the first hour. In the performance section, the actors simply surrender themselves to the vision of their director and the three winners coming out of entire cast are Deepika, Supriya Pathak, and Richa Chadda unarguably. Following the above are Abhimanyu Singh, Gulshan Devaiah, Sharad Kelkarand Barkha Bisht who play their parts well but the director should have given more mileage to Richa Chadda alone. Along with these good performances there are some pretty ordinary ones too including Raza Murad, Homi Wadia and the deliberately added poor item number of Priyanka Chopra. Talking about the lead pair, Deepika once again scores over her hero and she even goes shockingly bold this time as instructed by the so called love-guru i.e. SLB. Ranveer on the other hand, doesn't offer something new, as he plays the same old flirty lover boy with the only difference of his Rajasthani attire and nothing else through a great script too with something novel to share. Revealing the controversy, SLB's film has nothing to do with either Lord Ram or his sacred Leela at all. So the director had a clear intention of using the phrase \"RAM-LEELA\" for his film's instant publicity alone and all this controversy could have been easily avoided by using any other name with a regional touch. Regarding its subject based on Shakespeare's \"Romeo-Juliet\", I remember watching QAYAMAT SE QAYAMAT TAK when I was in school and then few other films too with the same theme. Plus just recently there was not one but two films made on the same subject namely ISHAQZAADE & ISSAQ, which forces me to think that perhaps except Vishal Bhardwaj, very few have read the other classics of William Shakespeare in reality in our own Bollywood. And that might be the reason why they repeatedly pick the same old, over-used Romeo-Juliet again & again to bore the innocent audience quite arrogantly. However there is one more reason which comes to my mind regarding the use of this same theme again and that is the 'Fear of Rejection'. Anyway, for me CINEMA means \"The Art of Storytelling\" and if a film hasn't got a new or interestingly fresh story to tell then it is quite a waste of time despite all the great visuals, drama, music, performances and execution. To elaborate on the same, we have a small life here to live on this planet with a limited capability to read or know all the worth studying literature of the world. So we need the medium of cinema to introduce us to many unknown and unexplored gems written within as well as out of the country following a wider vision. And that is exactly what I search for while watching every new film coming my way in any form. So with a hope that these reputed film-makers of our industry would soon find their old courage back, I can only recommend RAM-LEELA to the viewers who are more interested in just the bodies and not their souls.",
         "In spite of the not-so-appealing formula music and over the top cinematography, the controversy clad 'Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ramleela' was one of the most anticipated movies this year, courtesy SLB. The opening scene has multiple common men shooting bullets and throwing glass bottles with close precision and accuracy. The grand entry of the hero himself, taking a selfie on a motor bike would have been mesmerizing had it been the 1980s. The overly tanned and oiled up body of Mr. Singh and the dhoti tied up as low as humanly possible attracts the attention of very many local women in the movie and a few watching it. Deepika is stunning as Leela, though. But the essence of the subtle yet intense romance of the great work by Shakespeare is completely lost in this very Indian rendition of the same. Mr Bhansali has reduced it to what we as an audience want, colourful dance numbers, extreme drama and a sexual reference in every other scene. Music is no charm either. With irrelevant songs at irrelevant junctions in the film, the audience is bound to get restless. There was a point in the first half when we became desperate for the intermission, it came some 20 minutes later. The second half is no better. With stretchy sequences, pure masala bollywood dialogues, more useless songs, pointless silhouettes and closeups and typical SLB elements at every step, the movie comes to a close. Supriya Pathak's, Richa Chadda's, and Barkha Bisht's performances are the only high for the movie. All in all the movie makes us feel used and violated. The makers of the film try to cash in on their name, legacy and the Indian viewers' mentality and give us a piece of cinema decorated with warm colours and excessive drama. The sad part is they will succeed in their propaganda with critics like Taran Adarsh and Mina Iyer eulogizing every frame. Sad.",
         "Do not waste your time ... unless you watch it just for the sets, not story. The only reason to watch this movie would be for the sets and cinematography - Sanja Leela Bhansali is known for this. Story is horrible and it appears different parts of the story were written by different people. Story is an insult to one's intelligence. They have tried to cast the story as modern day Romeo and Juliet, but no way can that comparison hold. Romeo and Juliet was a class apart. I wish I had seen Captain Philips instead.",
         "I will not talk about the plot for there is none to be talked about - we all are already well-familiar with the age-old story. But I do have to say that the movie also failed in the departments I had expected it to fare better. The over-dose of colors and lavish sets gave me a headache. In fact, it felt that those colors had a character of their own - as if they, not the humans, were the protagonists of the movie, for the human protagonists have been so poorly acted (rather they have been so over- acted) that the colors are anyway a better asset for this movie. Talking of performances, the single-most positive thing about this movie is Supriya Pathak's performance. I have always known Deepika to be someone who cannot act and this movie just confirms that belief, but her co-star in the movie was no better either - both of them provided a commendable show of their anatomical assets to the respective target audiences. Their so-called and highly publicized chemistry, I found to be non-existent. They appeared like two kids playing banal jokes on each other - err... perhaps that these jokes involved revolvers makes them adult. And Ms. Chopra was of course not going to be left behind - she might have succeeded in titillating the rikshaw-wala audience by dancing with an unbuttoned dress. Talking of revolvers, this movie is nowhere near to reality; not that I expected much, knowing that it is Bhansali's movie, but a realistic modern twist to Shakespeare's play could have been somewhat likable. I will not talk of direction, etc. for the risk of sounding pretentious, because one can only direct when one has good material to begin with. The last thing I will talk about is verbal vulgarity. The dialogues in the movie are not romantic; they are horny and outright vulgar. If this was required to support the movie storyline, it would have been another matter. But the plot of the movie does not at all require any such vulgarity. It appears to be just a strategy to titillate the masses, like most other things in the movie. This is the kind of trash Bollywood makes and then people in India wonder why India has such huge number of rape cases. Shame on Bhansali!",
         "I had the not so good fortune of watching Ramleela yesterday. Mr. Bhansali hasn't evolved and this looks like is his desperate attempt to recreate what has worked in the past. The sets look similar to Devdas and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (HDDCS), the music is grand and the background is colorful. The story takes you from not so innocent villagers to a Punjabi styled dance to misplaced Priyanka Chopra song and back to riot torn village. The integral elements of the movie - dialogues, screenplay, and performances have been poorly executed. Deepika looks gorgeous and Ranveer extremely well toned. If they had only stick to looking good... Both the actors deliver over the top performances that are devoid of the energy, excitement, innocence, and passion associated with young love. Each one of their scenes looks like a 'rush' to reach the end. Supporting cast brings some hope to the movie but is not sufficient to save the day. The movie is focused on enforcing 'a formula' without the Bhansali vision and thought we became accustomed to after HDDCS and Devdas. P.S. I will take Aishwarya Rai and Salman Khan over this any day..",
         "i don't get it why people are criticizing so much about this movie.... okay if its about the sultry dialogues i agree they were somewhat vulgar. but to be honest the movie had the elements of romance, chemistry and emotions. the cinematography was great and i loved the colors in the movie.... deepika padukone has become a fine actress and every film of hers depict her smooth acting abilities. ranveer singh is the coolest actor I've ever seen on the screen. the songs are nice and the choreography is outstanding. i couldn't take my eyes off deepika during the song \"nagada sang dhol\". it's a good movie to watch but surely is not a family movie."
