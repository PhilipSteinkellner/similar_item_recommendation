He sells their livestock and small plot of land in exchange for passage for two. He wants to leave their seven children in the care of the eldest and his parents; his father advises him to take one son to be educated in Europe, as economic insurance. The three set off for Istanbul, Milan, and Switzerland, stowing away on a ship. At Lake Como, they pay the rest of their money to unprincipled men who abandon them at an Alpine pass before a blizzard. Father and son are separated from Meryem. Will anyone reach the land of promise?",

         "How many Turkish movies have you seen? This was my first. I found this movie a little better than \"fair.\" The story was a bit depressing but the cinematography was very good. There was some beautiful night-time photography. It's the story of a Kurdish man and his wife making a trip, with one of their seven children, to Switzerland in order to find a better life. Hardships abound, thanks to unscrupulous \"sympathizers\" and they wind up having to travel on foot with other people over the long journey. That journey includes walking up and over snowy mountains. A tough but inspiring story, which is what it was meant to me.",
         "This film takes you on one family's impossible journey, and makes you feel every step of their odyssey. Beautifully acted and photographed, heartbreakingly real. Its last line, with its wistful hope, is one of the more powerful in memory.",
         "Frustrating to watch because of one man's stubbornness to leave his native country for the dream land in Switzerland and what he does to achieve that creates heartache for all those involved. Along the journey he encounters scumbags who take advantage of other human suffering and desperation.",
         "Everyday we can watch a great number of film, soap... on tv. Sometimes a miracle happens. A great film, with real feelings, with great actors, with a great realisator-director. For me there are two films that everyone needs to see : the first is the Pacula ? \"Sophie 's choice\" with Meryl Streep. The second is \"Journey of Hope\". As human beings, we need to learn about humility, about love of the others, about acceptation of other civilisation, other way of living. We also have to struggle against racism and fascim. We must avoid judging, criticize; we only have to love our earth companion. This wonderful film, helps us reaching John (Lennon) his dream : Imagine all the people living live in peace. These two films are difficult to see : watch these, but sure you will be hurt, but better. Great film, great actors, terrible story, pain and cry guarantee, but also better understanding of the others. Enjoy it.",
         "The Journey of Hope (1990) is about a trek that many nomadic and poor Turks make so they could live the good life in Switzerland. These people are so desperate to live like Westerners that they'll give up their life and lives in an attempt to reach the promised land. So many of them are swindled by greedy crooks who make their living off of charging huge fees for desperate people who are in a no win situation. One family braves the cold, the treacherous mountain range and predatory criminals only to discover that there's not always a shining white light at the end of the tunnel. This problem exists world wide, not just in America. Some people tend to forget that. A heart breaker of a film that'll leave you wondering why at the end. Highly recommended.",
         "\"Die Reise der Hofnung\" is one of the best movies ever made in switzerland.Maybe only the director comes from switzerland,but I know him personally,and he told me that the whole movie was shot in switzerland.The story is about a turkish family,that leaves their country to come to switzerland.But they have to solve a lot of problems and some other stuff.(Some times the movie is a bit of irrational,for example why didn't they ask for help when they finally arrived in switzerland?)Xavier Koller,the director show us how difficult life is in the balcan. Great movie! 9/10",
         "As in Argentina, France, Italy, Spain and United States, among other, they suffer of the illegal immigration. This movie transports us toward Switzerland, country recognized by its neutrality and hospitality toward the rest of the world. The main characters are a family of Turks that they yearn to be able to go to the earth of their dreams: Switzerland, to feel well, since Turkey is not very economically and labor. All clever one so that Haydar and their wife can carry out their dream, carried out passports, passages... but they will have a complication, they will take to one of their children: Mehmet Ali. Of a supposition trip of pleasure toward the \"earth of their dream\" will go by unexpected situations, as to travel in an export craft or to try to enter to Switzerland in hidden truck, since Mehmet Ali doesn't possess neither passage neither passport. They will be in the same situation that other immigrants that want to enter there; they will go by the Alps, a beautiful place but at the same time cold and where they will happen totally unexpected situations. Xavier Koller obtains with \"Journey of Hope\" an astonishing realization that makes us see that each one has the dream of being able to go to the place that offers them peace, but that they will also go by unexpected moments, with an end that could be unexpected for the spectator. Deserved of the Oscar like Best Foreign Language Film 1990/1991. My opinion: Wonderful, Human, One of the Best Foreign Film Oscar winner. Don't get lost it.",
         "This is as powerful as a drama can possibly get! It's a story that in real life has probably repeated itself over and over again. The origin of the people may have changed. The location of their treacherous journey may have changed. But essentially, the drama remains the same, be it 20 years ago in the Swiss Alps, or today somewhere in the Mediterranean between Northern Africa and Italy. Those fleeing from Political turmoil, from war or simply from poverty, will do anything to find a better life, and hope is what is driving them. And along the way they are more than likely to come across scrupulous criminals whose sole interest is to make money out of the misery of those poor souls trying to find \"paradise\". I cannot think of a movie that would portray this better than \"Journey Of Hope\". It's extremely powerful and comes across as very believable all the way. No wonder, as the story repeats itself in reality time and time again. Only the outcome may vary. I can only recommend this film!",
         "If the redundancy of getting off the boat, on the boat, off the bus, on the bus.. is a way to waste time then you should go back to the Hollywood films that wrap this part up in one montage in order to get to the money shots. and in doing so leave you unconnected and in the cinematic limbo that results from not really showing the realities of life. The long drawn out travel sequences actually allow the viewer the same frustration and 'wait- in-line' feeling the characters must endure. Frustrating? yes. Vital? Indeed. the limbo of that travel is the key to the 'rootlessness' of this Turkish family. Beautiful film with great acting. Sad, but worth it.",
         "Tragically heart wrenching drama about a Turkish couple and son who cross the Swiss Alps illegally in search of a new life. Realistic. Moving. Sad. Unforgettable. Won the 1990 Academy Award for the Best Foreign Language Film."
