         "I don't normally see a lot of short films but I happened across this one and thought that it was hilarious, and even in its sadder moments, I still had to laugh. There aren't a lot of films that can make me laugh until I cry but this was one of them. The acting is outstanding; it is well written; well directed; and the clown is very accomplished. I can't tell you the story because that would absolutely ruin the film for you. Just take my word for it that it is a very clever, special, and even unique film.",
         "Like many people, I came to this film off the back of the fuss over the recent SNL sketch that allegedly borrows heavily from this short. I've not seen that sketch, although was surprised that it involved Louis CK (since his promotion of one of Tig Notaro's shows is why I know here); instead I decided to just take the fuss as a good reason to watch the original short film. The concept is what you have heard, which is a woman depressed and home-alone decides to book herself a clown. It isn't more complex than that, but the awkward color of the clown contrasts nicely with the drab emotional reality of the characters. This pained awkward plays out well, although it helps if you like that style of humor. In other works I have found Notaro's darkness to be a bit too much, but here I found it accessible without being diluted. The pleasure of her character, and the interaction with the clown is a nice core to the film, but there are also some funny jokes and ideas too. Perhaps not brilliant, but a nice idea, good delivery, and an enjoyably funny and awkward short."
