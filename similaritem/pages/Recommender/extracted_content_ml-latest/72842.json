         "content": "A fun and very entertaining sports / action film that's truly\r\nunderrated! Dolph Lundgren - star of a whole bunch of epic actioners\r\nfrom THE EXPENDABLES to RED SCORPION - is on fine performance as this\r\nPentathlon player. Is there nothing this man can't do?! What we have\r\nhere is a slightly different Lundgren vehicle - it's less about\r\nshooting up baddies and more about competing...with Nazis, naturally.\r\nInstead what we get is Dolph film in which his character is not only a\r\npowerful and strong bad-ass, but sensitive and very funny at time.\r\nPENTATHLON is a mighty fine sports film which is perfect for the\r\nOlympics fever that's spreading around with the build up to the 2012\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nActing along side Dolphy is the brilliant Mr David Soul (from SALEM'S\r\nLOT, STARSKY AND HUTCH and the hilariously offensive JERRY SPRINGER:\r\nTHE OPERA). His performance is equally great, in which he plays a cold,\r\nevil Nazi hell bent on winning at any cost. And I mean ANY cost!\r\nPENTATHLON is a fantastic film for any and every action and sports fan.\r\nThe perfect piece of entertainment for the Olympics build-up too. The\r\nnew Anchor Bay Blu-ray is presented in glorious high-def, this release\r\nis the best you'll ever see it!",

         "****SPOILERS**** Insane movie about big time East German Olympic Gold Medal winner Eric Brogar, Dolph Lundgren, defecting to the west. This was after Eric took all the muck and insults that he could handle from his crazed and obnoxious coach Mueller, David Soul, but finds out that the free world is not what he thought it was. Ending up at a greasy spoon in L.A as a short order cook Eric is very unhappy with his life until his boss Creese, Roger E. Molsey, checking in on Eric, one afternoon.Creese finds a load of newspaper clippings as well as his gold medal and gets the bright idea of having Eric train for the next Olympics. Trying to be a \"Rocky\" clone the movie fails miserably since Lundgren is so powerful and intimidating in every scene that he's in, as well as him being a former Olympic Gold Medal winner, when he's competing that you feel more sympathy for his opponents then for him. Meanwhile back in East Germany with the communist government out of business Mueller forms a new Neo-Nazi organization to take over the country and bring back the \"Good old Days\" of German glory. Mueller now has other ideas on his former \"friend\" and fellow German Eric Brogar. Mueller also didn't forget Eric's betrayal and took time to pay his father Rodolph, Erik Holland, a visit and gave him a hard and strenuous workout that ends up killing him. Eric finds love with his American girlfriend Julia, Renee Coleman, and is starting to get into shape for the Olympics when Mueller shows up in town to start an American chapter of his new Neo-Nazi organization. After failing to take out Eric who ended up hammering a number of Mueller's brown shirts Mueller has his gang storm Julia's home. With a couple of his Aryan Supermen Mueller beat the living hell out of Julia's 70 or so year-old father and shoot Creese who came over to have lunch. Eric who came over later is beaten up and taken hostage by Mueller's goons who plan to blow up a German government \"Never Again\" rally that is against Mueller's Neo-Nazi party. Mueller is so crazy that he holds off the fireworks until he has a tape of him played on live TV. It's on the tape where he brags about his great ideas for the future of Germany and the world. This gives Eric enough time to escape and stop Mueller and his gang from doing any damage. With the help of the local police Eric finishes off Mueller's Nazi followers. Off-the-wall ending with Mueller getting blasted by Eric some time later when he tries to shoot him at a sporting event, where else, when the alert Julia spots Mueller and knocks the gun out of his hand. Dopey movie with a very predictable plot and with big bad Dolph Lundgren given a little more meat in his role as the hero with some comedy and sensitive, as well as the usual action, scenes. You have to give the Academy Award to David Soul in one of the most insane as well as overblown and ham acting parts of his career. Soul made you realize why Hitler lost the Second World War. Proving what the saying \"With friends like him you don't need enemies\" really means.",
         "Being a big Dolph Lundgren fan, I was surprised to see a completely different side of him in this one, portraying him as being a pathetic, injured burnout who flips burgers for a living, while walking down dark alleys with no company beside his portable TV and his beer. When he is menaced by a group of hoodlums, they laugh at him when his trick knee gives out and he can't chase them. This struck me as being very odd, because it was Dolph acting like a regular guy, rather than the sarcastic killing machines he's typecast as. Sadly, as enjoyable as all of the footage of him being a loser (and his inspiring comeback into grade-A Pentathalon runner material), it sort of abruptly switches gears, turning into one of his usual action movies with a nonsense subplot involving neo-Nazis. It's a shame that the whole thing couldn't have been like the first two acts, or this would be by far his best performance, in a close tie with GR13 from Universal Soldier.",
         "I enjoyed this film. I must admit I only watched it because I am a bit of a David Soul fan. However, it took quite a bit to get used to David Soul in such a different role than the type he played in Starsky & Hutch. Nevertheless, it was quite exciting, and had me trying unsuccessfully to work out what was going to happen. I found the acting quite good. David Soul did a good German accent. It also had Roger E Mosley (TC from Magnum), playing a good role too. I am glad I saw it.",
         "This has to be one of the worst films I ever watched. Actually, it was so painful, I could not bear to watch it all the way to the end. Now I know where Americans get the grey image of \"communism\" from. A completely unrealistic portrait of what life was like in East Germany!!!",
         "Pentathalon is absolutely hilarious, Dolph definitely at his prime. So many ridiculous scenes from the trashcan window throw to Brogar run. I have gotten so much enjoyment from this film i feel i should pay Dolph. I am still curious as to why Dolph flushes the toilet after I think it's Offerman gets beat up over the toilet. Do not take this movies seriously though because its just worth it to actually think about it.Hutch from the old Starsky and Hutch is the old Nazi guy who you can't understand a single word he says because he is so crazy. Its also great because Bruce Malmuth stars in it as well in which he also wrote the story for. This was definitely the movie that made Dolph more passionate about making such hilarious films.",
         "People may crack on Dolph but many don't have his education, physical prowess, or his comic timing. Too often action stars are labeled for poor acting skills. This is one of my favorite movies with two great performances. Dolph giving his all and being very believable as a has been athlete who seems to have lost his way. David Soul giving a Bond Villain worthy air to a crazed sociopath. It is a shame that neither get more high profile roles that showcases their excellence. That being said it is totally a movie of its time and does not age too well. Still a 90's classic that does not get mentioned as much as it should! I would recommend this to action, sport, and drama fans.",
         "Dolph Lundgren just may be the greatest living human. He can sing, dance, act, produce, direct, do martial arts, all while doing a rockin' drum solo. He excels in every sport he tries, and according to his bio, he received a Master's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Sydney in Australia and was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to MIT. So he's light years away from his legions of meathead imitators. Keeping his Superman status in mind, here, in Pentathlon, Lundgren portrays Eric Brogar, a Pentathlete (yes, it's a real word), who is trained in East Germany pre-Berlin Wall falling to compete in the Olympics by tyrannical jerkbag Heinrich Muller. Muller wants to use him as an example of East Germany's greatness, but Brogar is actually a sensitive soul who wants more out of life. He loves America, so he risks it all to come to the USA, using the American Olympic team to help him. He thinks he escapes Muller's iron fist forever. Now in L.A., Brogar has hit the skids. He drinks, smokes, eats greasy food and lives in a dive. He even works in a greasy spoon. His boss John Creese (Mosley) is a kind, charismatic man that tries to get to know Brogar. When he discovers Brogar used to be a Pentathlete, he takes it upon himself to train him and get him back into shape for the Atlanta Olympics. Meanwhile, Brogar romances fellow Olympian Julia (Coleman). Things are starting to look up for Brogar, but then Muller, who now is the head of a neo-Nazi organization, tracks him down. Brogar must fight to protect what he now has, his bright future, from the shadows of his dark past. Can he use his Pentathlon skills to fight in real life? A Pentathlon is an Olympic event that consists of Shooting, Fencing, Swimming, Horse Riding and Cross-Country Running. Surprisingly, it took until 1994 for someone to make an entire movie around this concept. The natural choice for star was Ubermensch Dolph Lundgren. He's pitch-perfect as Brogar. It's impossible to imagine anyone else playing this role. But really, Pentathlon is a weird movie. It's pretty offbeat for a Lundgren/action film. It's sort of a sporting movie, with the pain of the Berlin wall experience thrown in, and some Nazis, and some romance, and some training, and Dolph fighting the baddies. It's certainly different. But in this case, different is good. We liked Pentathlon. It's not a cookie-cutter action flick. It strives for more, much like its hero Eric Brogar. We thought fencing movies started and ended with Ring of Steel (1994). But we were mistaken. Chapin's got nothing on Eric Brogar. David Soul is also great as the Nazi Muller. He really throws himself into the role and you hate him. He wants to crash the \"Never Again\" rally condemning Nazis and terrorists. Naturally the featured singer is some hippie singing \"Peoplllleee are the saaammeee....\" There is an inexplicable, hilarious scene in the greasy spoon featuring one of Muller's goons towards the end of the film. You'll know it when you see it - we don't want to give it away, but trust us, you'll be laughing. Hint: it involves a boombox. Pentathlon is surprisingly different for a Dolph vehicle. Check it out soon.",
         "If you don't have anything smart to do, please find something, just don't watch this movie. Or watch it if you wanna die of boredom! It's absolutely awful, full of stupidities, full of logic and historical holes, full of terrible acting (as expected, after all we're talking about Dolph Lundgren), full of clichés, full of stereotypes... Director and writer Bruce Malmuth showed that he doesn't know anything about (modern) history. One day the main negative character is Stasi member and the other day he is a Neonazi?! Hello! Anything sounds strange here? Once again, find something else to do rather than losing 100 valuable minutes of your life.",
         "This is below standard, even for a straight-to-video Dolph Lundgren flick. PENTATHLON is an action thriller which offers up very little in the way of action - a couple of fights, a few chases, and of course the explosive finale aside - but instead seems to be some kind of \"human drama\". Long sequences show Lundgren training with his new boss, played by Roger E. Mosley. Now while I appreciate the introduction of a little bit of characterisation into a film - something so often lacking with these kind of flicks - this stuff takes up a full half an hour before we get back to the plot again. The film doesn't seem to know what it wants to be, and by introducing lame action scenes it just doesn't cut it. Perhaps if they had got rid of the action altogether and concentrated on the human relationships then it would have been easier to watch. Now, on the good side, at least the plot is fairly original and not just another DIE HARD clone - that counts for something. On the bad side we have Lundgren giving what has to be one of his worst, most wooden performances as the German athlete, failing to instil his character with any kind of respect or appreciation from the viewer. He's just wooden and blank. On to the other extreme, with a hammy David Soul playing a Neo Nazi with a terrible accent - this was the kind of stuff which helped to kill of Soul's \"career\", something which had been dwindling since the '70s. To be fair, his extremely amusing performance is one thing which makes this movie easier to watch. It always makes me laugh, the way that producers of these films manage to team up current actors with some old has-been from the '70s. Aside from these two, there's a likable turn from Mosley and an instantly forgettable role for the love interest, played by a bland Renee Coleman. Now, while the human side of the story may be okay and unexpected, this film has a big problem with pacing. Nothing much happens for an hour or so only to have the final showdown taking place in the space of 15 minutes - and feeling extremely rushed as a result of this. While the fight scenes are okay, the actual violence itself is very boring and predictable, with a couple of people getting shot in the chest and that's it. PENTATHLON gets a star each for the film and Dolph Lundgren, and an extra star for watching David Soul chew the scenery time after time.",
         "Pentathlon is not an enjoyable experience, and despite the fact that I dig Dolph as an action hero, I was bored silly during this movie. It's clearly inspired by Rocky, only Rocky didn't have a lack of action, a poor story and horrible dialog to sit through. One of the worst things about this movie is David Soul's performance as the villain. He is WAY too over the top and laughably campy, he ruined much of the experience for me and he didn't mesh well with Dolph at all. As I said I'm a Dolph fan, he's far from a great actor but his charisma and presence is awesome to say the least, so when I found this for 2 dollars at a VHS blowout sale I decided to pick it up. Dolph's rigorous training scenes are impressive and the bantering with Roger E. Mosley as Creese was somewhat fun, but the action is clearly lacking. I'm a film buff, but I enjoy B-movies and low-budget movies as well, I'm very open-minded, but Pentathlon has nothing out of the ordinary and to be honest it was a waste of 2 bucks. Performances. Dolph Lundgren tries really hard, but his accent works against him and some of his dialog is absolutely awful. He has charisma to spare but that can only take him so far. David Soul is laughable as the villain. On more than one occasion I wanted him off my screen for tarnishing the quality, he obviously knows he is in a below average movie and disgustingly tries to camp it up. He's better than this, much better, watch Magnum Force to see what I mean. Roger E. Mosley is fun as Creese, but did test my patience with his act sometimes. Renée Coleman is pretty wooden as the love interest. Bottom line. Definitely one of Dolph's lesser works and not even enjoyable for B-movie value. It's boring and will annoy you to no end. Avoid it. 2 1/2 /10",
         "This has got to be one of the five best movies of all time, it is absolutely amazing. Dolph should have won many academy awards already in his illustrious career, but he tends to be overlooked. When I think of exciting action, I think of Dolph Lundgren. Dolph is also very versatile, he can play almost any role, from the sinister yet likable Ivan Drago, to the amazing Major Frank Cross, and who can forget him as He-man, I thought he should have got best actor for that. In this film he does an excellent job as Eric Brogar, he truly shows that anyone can go to the Olympics, if they train hard enough. Keep on making those great movies Dolph!!! GO DOLPH!!!!!!!!!!!",
         "Has there EVER been a Hollywood film that criticises or even challenges the assumption that the United States is the greatest most noble most selflessly benevolent country to have ever existed on Planet Earth? I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that EVERY single Hollywood film i have ever seen propagates - to a greater or lesser extent, either implicitly or explicitly - such myths. And, surprise surprise, \"Pentathlon\" is no exception. Yes, once again, the bogeyman is Caaaaamunism, this time in the shape of the former German Democratic Republic, as Yankee meathead Dolph Lundgren stars as an East German pentathlete who ends up escaping from the evil clutches of the nasty old GDR, by defecting to the good old Land of the Free and Home of the Brave (don't laugh!) during the '88 Seoul Olympics. I mean, it says a lot about the US film industry, that even in 1994 (when this appalling film was made) they just couldn't resist the temptation to drag the memory of Communism through the dirt some more. The truth of course is that, while the former Communist regimes of the Eastern Bloc were far from perfect, they did provide a substantial social safety net for their people in terms of relatively good working conditions, pensions, free health care, free education (including at university level!), affordable housing, etc, etc. The destruction of this social safety net since the collapse of Communism has resulted in widespread misery across Eastern Europe, particularly in the former Soviet Union itself, where at least 3 million are estimated to have died as a direct result of the wiping out of the old Soviet welfare state. In response to my comments here, the apologists for western capitalist imperialism will no doubt point to the likes of those who were killed whilst trying to flee across the Berlin Wall from East to West. To those people i would say the following: Firstly, how many people were actually killed in such circumstances during the lifetime of the wall (1961-1989)? Answer: 171. While terrible (as any deaths are), this number pales into insignificance when compared with (to pick just one example from the many available), say, the number of Afghan civilians killed during the US bombardment of that country in late 2001 (scholarly estimates put the figure at at least 3,700). The difference is, of course, that the US capitalist ruling class cares passionately about civilian death when it can be used as a stick to beat Communism with, yet remains blissfully nonchalant about civilian death when it occurs as \"collateral damage\" during one of the countless wars of US imperial expansion. And it can hardly be argued that the US ruling class at least cares about its own people. How many have perished as a result of the perennial refusal to go against the interests of the Health Insurance industry lobby by establishing a free national health service for America? How many have perished as a result of the relentless attacks on welfare support since the late 70s? And this is before you've even mentioned things like Huricane Katrina, or the small matter of whatever happened to the Native Americans (can genocide only be something that the Nazis did to the Jews?). Now the supporters of American Imperialism here might well still argue that surely the very fact that people attempted to escape across the Berlin Wall from East to West, demonstrates just how repressive the GDR regime was. Well actually, all it demonstrates is how much more affluent life in West Berlin was. Such a point is hardly controversial. Everybody knows that capitalist First World societies have a lot of wealth. What fewer people appreciate is that most of this wealth comes from the intensive exploitation by western corporations of cheap industrial and agricultural labour in the West's neo-colonies in the Third World. The Eastern Bloc (on principle) had no such neo-colonial relationships with Third World countries (Cuba, for example, sold sugar to the USSR at six times the market value, because the USSR believed in helping Third World countries rather than exploiting them). As a result, of course life in East Berlin was grim and grey and austere compared to West Berlin - a fact the US exploited to the hilt by pumping more and more money into West Berlin, effectively dangling the consumer lifestyle before the eyes of the East Berliners. \"Anything\", in the words of an internal CIA memo since declassified, \"to make the Commies look bad\". The idea, of course, was to bleed the GDR of its productive population, and thus bring the Communist state to its knees. With the end of the GDR, western big business could look forward to the opening up of vast new labour and consumer markets to exploit. This was always the goal of the US anti-Communist strategy. As with the more recent example of the Iraq War, it was never anything to do with \"spreading democracy\" (capitalists do not know the meaning of the term). On the contrary, it was everything to do with advancing the economic interests of the mega-rich US big business ruling class. And finally, why is it that apologists for western imperialism have a problem with a wall built in Berlin to keep Western spies out, yet have no problem whatsoever with a wall built in the Occupied Territories to keep poor Palestinians out of the luxurious villas of the Israeli colonists, nor with a proposed wall built along the Rio Grande to keep poor Mexicans out of the US? In fact, isn't every anti-immigration law enacted by a rich western state effectively a wall? It appears that, for the imperialist apologists, some walls are more equal than others. For an honest view of the history of the German Democratic Republic, i strongly recommend you read Mary Fulbrook's excellent 2004 book, \"The People's State\". Don't expect films like \"Pentathlon\" to tell you the truth!!",
         "A fun and very entertaining sports / action film that's truly underrated! Dolph Lundgren - star of a whole bunch of epic actioners from THE EXPENDABLES to RED SCORPION - is on fine performance as this Pentathlon player. Is there nothing this man can't do?! What we have here is a slightly different Lundgren vehicle - it's less about shooting up baddies and more about competing...with Nazis, naturally. Instead what we get is Dolph film in which his character is not only a powerful and strong bad-ass, but sensitive and very funny at time. PENTATHLON is a mighty fine sports film which is perfect for the Olympics fever that's spreading around with the build up to the 2012 event. Acting along side Dolphy is the brilliant Mr David Soul (from SALEM'S LOT, STARSKY AND HUTCH and the hilariously offensive JERRY SPRINGER: THE OPERA). His performance is equally great, in which he plays a cold, evil Nazi hell bent on winning at any cost. And I mean ANY cost! PENTATHLON is a fantastic film for any and every action and sports fan. The perfect piece of entertainment for the Olympics build-up too. The new Anchor Bay Blu-ray is presented in glorious high-def, this release is the best you'll ever see it!",
         "Dolph Lundgren stars as an Olympic athlete who is looking to make his comeback. However not only does Lundgren face the hurdles of getting back in shape, quitting smoking and pulling himself out of a depression he also has to contend with a psychopath/neo-Nazi coach (David Soul) who is still obsessed with him after Lundgren defected years before. Dolph Lundgren is really one of the most inconsistent action stars in the business, for every enjoyable action flick he makes (The Punisher, I Come In Peace, Universal Soldier,Army Of One) there is more that are just plain terrible (Cover-Up, Masters Of The Universe, Red Scorpion) however in sheer dullness few of his titles live up to the painfulness of Pentathlon. I admit that the plot hints at some fun, with Lundgren facing a neo-Nazi army while training for the Olympics but sadly this is supposed to be character driven and in the hands of Lundgren, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that he's in way over his head. Lundgren tries extremely hard to make the part credible but he fails and instead contributes one of his worst performances to date. Lundgren of course can be effective mainly when he beats up on various bad guys but we instead get too many scenes of Lundgren soul searching and hence this is as dull as it gets. David Soul is amusing in the role, adding a wisp to his villainous scowl which almost makes up for the horrendous story but overall let's face it, placing him against Dolph Lundgren is nearly impossible and it's hard to believe that a director (Who helmed Nighthawks mind you!) could believe in the idea that a fight between Lundgren and Soul would even be close. Worst of all there is next to zero action, it's as if Lundgren wanted to try and act and despite his best efforts, one will never appreciate him for anything more than just providing mindless action and nothing else beyond that. Lundgren has a screen presence sure, but he's not a great actor so if you take away his ability to fight then it's no secret the movie is bound to be a disappointment. * out of 4-(Bad)",
         "While at the Olympics, Eric Brogar (Dolph Lundgren) escapes communist West Germany & flees to America. But after hearing that the no-goodniks have killed his father, he starts on a downward spiral until Creese (Roger \"T.C.\" Mosley), his burger manager, starts training him for the Olympics again. Then Mueller (David \"Hutch\" Soul), Eric's commie former-trainer shows up. Will Eric prevail and find true love with Julia (Renee \"Evil leaper from Quantum Leap\" Colemen)? This film was overall enjoyable to me for some reason. Not great, mind you, but enjoyable as a time-waister. The acting's servicable enough. My Grade: C Where i saw it: Showtime beyond",
         "How damned stupid could people be, to constitute Germans like in this movie. The Nazis and all Neonazis (not just in Germany) have nothing in common with the Stasi and the DDR. Its kind of an opposite! Do not watch this movie, it just crap and it tells you just crap. Maby Dolph Lundgren is the best thing in this movie and that means a lot! The story is so thin, you can watch trough it after the five minutes. The whole movie is pure waste of time. It's not even funny, like b-movies. Excepting the Nazi terrorists that come up with a rocket to shoot the German ambassador. By the way, David Drummond has the role of the German guy Hundt. Correctly it's spelled Hund and means dog.",
         "Another shot of Dolphine straight to the system. Pentathalalogram is a movie about swimming, surprisingly, and there are no bullets. However, there are: swimming pools, water, treading water, the butterfly and the backstroke and bathing suits and diving boards but nobody dives. Dolph here plays Dolph who plays a swimmer who gets chased by his former coach because he is just so awesome and swimmy that his coach falls in love with him in a nice way and stuff. Unfortunately, Dolph does not explode any aliens in this one or decapitate any children but hey, you gotta take the wheat with the chaff and this is pretty chaffy. Pentagram/Rhombus",
         "The funniest thing about this movie is that the story may seem implausible actually happened in REAL life. Read the book \"Tod dem Verraeter\" (2000) by Heribert Schwan. It tells the TRUE story of olympic athlete, Lutz Eigendorf, who escapes East Germany and is tracked down allegedly by Stasi and murdered. This movie seems like a bad joke by comparison. The movie requires a LOT from Dolph Lundgren in terms of acting and poor Dolph is just TERRIBLE here. It's a truly cringe worthy experience . Lundgren tries extremely hard to make the part credible but he fails and gives one of worst performances in his career. David Soul who plays the villain is also INCREDIBLY ANNOYING. Overall , the acting in the whole movie is awful. \"Pentathlon\" is full of stupidities, full of logic and historical holes (Nazis don't have anything in common with Stasi ! ) , full of clichés and stereotypes (a completely unrealistic portrait of what life was like in East Germany ). Lack of action, a poor story and horrible dialogs. It doesn't work as a drama , even less as action movie. I admire Lundgren's ambition , but this movie simply sucks. The training sequences and the bantering with Roger E. Mosley as Creese was somewhat fun. However it can't save this movie. Better watch \"Rocky\". Director/writer Bruce Malmuth has made an good action movie before \u2013 \"Nighthawks\" with Sylvester Stallone and Rutger Hauer. Better watch that movie instead of this crap. I give it 1/10.",
         "Guilty pleasure, all the way! I can't put down this movie cause it was a lot of fun to watch it, the director kept it simple, with some wrong doings but those can be excused. It's generic and almost dumb but you'll feel good through the whole thing. \"Pentathlon\" transforms Dolph Lundgren (oh, in the 1990's, the best of times to watch him!) into a super gold medalist during the Cold Era who defects from East Germany to the U.S., much to the anger of his demanding coach (David Soul), during the Seul Olympics. Living in America, he's a complete nobody, working as a cook but with the help of his boss he has a chance to return to his passion: being an athlete But after the collapse of the Soviet regime and the reunification of Germany, the coach - now allied with a Neonazi group - goes to America to join Nazi group in America, and if possible, to recruit his former athlete to the cause (terrorism, obviously). I think you've already drowned into the amount of absurd throw in just this basic plot line, but to hell with it. As an action flick is quite good, except for the insanely goofs here and there (the one with the gun is amazingly laughable, with the bad using a Walter PPK-like pistol that sounds like a revolver and with a silencer that doesn't work), and some shameless plot holes as well - what bothered me the most was the inconsistence concerning David Soul's character. How in the world someone so loyal to the Communism becomes part of a Nazi group? Nevermind. Works better as a comedy vehicle with positive scenes with Dolph's boss turned to coach, played by Roger E. Mosley. Laughs are granted with this dude. And if neither that can help you, at least the movie offers a quality camera work capturing the splendid and hunky leading man. A severe case of a movie so bad that it's good. Enjoy it. 6/10",
         "Pentathlon tells the story of an olympic athlete who defects to the USA and is hunted by East German Stasi agent (David Soul). Compare film with the German book, \"Tod dem Verraeter\" (2000) by Heribert Schwan, which tells the TRUE story of olympic athlete, Lutz Eigendorf, who escapes East Germany and is tracked down allegedly by Stasi and murdered. When I watched Pentathlon I could not help but compare it to the book and wonder where the film writers came up with the story???? And by the way, Soul, with a pseudo German accent, is awful in this flick. Wherever the film's plot came from, it could have been an exciting action film. Instead it was dull and plodding.",
         "I found this movie a big disappointment. This is sad because it has good actors, good production values and a fine plot. But after awhile it just becomes another dull thriller that runs out of ideas. Dolph is the German gold medalist in the pentathlon who flees to America to get away from his mad Nazi coach (David Soul). Some years later, his coach comes after him and the action starts. David Soul is very good as the coach, and plays the part menacingly and convincingly. Dolph is very good in his role too, and gives one of his best performances ever. There are some good action scenes, but apart from that the whole thing begins to go downhill. This was a pity considering it was released after the excellent Army Of One, which I think is Dolph's best movie by far. Pentathlon is still a good flick, just not as good as I expected. It's still a great movie to watch to kill time. Overall I would recommend you get Army Of One instead though, it's much better."
