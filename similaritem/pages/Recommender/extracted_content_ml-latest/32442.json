      "synopsis": "Joe MacTeague [Kirk Douglas] is a rich old man but he wants to know which of his relatives really cares about him.His nephews and niece Carl [Ed Begley jr],Frank [Phil Hartman],Glen [Jere Burns] and Patti [Colleen Camp] visit him time and again at his mansion to please,amuse and generally suck up to him,even trying to outdo each other to try and win favour with him for his fortune. One day,they discover Joe has hired a beautiful english woman called Molly [Olivia D,Abo] to serve him as a private nurse and after witnessing how close the two of them seem, the family start to worry about her intentions for their Uncle's money.They hire a private detective to find more out about her and soon realise that they can't possibly compete with what Molly can offer Joe.Desperate not to give up,they decide to track down Danny [Michael J.Fox] now a grown up bowler,who was forced to leave the family years earlier with his father,after an heated argument with Joe.But the family remember how fond of Danny jr,Joe was. Danny has had to give up his bowling career after injuring his wrist,but has decided to invest in a bowling centre with a couple of friends.He tells his girlfriend Robin [Nancy Travis] that it's going to cost $300,000 dollars,but he soon realises he could be in luck when the detective tracks him down, and tells him about his family's invitation to Joe's.Danny asks him for a loan,but Joe tells him he will only lend him the money if he chooses him over his dad.Danny refuses. Later,Joe apologizes for suggesting something like that,but tells him it was because he was testing him to see if he was like his relatives.Danny soon realises that Joe is becoming ill and starts to worry when Joe tells him he plans on giving his money to Molly.Danny moves in with him to try and prevent that from happening.And it works.But his relatives are angry that he doesn't plan on sharing any money with them after deciding that they're scumbags and Molly is angry that he's taking Joe's money while he's still alive. Desperate for none of the Macteague's to get their inheritance,Molly decides to finally do what she said she never would - have sex with the old man.But just as she is about to go through with it,they are interrupted by Danny's father,who is disgusted that nothing has changed in the household since he left.Danny gets into a huge argument with him and ends up choosing Uncle Joe over his dad.Molly decides to leave after she realises how low she nearly sunk,and that deep down she was only ever really there for the money.Robin tries to comfort Danny about the situation with his dad,but he tells her that it wasn't really his dad.It was in fact an actor that he'd hired,in order to make out to his uncle that he loved him more than his dad.Robin is disgusted and leaves. At Joe's attorney's office,Danny is waiting with Joe ready to gain all of his money and posessions,but they are interrupted by the rest of the family who have brought along Danny's real father.Feeling ashamed that his dad knows all about his schemes,Danny admits that he's become just as greedy as the rest of them.But he and the family soon find out that not only is Joe broke,he's also $93,000 dollars in debt.A fight breaks out between the family and everyone is told to leave,but not before Danny tells Joe how much he hates him.But when Danny goes back to Robin,she reminds him how much he does actually care about his uncle. The two of them let the ill and homeless Joe stay with them in their apartment,but Joe has a surprise for them when they look out the window and see his butler across the street with Molly.He's not really broke.\"I'm richer than shit\".He tells them that they've proved their love for him and they can stay with him at his mansion and co - own everything of his.And his final surprise for them - he gets up out of his wheelchair and walks out.",

         "A wonderful, little known movie. I join the others here who wonder how this jewel slipped past recognition in theaters. I was amazed when I stumbled across it- I don't even recall how. What a joy. I remain shocked that such a good film is so unknown. The timing, the dialogue, the hilarious writing... What distribution company dropped the ball on this one? The dinner table scene at the beginning is the best ensemble five minutes or so I have ever watched. It's like a brilliant verbal volleyball game, comments popped from one character to the next, no one letting the ball drop. This family deserves each other. I, like \"Little Daniel\" was rooting for \"the Limey Chick.\" The blending of actors is perfect. Michael J. Fox, being Michael J. Fox alone should have assured the movie's recognition...oh yeah, that's why I rented it. Phil Hartman- what a brilliant man- but enough of that. He was unique and perfect as the spearhead of the obnoxious clan. This movie does not make the common mistake of relying on well known actors and letting the script fend for itself. The concept, writing, acting, and unusual twists are well crafted. Everyone did his job. Except that distribution company. Does anybody have their address?",
         "Greedy is a film you may have passed on Showtime, or glanced at in the TV Guide and thought, \"never heard of it\". To be honest, I can't recall its stint in the theaters either. However, on the recommendation of my father, I gave it a chance. The interaction between all of the characters is terrific. Phil Hartman gives comic brilliance, mixed with wit and sarcasm in his usual way. This movie has a lot of laugh out loud moments for people who are into clever comedy with a slightly twisted mind. It is cemented in my comedy top 5 with Stripes, Planes Trains and Automobiles, Ferris Buellers Day Off, and Ridgemont. Highly recommended! 9/10",
         "Saw it before, and watched it again last night, even though I normally don't watch films twice. Period. I think this is a brilliant film. The humour in it is great, even though I knew what was coming. I mean: the fact that I remembered some of the lines from watching it a couple of years ago, while I can't remember what I had for dinner yesterday, speaks for itself. In my book anyway. :-) Regardless of the comments, by others or myself, this film deserves a chance, so if you've never seen it I heartily recommend watching it. I'm (pretty) sure you'll love it.",
         "You must see this movie if you like Phil Hartman and offbeat comedies! And if you simply don't care about popular opinion and what critics say, then you should definitely see this movie! This film tackles a subject matter that I've never seen in a movie: inheriting money and being included in a will. Kirk Douglas plays a wealthy and eccentric business man bound to a wheelchair who says what he wants and gets whatever he asks for. Retired from his coal mining business, his days now consist of toying with his asskissing moneyhungry family who secretly are waiting for him to die, and being with his sexy live in housemaid (played by The Wonder Years' Olivia D'abo, whom I did not know was British, not to mention the daughter of Doo Wa Diddy's Manfred Mann). Led by the hilarious and unfortunately late Phil Hartman in top form, the family take turns accomodating Douglas and verbally assaulting him in private. The movie takes a turn when they decide to call Douglas' favorite nephew, played by Michael J. Fox, who has moved away to get away from his gold digging cousins, in order to cheer up Douglas. Fox, and his wife, played by the charming Nancy Travis, are the only ones who aren't after their uncle's money. Or are they? With many twists and an ending to die for, this movie is my pick for the most underrated comedy of the 90's. See it!",
         "This comedy from the same director that brought us My Cousin Vinny is certainly a bit of a buried treasure. A well-cast, surprisingly effervescent production that has a good number of genuine laughs. Kirk Douglas is an aging millionaire, whose immediate family is comprised of a loathsome greedy horde of bloodsuckers who spend their time in outrageously sycophantic displays while trying to undercut their competition. Their plans hit a snag with the arrival of sexy pizza delivery girl Olivia D'abo who stays on as Douglas' caretaker. To attempt to ameliorate her influence, the clan seeks out Douglas' favorite estranged nephew - a down-on-his-luck bowler played by Michael J. Fox, who does his best to rise above the shenanigans, but finds himself drawn ever further into the melee. If the film has a major weakness, it is that once the family unites to draw Fox into the game, the entire group of them (including Hartman, Jere Burns, Colleen Camp, etc.) suddenly operate as one mind rather than continuing to undermine each other. It would have been far more intriguing to see each specific relative continue with schemes of their own. Otherwise, the film is a lot of fun. Douglas is hilarious as the millionaire, who knows all too well what the family is doing and always seems one step ahead of their foolishness. Phil Hartman is a deadpan delight as the primary golddigger, who spends his time disparaging his relatives to Douglas with acid backhanded \"compliments\". Director Jonathan Lynn is acerbically funny as the put-upon butler and D'abo is suitably sexy as the wild card in the mix. The usually capable Nancy Travis is stuck with a largely humorless role as Fox's well-meaning girlfriend and the voice of reason in the film. Truthfully, her character could have been omitted or combined with the D'abo character without any deleterious impact. Fox himself has rarely been better outside of the Back to the Future franchise. This is one of his most appealing and consistently amusing performances. I would also be remiss in not mentioning his pleasantly surprising extended nude scene. I mean, WOW! Who knew? Sharp-eyed viewers will figure out the ending, but it does not make it any less satisfying. A film comedy that definitely needs to be rediscovered and re-evaluated by a new crop of viewers. They will definitely be rewarded.",
         "Greedy has taken some of the plot situations in the Paramount classic If I Had A Million and carried them to incredible heights. It has a whole string of good performances topped off by one of the last performances by Kirk Douglas before he had his stroke. Kirk plays the Richard Bennett part here, the millionaire who doesn't like almost all of his relatives, but gets a certain sadistic joy in seeing them perform like trained seals, trying to stay in his good graces. The only honest one of them is one of Ed Begley Jr.'s young sons who is just like that kid in If I Had a Million who started playing that record of I'll Be Glad When You're Dead You Rascal You. Unlike Bennett, Douglas does not decide to drop parts of his fortune on eight random strangers. He just keeps putting his family through their paces until they decide to dig up Michael J. Fox, a nephew he actually liked when he was a kid. Fox is a second string professional bowler who's got a TV producer he's involved with, Nancy Travis. The two of them invade Douglas's three ring circus of relatives and get put through their paces also. All the family is against Douglas's 'nurse' Olivia D'Abo who the family is afraid will get the whole inheritance. Greedy is a nicely paced amusing comedy which I think most of us can identify with. I know I've had a relative or two I can't stand either, but am forced to be nice to for a variety of reasons. The relatives are all greedy, but Douglas is one sadistic creep as well. I'd catch it the next time it's on the tube.",
         "I suppose saying that the end of this movie is great gives something away. Then again you don't know what that is so maybe not. The plot of this film has Kirk Douglas dying as all of his relatives try to curry favor and get left his fortune. When every trick in the book fails they call in Michael J Fox as his long lost favorite nephew. Fox is now a down on his luck pro-bowler desperate for the cash the family promises him. Some of what follows is sit-com material, some is highly inspired. The good part of it is that almost all of it is funny. Certainly the film as a whole is not the best thing down the pike, but it has its moments, all of which make this film worth seeing.",
         "I was forced to watch this movie with a friend. I have never heard of it until then. I found out that Micheal J. Fox was in it so I decided to watch it. It started out very different and then I was shocked to see how the family memebers were treating each other. This movie was a comedy, but a drama as well and I loved it. The humor was different, but funny all the same. I really, really liked this film and this is a deffinate purchase.",
         "Greedy tells the simple story of a family who desperately crave their Uncle's (Kirk Douglas) massive fortune.From that simple premise,the script writers and the actors deliver one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen.The Mcteague family,which includes the late Phil Hartman,Ed Begley'JR and Bob Balaban,are one of the most believable families ever committed to celluloid.Let's face it a lot of us hate our families.We hate having family get together's,we sometimes get jealous of each other and try to outdo each other,well that's the kind of family we're talking about.The scenes where the relatives trade insults with each other are hysterical.Michael J.Fox plays another nephew of Joe and gives a typically naturally funny performance.He and Douglas don't share the screen until about half an hour into it,but when they do get together,their sparky banter is consistently funny. I wish they would make more comedies like this nowadays.Most mainstream comedies now seem to be filled with stupid,over the top characters with beyond ridiculous situations.Most of the comedy in this is in the dialogue,although there are some hilarious physical moments but they're never stupid,just laugh out loud funny.The premise is slightly believable because I believe that we all have what it takes to become very greedy individuals,even if we might not like to admit it.Hell,we might not even notice it. Greedy easily ranks as one of my favourite comedies and is a laugh riot from start to finish.And has their ever been a sexier woman on screen than Olivia D,Abo in this movie?",
         "Wow.This is possibly the most underrated/unknown comedies out there.I was introduced to it by a friend because he knew I was a massive Michael J.Fox fan and I was laughing my head off within the first few minutes.I think it took a good 15 minutes of the film before Fox came on screen,which I was surprised about,but it didn't matter in the slightest because of the other actors/actresses in the cast,playing his relatives.The late great Phil Hartman (The Simpsons)is one of the many familiar faces who plays a member of the family who are desperate to get their hands on their great uncle Joe's money,played with relish by an old Kirk Douglas in one of his last roles.They are desperately trying to stop the old man from leaving his fortune to his beautiful nurse Mollie.But not only do the Macteague family want what they think is rightfully theirs,they also hate each other,so brown nosing is taken to an whole new level, as is backstabbing and it is a joy to watch.This was one of the film's Michael J.Fox made when he was having personal problems because of his cruel twist of fate with Parkinson's disease,but looking at his performance in the film you'd never have known it.The highlight of the film is definitely the dialogue (scripted by the writers of City Slickers)especially in the scenes where the relatives are trying to get one over on each other.And a special mention has to go to director Jonathan (Yes Minister)Lynn's unfussy direction.There's no jerky camera-work or quick editing to highlight the performances.He didn't need to.He just pointed the camera at them and let them do their thing.And the lack of intrusive music in many of the film's scenes was refreshing as well.If you're a fan of comical films that have an edge and have a range of amusing characters,this wickedly funny film is highly recommended."
