      "overview": "Did Adolf Hitler survive WWII and live on under an assumed identity? Norwegian researcher Skule Antonsen sides with Spanish documentary filmmaker Idelfonso Elizalde to follow in the footsteps of Adolf Munchenhauser, a Hitler look alike captured by the Allied forces in Berlin 1945. When Munchenhauser is released from Camp Rebecca in 1946, a secret prison camp in the Nevada Desert, he decides to stay in the U.S. Skule digs into Munchenhausers life and hears a lot of stories, but none of them reveal his real identity. Is it possible that Adolf Munchenhuser really was Adolf Hitler? As Skule digs deeper for the truth it becomes clear that there are powerful forces that will do anything to stop him.",

         "Surprisingly, to my knowledge, there have been no conspiracy satires postulating Hitler's suicide in the bunker being a hoax - this concept is such a golden opportunity for vicious, biting and black gallows humour. Sadly, that opportunity is largely frittered away. This film looks more like a beta-promo proof-of-concept slap together with which to entice investment for the real thing. Just a bunch of set pieces barely held together by a stream of thought, occasionally losing coherence altogether. It is a very poor product and of marginal interest only. Really, I would like to see the creators pull it - learn from their mistakes, fine tune it, invite some devious writers, or even float for public input, and craft this properly. It is a crying shame seeing something like this so sloppily done.",
         "I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I think the subject matter was very compelling and certainly gave me some food for thought. The humor is great , excellent script , great direction and acting. I highly recommend this film with a fine glass or two of sweet red wine.Definitely worth seeing. Bring a friend. Filmed some 5 years ago in various locations . The camera work is very interesting with interesting angles and the editing is very intelligent and sharp as well. This film should be rated among the top films of the year I definitely intend to get the word out to all my friends and associates that they need to check this movie out."
