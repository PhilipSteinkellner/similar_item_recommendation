         "content": "This is another old John Wayne classic that, despite being a bit of an oldie, is still so much fun to watch. Being made as late as 1973 it is one of the later works of John Wayne. I quite like these later works where he is often playing a grumpy old hero.\r\n\r\nThis movie is a good classical old western with a decent enough chunk of humor. It starts off fairly hilarious when Lane punches his friend for bringing a guy along who \u201ccould not take orders\u201d.  The continued muttering and bickering between Lane and his two old war-buddies is one of the things that makes this movie so fun to watch.\r\n\r\nThe story is a fairly simple one. A widow of a bank robber hires Lane and his friends to track down half a million in gold that said widow\u2019s husband stole and hid. Naturally there are other parties searching for the gold. The entire movie centers around Lane & Co though with the other parties just being kind of \u201caround\u201d which is perhaps a bit unusual. Apart from a few close-ups of a Pinkerton agent played by Ricardo Montalban (who of course will always be Khan for us sci-fi fans) and who has no major part to play until the end, we never really see the bad guys in any detail. They are just a bunch of men on horses riding over the country side or shooting at our heroes.\r\n\r\nAs is often the case with American western movies the landscape and scenery is also a contributing factor to the enjoyment of the movie. The choice of the abandoned train wreck in the desert was an interesting, a bit unusual, and visually pleasing one. I have to say that the \u201ctown\u201d where the train arrived with Lane and where the final fight took place was a wee bit disappointing though.It looked like three scattered houses and a water tower.\r\n\r\nThe ending was just as hilarious as the beginning. Actually more so. I just loved it when Lane rode after the train and in answer to his friends question explained that he was going to rob a train.\r\n\r\nThis was some very enjoyable 90 minutes indeed.",

         "Mrs. Lowe (Ann Margret) is the widow who enlists the help of Lane (John Wayne) in finding a gold shipment that had been stolen five years ago� In that time ten men rode away with half a million in gold� The fellow that was running the show figured they better hide it until things cooled off� So he took the Fargo box and rode south into Mexico� He had the misfortune of getting shot� But before he died, he told his wife�the mother of his little boy� where the gold was� But his widow decided to get the gold, return it to the train company for a $50,000 reward, and clear her husband's name� The reason: she doesn't want her kid growing up thinking his old man ran around robbing trains� In mid way, and as 'gold has a way of bringing out the larceny in all of us,' Wayne, with his old-times pals and two young helpers, find themselves followed by mysterious riders who also want the buried loot� \"The Train Robbers\" features plenty of gorgeous vistas, from rocky scrub to a sea of rippling sand dunes� Also Wayne delivers one of his most memorable lines addressing Margret, 'I've got a saddle that's older than you are, Mrs. Lowe.'",
         "I find The Train Robbers to be a surprisingly under-appreciated western. The more times I see it, the more I appreciate it myself. Sure, the feel and the look may be old-fashioned for its time but I don't care. Kennedy, Wayne and the rest of the group have obviously settled to make a fine basic western romp, not a new-styled masterpiece, and have reached the goal with very satisfying results. There can be seen a few little touches of Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West' (the first scene of Ben Johnson waiting at the train station), Siegel's 'Two Mules for Sister Sara' (a sister Sara-type treatment of the female character) or Hill's 'Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid' (the pursuing gang of riders). It also brings to mind Peckinpah's 'Ride the High Country'. But after these slight touches it's always back to the good old' Wayne stuff and I have nothing to complain about that. With the music underlining heavily the handsome photography makes some highly iconic and beautiful pictures. There are frames that look a lot like classic western paintings. The nature and the people are seen beautifully during the long ride through deserts, rivers and storms. Sometimes it almost feels like watching 'Easy Rider' of the Wayne generation on horses. \"Let's go to Mexico.\" The action works fine like it always does when these old times film pros have been on the job. The men might be saddle-weary, but still gutsy enough and well worn like good saddle leather. You can tell the experience and good times as well from their voices. There is also a lot of warmth shining out of them, specially from Wayne's side. Ann-Margret has no real competition being the only woman in the picture. Besides \"sticking out from the right places\" she holds up pretty well especially with Wayne, who easily blew other actors aside with his strong presence on the screen. With appropriately ironic note to its end the whole raid for the lost gold serves as a very good early seventies western and a decent one in Wayne's canon.",
         "I have never seen a John Wayne movie that I didn't enjoy, although some of the very early stuff was a little hammy. The Duke always gave his best in all his films. Who cares about little little blips here and there. The Good guy always wins, and usually gets the girl. This film excels because of the way it leads the viewer down a dirty dusty path, with a wonderful twist just where you don't expect it. As always - Excellent Scenery, even the animals have their own little cameos. There is plenty of drama, and enough suspense to keep up concentration levels There are the usual little two way quips, and enough dialogue to paint a clear enough background to the key characters. Ben Johnson is his usual dry character, Rod Taylor plays a likable delayed adolescent, Ann Margret fills her part amply! Good Fun - Plenty of Bangs - Well Cast - Memorable Quips. Nobody minds a bit of repetition if it works, and contributes to the storyline which it does well.",
         "I was in college when I first saw THE TRAIN ROBBERS. I was already a die hard John Wayne fan. I followed his later career with great interest. Since due to the political climate of the day one was not the most popular individual on a campus declaring the fact that you liked this star's work. I didn't simply declare this fact. I shouted it from the rooftops. I dragged all my friends to see this picture because I felt it both reflected the best of Duke's earlier work and still stayed consistent with the aging hero he was portraying. Burt Kennedy's lean and taut script reminded me of the best of his work on the Randolph Scott and Budd Boetticher westerns of the fifties. The simple yarn of Ann-Margret hiring John Wayne and his crew of Ben Johnson, Rod Taylor,Christopher George, Jerry Gatlin and Bobby Vinton to recover half a million dollars in stolen gold is very simple in it's directness. They are are gunmen who just stay on the right side of the law. If they were japanese they could almost be described as landless sellswords or ronin. They exist simply from job to job. The status quo for Lane John Wayne's character is changed by the presence of the woman. Mrs. Lowe, He finds himself sexually attracted to Mrs. Lane, a woman young enough to be his daughter yet still capable of reminding him of the things he's lost in his life.Ann-Margret's character is curious about Lane who won't or more importantly can't talk about himself. Ben Johnson's character Jesse fills in the the necessary exposition but never tells more than he immediately has to. Burt Kennedy also plays with his audience. In BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID George Roy Hill has his leads chased by faceless men that they eventually are able to identify. In THE TRAIN ROBBERS our crew is chased by nameless men we never get to identify, people who remain throughout the film as a constant unknown quantity. This is a situation I don't recall ever seeing before in an A grade Wayne western. There is a scene toward the end of the film where Mrs. Lowe makes an overture to Lane which he reluctantly rejects. He feels he is too old to have feelings of this nature. The film starts to proceed to what might be considered a predictable conclusion. Burt Kennedy does not oblige. He gives us a surprise ending that totally satisfies on each and every viewing. There are other considerable assets to this project. Dominic Frontiere's score is a rouser. The opening of the film and the first fifteen minutes contain no score at all. All of a sudden we have an expansive score on the par with Alfred Newman's HOW THE WEST WAS WON or Jerome Moross's THE BIG COUNTRY. The only other score Mr. Frontiere ever delivered on a par with this film was Ted Post's HANG'EM HIGH. The other major contributor to this project was William H Clothier superb cinematography. This was the last of his 17 collaborations with the Duke and no movie ever looked cleaner or sharper. I know this film has many detractors. Everyone is entitled to his opinion but I feel this is on the high end of Duke's later work. As for Burt Kennedy I feel he delivered a movie even Howard Hawks would have liked to claim as his own.",
         "Late in his career, John Wayne made quite a few very leisurely films where he just kind of walked through the parts. Of course, considering he was pretty old and had been battling with cancer, it certainly isn't much of a surprise. What is a surprise is that he was, on occasion, able to play some of the roles he played--such as in BRANNIGAN and his final film, THE SHOOTIST. THE TRAIN ROBBERS is such a leisurely romp. Sure, they ride their horses a lot (probably too much, if you ask me), but the action scenes were pretty subdued other than a gunfight here and there and a couple punches--sort of a kinder, gentler sort of John Wayne. This film is about a widow who wants Wayne and his friends to cross into Mexico to rescue some stolen gold and return it for the reward. Along the way, there are a lot of good moments of dialog between those in the party and, not surprisingly, the old professional Ben Johnson came off best in these scenes. While the overall film offered few big surprises, the ending was pretty exciting and for Wayne fans this is a must-see. For others, it's a pleasant enough Western--you could certainly do a lot worse! By the way--Two final comments. Bobby Vinton was in the movie but you'd hardly notice. Also, in one scene, a mule knocks one of them into a huge mud puddle. Only seconds later, the same guy is barely wet at all--an interesting continuity problem.",
         "The film western had already been beaten dead for US audiences by the endless stream of television westerns. The vicious surrealism of the spaghetti western had essentially overwhelmed the clichés of Hollywood. What's a film maker to do? Clint Eastwood successfully made post-westerns by following the cynical, mysterious world-weary character he originated in the Leone films. What did everyone else do? Here's an example. The film starts with a modest imitation of the masterful opening sequence of Leone's \"Once upon a Time in the West\" while some characters wait for Wayne to arrive on a train. When Wayne finally appears the film switches back into Hollywood style. The dialog is largely by the book and the characters are about as interesting as any you would find in an average TV western. The photography is very good but it can't make up for the fact that at least 20 minutes of the film are long boring scenes of John Wayne and his pals riding around on horses against spectacular vistas. Sometimes they are being followed by a mysterious group of hooligans who pass the same vistas, same camera shot! The first 20 minutes of the film has no music but when Mr. Frontiere's orchestra kicks in (during those boring horse riding sequences), we are treated to bombastic western cliché music. Frontiere did some really good soundtracks elsewhere but this pales against much of Ennio Morricone's spaghetti western soundtracks. To the film's credit there are some good sequences and dialog. The scene with a crashed train that's half buried in the desert is neat. And the last scene in the film is funny, almost makes up for the rest of the film. This could have been good but it would have had to be done in the 1950's when the western wasn't so pickled.",
         "I remember when this movie first came out. Most reviews were favorable. Sure, it wasn't in the same class as The Searchers or Rio Bravo, but the main point of the reviewers at the time was that it was refreshing because nothing was what it seemed, what you typically saw in a western didn't happen, and there was the hook at the end of the movie which gave the title a new meaning. Sure there were some poorly delivered lines, a few times you had to suspend your disbelief, but there were moments like Ben Johnson reprising his Oscar winning scene from The Last Picture Show and the Duke talking about the age of his saddle which had a double meaning. Not a great western, but a lot of fun with an ending left to your imagination and without any doubt!",
         "The picture talks about a widow (Anne Margret) who contracts as employer to a motley group of cowboys (Jon Wayne, Rod Taylor, Ben Johnson, Christopher George , Vinton and Jerry Gatlin) to help her retrieve a robbed gold of the Well Fargo in order to delete her late husband's bad name who had previously stolen it . The gold is located on a far desert and they'll have to cross various places until achieve their objective and being pursued by some cutthroats and a detective of Pinkerton agency (Ricardo Montalban) . The highlights of the film are the imposing attack by the bunch of baddies on the train remains where the protagonists are sheltered and , of course , the final confrontation results to be pretty exciting . In the motion picture there is action western , continuous riding , emotion , tension , adventures , relaxed acting and results to be quite entertaining and funny . John Wayne's and Ann-Margret's character names, \"Lane\" and \"Mrs. Lowe,\" are the same as Wayne's and Geraldine Page's characters' names in Hondo . The storyline is simple and plain but the final plot line has an astounding surprise that turns out to be the best part of the movie . Good support cast such as Ricardo Montalban , Ben Johnson , Christopher George , Jerry Gatlin , among others . Director Burt Kennedy wanted to cast Jack Elam as Grady ; however John Wayne would not allow this, because he felt Elam had stolen too many scenes from him in Rio Lobo . Excellent musical score by Dominic Frontiere , author of various enjoyable western soundtracks , thus : ''Barquero'', ''Chisum'' and ''Hang high'' . Cinematography by William Clothier , habitual photographer of John Wayne films , is glittering and impressive , as it is well reflected on the numerous outdoors that are stunning location shots . This low-key pic was produced by John Wayne and his son Michael G. Wayne , proprietaries of the Batjac Productions . The movie was professionally directed by Burt Kennedy , author and screenwriter of a few classic Western mostly performed by Randolph Scott and directed by Budd Boetticher . The flick will appeal to John Wayne fans and western moviegoers . Rating: Nice and good . It's worthwhile seeing.",
         "One of the good, though less talked about John Wayne films that sort of slipped between the cracks of True Grit and Rooster Cogburn, The Train Robbers is a bit light-weight most of the time, but a lot of fun, especially the exciting cat-and-mouse game played out in the final thirty minutes. Writer/director Burt Kennedy wrote some of the best unsung westerns ever. Each of them are loaded with the nuances that almost every modern attempt at the genre seems to lack, things like hard decision making and the hazards of crossing the frontier, stuff that made this and other Kennedy-scripted movies really satisfying. It's great to see the Duke here, riding alongside such great co-stars as Rod Taylor, Ben Johnson, and Christopher George, though Ann-Margaret seems a bit miscast. With her in the movie, you can pretty much guess the final scene way in advance! From the fifties onward, Wayne made a point to cast young teen idols, singers, and up-and-comers in his pictures, like Tab Hunter, Fabian, Ricky Nelson, Glen Campbell, Jeffrey Hunter, and James Caan. With that in mind, the casting of Bobby Vinton still seems like an odd choice, as he was pretty old-school, even for 1973! He's alright though, in his limited role as Wayne's sidekick's sidekick's sidekick!",
         "This is another pretty good John Wayne movie. He leads a small team of adventurers in to Mexico to try and recover what is supposedly gold from a robbery. The widow is played by Ann- Margret and she is the eye candy for this movie and not a bad one at that. She says she wants to return the gold to clear her husbands name. The group goes looking for the gold. They end up finding it but a lot of bandidos show up to try and rob them. There is a lot of killing and explosions and they get the gold home. Here Ann-Margret takes the gold and as she is leaving on the train the guys learn she is just a hooker and is stealing the loot. Ben Johnson and Rod Taylor play two of the side kicks and are very good in their supporting roles. Bobby Vee is the youngster just starting out on the trail of the enforcer and does okay."

         "After the death of her husband, Mrs. Lowe (Ann-Margret) wants to tell the railroad where to find the half million U.S. dollars in gold her late husband, Matt, stole during a train robbery, and clear the family name for her son. Instead Lane (John Wayne) convinces her to retrieve the gold so she can collect the $50,000 reward offered by the railroad for its return. Lane lines up some old friends to assist him in retrieving the gold for a share of the reward. But the other original train robbers have gathered a gang and will try to get the gold at any cost. As they all journey into Mexico in search of the hidden gold they are followed closely by Ricardo Montalban's character, a Pinkerton agent. After a series of adventures and battles they return to Texas with the gold where there is one final battle. The next day Lane and his men put Mrs. Lowe on a train to return the gold and tell her she can keep the reward for herself and her son. As they are walking past the end of the train they meet the Pinkerton Agent who tells them, as the train is pulling out, that Matt Lowe was never married and that Mrs. Lowe fooled them into helping her get the gold for herself.",
