The director and writers here were still pretty unexperienced in terms of movie-making when this came out and it shows. I guess they wanted to come up with a character study here, but in the end it just turns out a rather uninteresting and very slow piece of filmmaking. The lead actress Balibar is more experienced, but, with her French background, German films were sort of new for her as well. Some of the other actors (Hummer, Friedrich, Löbau, Bauer) may be known to fans of German films too. The main character is a stewardess and we watch her struggles in private and professional life. As the film goes on, she ends up in an animal rights group and these parts are probably still the most interesting of the movie, even though they aren't great either. The worst part was probably a random marriage proposal for reasons that one character does not have to go to the army. All in all, this film, is all about the main character's journey to herself, but it's not really a journey you want to watch. Not recommended."],

Florian proposes that he, Ellen and the other woman could all live together, which Ellen doesn't agree with. Ellen walks away from her job. With no idea of what she wants to do with herself, Ellen almost randomly falls in with a radical animal rights group and embraces a new life of political action, drugs and free love. Has Ellen truly embraced a new life, or is she simply reacting to her anger over what happened to the old one?"],
