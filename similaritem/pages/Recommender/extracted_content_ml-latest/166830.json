         "Well-made documentary about the Boston bombing that took place during the Boston marathon in 2013. With tons of video-footage covering most aspects the actual marathon, the bombing and even the chase of the suspects afterwards etc, but it's first and foremost a documentary about the victims and about overcoming a tragedy. Focusing primarily on some of the survivors dealing with the aftermath, not only physical issues such as losing limbs but mental as well and we get to follow them around on a day to day basis as they try to piece their lives back together. It gets very emotional at times and it was a struggle occasionally to hold the tears back. So yeah most definitely worth watching.",
         "I watched this documentary last night and was deeply moved by the courage of the people affected by the terrorist attack on April 15, 2013, at the Boston Marathon. Watching and listening to their personal stories elicited a range of emotions: fear and outrage; sympathy and pride. The filmmakers who put together this documentary were thorough and factual; sympathetic yet never crossed the line into melodrama. The actions of the Boston Police Department, Homeland Security, the FBI and all other government agencies that sorted through the astronomical amount of video and other data (something like 500 terabytes, but I could be wrong on that number) amazed me and filled me with pride. The fact that the officers and agents were able to identify and find the bombers was awe inspiring. So was the fact that everyone transported to a hospital lived. I think 90 people were transported to area hospitals within 30 minutes of the bombing. The bombing was religiously motivated and that's extremely frightening to me. There have been religious wars for thousands of years but now it's on United States soil. I highly recommend this documentary to everyone.",
         "I really enjoyed movie, not only because It was well made but also it had a full visual and real documents from the event. It was surprising to me, that the capture of those criminals was so difficult. In my country we only knew about the bombs and the fact that they were captured and the wife who didn't say anything. I hope you enjoy the movie. Regards."
