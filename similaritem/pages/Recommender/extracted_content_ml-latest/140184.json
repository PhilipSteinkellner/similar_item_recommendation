         "Several people wake to find themselves in a vacant run down hospital with no idea how they got there or why they are there. Now if you have never seen any movies before in your life you'll probably enjoy this. Chances are however you've seen something like this before. I have seen Devil's Seed:2012 which is by the same people and I enjoyed it. This one is nothing like it. As the film progresses we learn more as to where they are and why they are there which you can predict right away. They spend 50 screen minutes just looking for an exit. In some parts I thought watching people go through a revolving door would be more entertaining. Horror fans won't enjoy this one. There is no real violence but there is nudity. There is a couple of cool looking demons but some look like Charlie Brown's Christmas tree as well! Another problem with this one is all the scenes are in the dark save for a few flashbacks. The very end will have you rolling your eyes. All in all I was disappointed with this one. This is a film where ten minutes after you watch it you forget you even watched it. That's why I did this review five minutes after I watched it. 5/10.",
         "Sure I've seen plenty with this subject on, yet somehow, Kingdom Come seemed better than most and if not, at least more heartwarming. What makes this a decent production compared to say, Devils's Dozen per example? Well let's see, the acting, looked good enough, some of the actors actually knew what they were doing. Is the subject original? No. Is the direction taken on a different road? Again, no. But the effects, were decent enough for what they were supposed to do, they didn't try too hard, they worked with what they had, thus one must appreciate the effort put in it. I hate it when a movie tries to compensate on bad effects, or gore, or nudity. Not the case here, don't get me wrong, you'll get your part of nudity, a little blood here and there, but they are important to the story. Overall, I gave it a 5, quite possibly the film will be graded in time with an universal 4.2-4.4 but I wanted to give it a little push. Possibly has to do with the fact that expected very little of it. Anyway I am pleased with it. Of course for better productions on this gender try Devil or Dead End. Both movies get a solid 7.5-8 on my books. Cheers!",
         "This is what happens every Halloween - an abundance of really bad horror films. 'Kingdom Dumb' is another one of those 'a group of strangers, probably already dead, awake in a strange place.' Instead of keeping us guessing for a total of thirty seconds, the director just threw this group of idiots in an abandoned hospital, letting us know right away where the twist was heading. The acting is dreadful, although whenever you have a guy playing Satan, whether it be Al Pacino or the guy in this pile of crap - you should expect some overacting, since the part usually calls for it. So, he ends up being the one character in the film somewhat tolerable. Random Ramblings of a Madman: 'Kingdom Dumb' is a horribly dull film - something even the worst horror films should never be.",
         "Now this movie is not one of those with star cast, fancy effects or big ass budgets. With that said I think this movie deserves some appreciation with the effort that was put into providing a good plot and twists. Even with the many flaws in acting during the first couple of minutes, it improved to some extent as the movie progressed. Truth be told, I nearly quit watching after just the first five minutes. I only continued watching so I can see how worst the acting gets, however it turned out I was in for a little surprise. After the introduction of all the characters, my perception of the movie changed. I was wondering who was who, I was also trying to predict what would happen only to fail. That encouraged me to watch more and more until the ending, where I witnessed one of the most unique endings to a horror movie I have watched in while. If you ask me this movie doesn't provide star actors or super star acting. But what it does provide is a good plot with a seriously unpredictable events making for an entertaining movie.",
         "I give this movie props for trying to make unusual demon creatures. They were kinda creepy looking and it was a refreshing look. That's about it. I personally think this Movie was made by a pack of hardcore Christian anti Abortionists?. To even comprehend that you can get 'redemption' for being a hardcore Pedophile or pushing your daughter down the stairs cause she was dating a Black guy and then letting him to go to jail for the murder?. But its an absurd idea to get redemption cause you had an Abortion because you are the ultimate sinner. Come on. Pushing an Agenda much? Please ban these people from making a movie ever again.",
         "Seems to have a solid premise, and it kept me interested for about half an hour. Then the pace dropped and the dialogue fell apart, with lots of irritating Q&A and some lines that any actor would be ashamed to deliver. Apart from the guy who plays the devil with a double helping of blue cheese: \"enduring that kind of pain must be unbearable - mwahaha\". Yes, that bad. You end up with cardboard characters in a dumb morality play. Plus the premise becomes confused because the victims start out dead, but then two are alive. Plus those stupid demons. Not only is there nothing new in this, it deteriorates so badly that you can sense the cast losing all conviction. It is worth waiting to find out why the little girl is in the movie. But too many things have gone wrong by that stage. Totally ham-fisted.",
         "The actors weren't horrible (except for the main villain, he was pretty awful) and the cinematography is, technically speaking, decent enough for a super low budget film, but if you've seen many horror movies, then you'll figure out the \"twist\" almost immediately, because we've seen this many times before and done a lot better than this. The creature makeup isn't the worst I've seen, but it's pretty weak by modern standards. Oddly enough, most of the gore is either obscured or off-camera entirely, yet there is a pretty healthy dose of nudity and plenty of rape scenes and implied pedophilia. As it stands, it's a mediocre and highly derivative movie, without a memorable scene to its name, but what really makes it a stinker are the unpleasant religious undertones. Personally, I can't ignore the fact that this movie suggests that not only are pedophiles and serial rapists/killers able to be redeemed by simply repenting at the last minute, but that they're also on equal moral ground with people who have had abortions. It's a disgusting message and I can't stand for it.",
         "At first I wasn't expecting much from this film. It seemed initially to be a clone of the 'Saw' films, but it proved to become much more than that. A group of ably acted, abrasive characters wake up in an abandoned building with no memory of how they got there. As the films rolls on, we become aware that they all have grim stories to tell; their flaws are many and it appears they may even have ended up in Hell \u2013 especially as one of their number Daniel (Jason Martorino) is revealed as major villain with an assortment of partially successful demons (thankfully untouched by CGI). Having cast the cultured-sounding Martorino, I question the wisdom of then giving him lines like 'just kill the mother-f***** already' which sound unconvincing. And yet his performance is otherwise very good \u2013 and so is that of the little girl Ceilia (Ellie O'Brien) who manages a potent performance even when given some punishing lines. A very enjoyable film.",
         "Reasons for bad ratings: Any horror/thriller fan, like me, will immediately figure how the story will be in the first 10 minutes. The plot components are very commonly seen in many other old movies. Also, I don't recommend atheists to watch this movie. Like many, this is yet another movie carrying hidden Christianity values. Why I think it deserves a good rating: It's actually a well-made movie. I am not bothered by a story with an ending easy to guess, as long as it's well developed towards the ending. The actors are not the best but they did really descent jobs. I hope I will see Jason Martorino in more movies. I can see his potentials. Conclusion: This is a good casual horror movie choice if you don't watch horror movies heavily. Plus it's free if you have Amazon Prime.",
         "Very low budget and very amateur actors doesn't necessarily mean a bad movie. This is the case, the script isn't bad at all, the budget doesn't give more options and the actors make a very good job. It's a scary and predictable movie, but it has good qualities. I agree you'll not see a big movie with great special effects but it's much more entertainment than a lot of high budget movies. Congratulations to the Director, Producers and Actores. It's like someone has an idea for a movie and had the guts to do it. The actors are obviously amateurs but make a very good job, better than much of the Hollywood stars. You must see this movie if you like horror movies.",
         "This movie was surprisingly good which was quite a pleasant surprise. I liked the 'gatekeepers', they were pretty cool, and the effects were good for the low budget type movie. I must admit that out of all the 'people wake up in a building not knowing how they got there' horror movies I've seen (and that is a LOT), this was definitely among the superior ones... yeah so we got the point early and the movie's ending was predictable but it was still a pretty good flick. The pacing and the story progression kept one from getting bored. I didn't like the stereotypes presented but that's just me. Overall the movie is worth watching at least once.",
         "If you've ever seen a mega-church Halloween hell house you know exactly how this goes. Except for the boobies and f-bombs, I can easily imagine this being shown to the church youth group. They should really consider making a nudity free cut for the church circuit. The monster costumes were surprisingly good practical effects. Yeah, it is obviously humans in costumes, but it still looked better and more \"real\" than the terrible CGI you get in a lot of low-budget films. Props for that. The setting was pretty good too. It was believable as a dilapidated abandoned hospital. The lighting was sufficient to see what you needed to see. The acting was not very good, but that is par for the course with low budget horror movies. Pretty much made-for-TV quality acting. The dialog was clumsy. Especially the swearing. The swearing was really inauthentic and a bit random, as though written by someone who doesn't swear but decided a movie about \"bad people\" needed swearing. A basic morality play. You probably won't find it scary unless it is the first horror movie you've ever seen though. It is more concerned with pushing a moral than in being frightening or entertaining.",
         "Kingdom Come (2014) Written and directed by Greg A Sager is a Canadian film, filmed in London Ontario and Canada, One would not know this because most of the action takes place in an abandoned industrial site, one with no windows or exits. Spoiler Alert ahead as I am about to talk about the movie. This isolated building is where the ten main members of the cast seem to wake up. The leads, Sam and Jessica, played by Ry Barrett and Camille Hollett-French, have no idea where they are, or how they got there, Nor do any of the other members of the cast. \"Pulling together as a team\", is not in the picture. Each of the diverse individuals, seem to drift to their own fate. We find that each person we meet, has a past to answer to, and that is what this movie is about. It is clear, even by the title,\"Kingdom Come\" That they are all being judged. Some of the crimes committed are heinous; Rape, Murder and Molestation, others seeming less so. We are introduced first to the sinners, and then to their sins. Running the underworld is, \"The man in the blue suit\" played by Bruce Turner. He knows whats going on, and in my opinion tends to smirk too much, The Director at the helm keeps everything in place; The Demon effects are good as are the \"Gatekeepers\". The gore factor, that could easily have gone over the top, is held tastefully in check, The violence effective, without being excessive. Production values are good all around, from the editing, set design, and cinematography, with a workable Score by Aaron Gilhuis Here we have a paradox, a morality tale in the guise of a Horror film. A somewhat serious discourse on the nature of forgiveness and redemption. I like to see Justice done, and as it turns out, except for the enigmatic last ten seconds, this film delivers. I like the way it cleverly brings these souls together, as revealed in the conclusion. There are no accidents. I was also happy to read in the end titles that, \"No demons or gatekeepers were hurt in the making of this movie\". Eight out of Ten Righteous stars.",
         "Greg A. Sager directed paranormal horror \"Kingdom Come\" brings spirituality to the front of horror story telling.The plot sets up a group of strangers waking in a creepy location with no exits, temporary amnesia and something stalking them. It is a classic framing device that has the \"dying conscience facing retribution in limbo\" scenario playing out in macabre and horrific melodrama. Okay I know that I just did a \"spoiler\" no-no but the story concept is obvious from the start in \"Kingdom Come\", and because often times movies that play this curious spiritual situation out can be boring, I want that out of the way because this film is actually interesting, entertaining and creative. Once that manifestum is dealt with then it opens the story up to be enjoyed for the character developments, chilling aspects of horror, and back-story reveals. All of which relies on writing, directing and creativity at the most basic ability. \"Kingdom Come\" does a pretty good job shedding the tiresome cliché , and gives a nice, creative, story. The cinematography and direction Sager and his team gives us is a strong, visual nightmare, that is captivating. The acting, at times gets choppy, but for the most part the cast bring these characters to life with real emotion. On the surface they seem like 2 dimensional characters but during the course of their journey, the dimensions to these people's individual stories get deep, dark and affective. That is why I hint to the nature of \"Kingdom Come\" concept, because the real gem of this film is the journey and revelation of character offered within. The situations are creative, disturbing, and relative to the underbelly of global social constructs. The special effects and overall environment of \"Kingdom Come\" is that of \"horror attraction\" on steroids. The location, haunting nature, and dark subject matter push the \"soul facing death\" scenario beyond redundancy and into terrifying grounds. The antagonist and his companions are expected evil aspects that could seem cliché or transparent, but in this set-up work perfectly to really keep the story arch solid, fluid, and macabre. \"Kingdom Come\" is a morality tale, and the creature effects and scene designs really amp up the chilling nature of the story. The sound effects don't really offer anything more than the ability to really solidify the macabre nature of the film, and tense atmosphere. The sounds and instrumental are what you would expect them to be in a story like this. Overall, \"Kingdom Come\" is a great example of how a concept, no matter how obvious it seems, can be elevated to something entertaining. I enjoyed the basic, atmospheric effects, the characters developments and journeys, and the creature effects. The story arc is solid with real attention to getting as much substance in this film without being boring or preachy. The ending is a bit of an expected let-down, but I have never found any film that uses this concept to be surprising or \"go out with a bang\". Still the journey and disturbing character journeys are what really make \"Kingdom Come\" a film worth watching.",
         "Dreary, uninteresting low-cost supernatural set-up of a group people waking up in a abandoned asylum with no way out, but why are they there and what links everyone together? One or two nasty scenes with some decent looking effects (although the demons looked somewhat makeshift, if original), but all too predictable and dumb in its delivery to be effective. The build-up is not particularly captivating either, as we watch the characters bicker, whine and shout at each other, as they get picked off one by one as past secrets come out of the shadows to destroy them, or maybe not. It's all about the choices and redemption. Which path you choose determines your fate. When the twist arrived with its reveal of this nightmarish playground it had me groaning... so did the ending. The acting wasn't any great shakes either. In a way I thought it bought it down, as it was a film that seem to rely more on its acting and story dynamics (which where weak) than the visual action.",
         "When the movie first opens up, you have the feeling that this is going to be an updated modern version of Saw. But, you soon get the idea that it may also just be another cheesy horror flick when people are stuck in a maze full of trickery. I did like the few twists that it had in it. Although, there were several racial clichés, and horror movie clichés in it. But, once you get about 3/4 the way through the film, the pieces start to come together. However, there is one actor in particular that you don't really know what happened to them, and what their fate might have been within the \"other\" world. I liked the story line once it was revealed, but I didn't agree with how the film ended. It really didn't make to much sense at all, and could have easily of gone a different direction. I do recommend this movie, and also suggest that you pay close attention to the story line. The one thing that I absolutely hated was the makeup FX in the film. It was weak and childish, and could have been much better.",
         "Kingdom Come tells of a group of strangers that wake up inside an isolated hospital not knowing how they got there (and no, they don't find a cassette player). There's a few adults and one child among the ones trapped in this building and they want to find a way out, but as they try to find a way out there are images or sins from their past that come back to haunt them. The movie dabbles into religion but given it is supposed to be a horror movie \"sins\" like this can be forgiven, I found it entertaining, the pace was okay and some twists at the end were rather shocking and some were over the top. People tend to forget not every movie has to be a masterpiece to be enjoyed, especially in the horror genre. I wasn't looking for an Oscar worthy movie, I simply went looking for a creepy and entertaining horror movie and I found it.",
         "A man is involved in a fatal car crash but escapes unscathed. Next thing he is in a darkened building unable to remember how he got there. He is not the only one, there is a small group of disparate individuals including a young girl. If you've seen this type of film before you will realise there are only two explanations. The first is of the terrestrial kind, a bizarre experiment or some such. The second is that this is either Hell or Purgatory. In case you still have any doubts as to which is the most likely, the clue is in the title. Any remaining shred of doubt will be dispelled at around 45 minutes when having split from the group, one of their number meets three naked women. Why is he not overjoyed to see them? Because he recognises all three, being a serial rapist and murderer. Now we have established this, what is the point of the rest of the film? Well, there is a spectacular twist, one that clearly indicates not everyone is beyond redemption.",
         "Sam Becker finds himself in an abandoned hospital-like building without knowing how he got there. He runs into Jessica Martin who also has the same problem. They find a little girl Ceilia Scott. Sam wakes up from a dream about him being in a car accident to find the group has grown with a bunch of people who also don't remember how they got there. Each one is confronted with their past. This is a horror indie. The setup is interesting but nothing too original. It's an abandoned haunted house story. However, it's not scary and it's not dramatic. The characters aren't interesting and neither are the actors. It actually gets quite boring. The jump scares aren't scary. It's not dramatic because none of the actors are interesting enough.",
         "**Contains spoilers I'm not even sure why I watched it to the end. Bad acting, badly written stereotypes, obtuse dialogue, a plot that was SO predictable, I felt like my intelligence was personally insulted by the writers. I think this movie was made for 5 year olds. Seriously. Here are some things you'll have to be an idiot NOT to figure out right away: that the whole thing would end up being a near death experience, that the guy who showed up out of nowhere and seemed to instigate the others would turn out to be evil, that the little girl *dressed all in white* (oh, please!) would turn out to be both on the side of good *and*Jessica's aborted kid, that Sam was the one who killed Jessica's husband. By the way, what kind of pro-life bullshit is it to be damned for having an abortion??? The others were murderers, rapists, pedophiles.... You think having an abortion is as awful as raping a child?? Really? I don't have much more to say, other than... No. Don't waste your time with this ridiculous excuse for a movie. I'd rather watch The Room. At least that was entertaining in its awfulness. Kingdom Come just left me with a headache & a urge to throttle the film makers.",
         "Awakening in an abandoned hospital with no memory, a group of people find the area haunted by ravenous demons attempting to help them see the errors of their past and must find the meaning of their imprisonment before they're all killed. Overall this one here was quite a decent enough if slightly flawed effort overall. One of the better facets of this one is the fact that there's a really insane atmosphere present in this one, almost right from the start as there's a rather imposing presence throughout here that keeps this one going along rather nicely. The fact that this one continually utilizes the never-ending corridors that lead to nowhere and a general sense of time-displacement that traps them within the building taking far longer to get to certain areas than they really should carries the creepiness level throughout here really well as the fact that there's a generally uneasy tone that establishes which the film works really well with. That, coupled with the general darkness and unknown forces at play within it tend to cause this one some really good times as well when it finally gets to the action scenes which are incredibly fun, as the encounter with the rapist from his previous targets is quite fun, the daughter coming to torment the father is rather creepy and there's certainly plenty of fun in the final half as the devious figure and his deformed, demonic henchmen continuing to chase the group throughout the hospital makes for some really fun stalking and slashing here when it comes to keeping the figures in the shadows, using the surroundings nicely and making sure that there's plenty of graphic deaths and fun dished out in these scenes that it makes for a great time overall. Still, there's a few problems here in that this one mainly uses for its' story as it's once again the same cliché of the characters involved in another incident out-of-time affecting their struggles within the film currently, as again the ploy of a car accident is used to signal this. It's done to death and isn't very interesting when it focused on the rather thrilling aspect of the demonic hospital that could've carried this along nicely. The only difference here is the film's other big flaw in the use of morality to appease everything, which comes out of nowhere and doesn't affect the rest of the participants so it tends to make it seem completely contradictory to what happened before. Still, this one was quite fun overall. Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Full Nudity, children-in-jeopardy, Rape and heavy themes of child sexual abuse.",
         "Throughout the early portion of the movie you definitely get the feeling this is going to be like one of the Saw movies with them all trapped in a building with no way out and not knowing what to do and then you start to see various characters being confronted about a drug habit, about unintentionally killing their kid over racism and so on. It had some Saw-like story telling for sure but then we got into religion and good vs evil on a higher level than just some man handing out punishment like you see with Saw. The ending was also quite interesting in that the girl was an angel of God or greater but also was that lady's daughter that I think she may have aborted at some point in her life as a teen. That was a very powerful moment when the girl said her mother was forgiven because in the Catholic church that is something that is no forgiven so it makes you think again about what religion was inspiration for this movie. There was the Devil character but is there not the Devil in other religions? Also at very end of the movie to see this was all part of purgatory or something similar was interesting. The main character, Sam Becker, had caused all these people to meet because he caused this massive car accident. Now will he and that lady, Jessica, live or die? Who knows. That isn't the point of the movie anyway. It is all about asking forgiveness of sins, retribution and how that can cause you to sin and so on. I didn't give this movie a score yet and may never will as I am not sure how to rate it. I think the acting was decent but not the best it could be with actor Jo Jo Karume at times early not seeming as convincing as he should be as the tough guy and his lines could have been delivered better so you could knock a point off there or at max. two points for. So how does one give this movie a score of 8 out of 10 or greater? Sometimes I hate scoring systems because you want to give a movie a score you feel it deserves but you may get ripped to shreds for doing so. So again no score given to this movie for now by me but it is definitely worth watching. Oh and one last thing let me say that the creatures that worked for the Devil or whatever were kind of cool looking. I like the way they acted on screen also. There was no CGI for these creatures and it shows that sometimes it isn't needed. Now with me posting this as a review I had to give it a score and so I gave it an 8. The only thing wrong with the movie was a bit of the acting at times. I could not think of other things to knock the score down for.",
         "The movie opens with questions and fear of the unknown. Where are our characters and what sort of craziness have they gotten into? Oh wait no you'll figure it out in about 30 seconds because the writers spell it out for you. Every single twist and character development is nicely packaged with a lovely little bow leaving nothing to your imagination. I do appreciate it when the movie does all my thinking for me so I can go back to checking my email on my smart phone. The movie does have a few positives such as every now and then some of the actors will let their Canadian accents slip out and that's always good for a few laughs. Please let him say sorry a few more times, oh that's adorable. Oh and there is some unneeded nudity which is always a win. In short if these people would have woken up instead on that island from Lost, you would be rooting for the smoke monster the entire time. See ya on the island.",
         "Kingdom Come is based on a cool and somewhat original premise. The acting is kind of shaky but passable. The problem I had with it was that instead of building something creative off of that premise, the filmmaker merely gives us a dime-a-dozen B-grade horror flick. It's really too bad, because the film maker here could have made this movie into a really good mind f!@k for the viewers by giving us a tale about sin, redemption, faith, etc. the fact that it (spoiler here!) touches upon the abortion issue was also rather tasteless. As far as the camera work went, is the director aware that Thomas Edison invented something called a light bulb more than a century ago? The film is so dark it's hard to see what's going on at times. Overall, expect to see this movie played at 2am on the SyFy network."
