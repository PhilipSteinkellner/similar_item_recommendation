      "reviews": ["Dana Gould is a bit of a throwback. He's that old school pro who worked with all the greats. Yet, he still seems to fly under everyone's radar. Part of the reason is he has a limited amount of material available. His first album, Fun House, was released in 1998 and he wouldn't have any other releases until this special, in 2009. He has released one special since, I Know It's Wrong, in 2013 (in which he strangely repeats a couple of the gags from this one), but that at the time of this writing has had a limited release on video and is more widely available as an album download. Both feature some great moments and are strong efforts, but neither can compare to the strength of Let Me Put My Thoughts In You. Gould raises to a level few comics have with this release, doing a set that seems slight at first glance, but that really speaks to many larger issues with personal anecdotes and seemingly innocuous observations. His take on marriage and parenthood is the stuff of legend, however, with the attention to detail and willingness to cross any line taking it to another level. Part Bill Hicks, part Lewis Black and part drunken door-to-door salesman. This special is directed by none other than Bob Odenkirk, another comedy pro."],
