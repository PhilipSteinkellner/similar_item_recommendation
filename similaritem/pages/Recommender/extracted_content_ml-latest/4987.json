         "Oh boy do I ever enjoy this movie. For some reason I've managed to see it at least once a year since it was released and I never get sick of it and I really have no idea why. Mental disorder, perhaps. This movie redefines camp for post-apocalyptic scifi quest adventure 3-D crap. Peter Strauss and Molly Ringwald are both great in their stock roles--Strauss is refreshingly down-to-earth, so unlike the usual all-knowing megalomaniac space ranger with a girl in every port (his girl is a purchased robot companion, which says things about a guy); Ringwald's whine would give God a headache, but she's got the right proportion of bravado and vulnerability to create a believable, occasionally endearing space orphan. I like the random nature of their search, designed to place them in situations where the production can use up a set or two that might have been intended for some other movie. Plenty of rubbery creatures abound. And the Thunderdome-esque stuff is actually pretty cool--I'm reminded of Leela's test in that Doctor Who episode (something people who like Spacehunter are a plausible demographic to remember). All in all this is a happily-brainless-yet-somehow-lovable piece of space junk and I'm crazy about it. Or just crazy.",
         "Back when I was 12, renting this movie was like popping in the end-all be-all of science fiction, especially since I didn't get to see it at the theater! The credits were funky, the heroic Elmer Bernstein score was sweeping, the dialogue was amusing and the plot was something every 12-year-old boy only wishes he could take part in. After all, what could be more fun than taking your android companion on a simple mission to retrieve 3 female survivors from a destroyed outer space pleasure cruise ship who land on a planet nobody is supposed to go anywhere near? I was game! As Wolfe, the man motivated to rescue the three maidens for some big time \"megacredits\", Peter Strauss is fantastically watchable. I don't know what it is about him as an actor, but he does try to bring some sense and sensibility to a pretty generic role. Joining this little adventure is Niki, played by a very young Molly Ringwald. Sure, she's annoying and a pain-in-Wolfe's rear end, but who else could you see playing her from that time period? One of the cast members of \"The Facts Of Life\"? Also included in the cast is Andrea Marcovicci (too bad her part wasn't a bit longer), Ernie Hudson (who always manages to bring some intensity to his roles whether in a good or \"not so good\" film) and Michael Ironside as Overdog (the opposite of \"Underdog\"?), the baddie. Yes, the film consists of a whole lotta cheese; the dialogue borders on laughable (especially by the dwellers on the planet), the special effects don't quite live up to expectations and the plot revolves around a bunch of set pieces that don't seem to make for a consistent story. Still, you know what? This movie holds a very special place in my heart. Let's face it, folks, they don't make them like this anymore. There's no fart jokes, no nudity, no sex and very little language. What's more, Peter Strauss gets some very funny moments! Upon finally rescuing the three screaming women from Overdog, a frustrated Wolfe shouts at them \"Will you PLEASE shut up? I'm trying to rescue you!\" Haven't we all had a moment when we've wanted to say this very same thing? 8 out of 10",
         "Spacehunter is a film I saw as a child, which has remained at the back of my mind for years. Around the same time, I was watching things like Ghostbusters and Star Trek (The Wrath of Khan), and knew nothing about special effects, budgets or story lines. All I knew was that I liked these films. Having recently obtained a copy of Spacehunter, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it holds up, compared to other classics. Yes, a lot of it is hokey nonsense, but in a GOOD way. Strauss makes a likable rogue, obviously straight from the Han Solo mold, and Molly Ringwald is her usual early eighties cutie. The special effects are fair for the time (though the title sequence leaves something to be desired), and the futuristic 'Mad Max' style vehicles could easily be from a more recent movie. Michael Ironside is almost unrecogniseable underneath prosthetics, but offers a great performance, hampered only by his lack of mobility in costume. I was especially surprised to recognise Ernie Hudson as a supporting character, playing Strauss' ex-buddy. In all, a great film with a few minor flaws. I'm amazed this got no further than it did at the time. One of the few post-Star Wars movies that deserves a sequel (which i'm tempted to have a bash at myself).",
         "I make a point to catch Spacehunter every time it airs (usually after 1 a.m.). It's classic cheese, and I submit there's a place in our moral-cinematic universe for such films. What films? Oh, having Michael Ironside as the villain is a good clue. If I had to define them...films so goofy (yet riddled with neat ideas that only the low-budget creative intellect can conjure) that we harken back to adolescence and think how cool these films would have been/were when we saw them with our junior high pals. Yes, this is MST3K material, but lovingly so, nostalgically so. An ugly duckling that never becomes a swan--never even really gives such a transformation a shot--but one we can groove on precisely because it's so dorky.",
         "Been waiting for this for a long time - as cult classics go it's one of my more memorable adolescent reminiscences. I remember seeing this on the big screen when it was first released. Loved it then, for several reasons: Strauss was capable but cool as the hero Wolf, Molly Ringwald was feisty, mouthy and cheeky as the elfin Nikki, and Michael Ironsides was virtually unrecognisable under his make-up, but still gave Overdog a sinister air of menace and cruelty. Now, 20 years later, I get to see it again, and there are flaws that time has exposed. The effects and the music are very dated. The dialogue is weak in places, and the acting from the minor characters leaves something to be desired. However, it still has a sense of excitement and adventure that many other sci-fi flicks of the 80s now lack. The action is fast-paced, the interaction between the leads is good, and the scenery is suitably dark and barren. 7/10 - it's well worth overlooking the more dated elements in order to uncover the gem underneath.",
         "Humorous enough, and not as bleak as Mad Max series. Good sets, and quirky machines (like Mad Max). Very enjoyable, my pals and I would often go for a few beers, shoot some pool, and then sit back and watch this movie, almost every Friday night. So, OK, it is not particularly cerebral, but good entertainment. This is an all-time great. Dunno why everyone else rates it so low, but there you go.",
         "I saw this in July, 2008 for the first time and was surprised by the amount of mechanical devices and vehicles built for this one. And the attention to detail is higher than many modern productions. A funny thing about making movies in 1983 is your choice of either using miniature models or constructing full scale behemoths. This movie goes for the latter option, which is one of its strengths, almost everything you see is right there and not some blue screened effect or shoddy computer graphics. This investment carries very well still today some 25 years later. It is like watching Road Warrior with all of the bikes, cars and trains and it all looks authentic because its actually there. Speaking of Road Warrior, it must be said that Spacehunter has an apparent look and feel of a post-apocalyptic desert world similar to that of the Mad Max films. Striking are the interesting locations which are thrown at the viewer at a fast pace where new environments show up around every corner during their hunt in the forbidden zone. While short scenes in themselves, they come together nicely in creating the feel of a good adventure movie reminiscent of the Indiana Jones movies. Not sure of the budget here, many things look really nice, some space scenes are awful but very, very short. I've mentioned two series of other films in this review, don't expect to find either one of them in Spacehunter, rather expect to find elements of all of them combined.",
         "I don't know why the other commenters seem to not like it much. This is one of my favorite movies. I saw it in the theatres when it came out and several times on video since then, and the reason I came here was that I was looking around for a DVD with it. The campiness works perfectly fine for me. I very much enjoyed Molly Ringwald and Michael Ironside, and most of the other characters. Overall I can't think of anything I didn't think worked about it. Its very entertaining.",
         "Take star wars, mad max 1, 2, 3, running man, barbarella, and some terry gilliam films, mix them together and you have spacehunter. some of these films were made after this one so it shows some originality. I never get tired of watching this film, i think is because there are no dull moments, its just one great scene after another. Its obviously a light hearted sci-fi and the story isn't exactly complicated but it has lots of good points. there are quite a lot of chuckle moments with the strange speak from Niki and the one liners from the reluctant baby sitter Wolf. The effects are very good and still hold up especially the vehicles, no CGI here! I just like the look of it too the colour filters and locations are great to see. well worth a watch if you like any of the above films.",
         "Spoilers herein. I am often hard on films that do a poor job of creating a world. That's an especially obvious flaw in science fiction movies, especially the space travel variant. So I need to celebrate when one comes along that does do well, even if it is a cheesy project. And this is cheesy. But nearly all of this ilk is, from Star Wars on down, with the only question being a matter of what bothers you and whether there is enough to distract you from the annoyances. This one has four features that allow me to recommend it to you: -- The first and most obvious is the squawking Molly. I have a special fondness for her. She had just done her first film, in which she carried a key role as the Miranda in a humanized \"Tempest.\" I distrust the values of Mazursky, so reject that project -- but its very being involved some considerations of what film is. Molly carried her weight with some pretty intense players. Then she did this, then some well done exploitative kiddiefare. Then, my friends, she turned her back on the trite world of John Hughes -- though it made her a celebrity -- and joined Goddard in a version of \"King Lear\" that has to be one of the most interesting film experiments ever. I am currently waiting to see here in \"Tulse Luper,\" by our greatest living filmmaker. She is not a great craftswoman, but intelligent actresses are so rare you have to note when they come around, even if as a bratty 'Liza Doolittle. -- The original release of this was in 3-D, and really was worth experiencing. The technology is unsatisfying, even in the hands of Hitchcock, but was great fun. -- And it was fun, especially given the extraordinary design of this film. Yes, it all looks hokey, but this is pretty wonderful art nouveau inspired hokum. Its pretty atypical for space designs which tend to be techno. And it is different than the \"Mad Max\" ethic which is punk, boring. This is swoopy, organic and appealing as all getout. Just like Molly, now that you mention it. -- Finally, there is a piece of film iconography in its embryonic stage here. Film is largely a matter of successful images that enter the world and stay forever. One of those images is Robert Redford washing Meryl Streep's hair by a pond. That sensual image has since taken on a life as its own meme. You can see here -- so the legend goes -- where Pollack got the idea. A sweet bit of unlikely film ecology. Those are enough to allow me to pass over all the inadequacies in this. Except one. Science fiction writers have the burden of making things different but similar enough for us to grasp. Here, Niki uses the term \"Brainworked.\" We are supposed to understand it as a notch down toward the primitive in understanding. But think about this. Primitives can talk about why something is, or why you believe what you do. But it is a very specific sophisticated notion to impute a brain that reasons so. That's a notch beyond where we are in everyday life folks, not below. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth w"
