In this case, a thief wants the old-man's treasure and hires a zombie-wrangler to re-animate the waxed up relatives in order to sneak into the mansion and steal the treasure. It's up to the kung-fu fighting vampire hunters to save the day (or night).",

      "synopsis": "Prologue. In 17th century rural China during the Ching dynasty, when a dead body isn't resting in peace, chemical and physical changes can build up, allowing it to leave the grave in the form of a zombie, feeding on the flesh of humans. Over time, the zombie will turn into a vampire. If you are bitten or scratched by a zombie, you can recover. But if you are bitten or scratched by a vampire, you will become a vampire. Only a handful of skilled warriors dared to challenge these mystical demons of the night. This is their story. Master Mao Shan [Ji Chun Hua] and his disciples are out hunting zombies and vampires when they come upon the disturbed grave of a general. Master Shan jumps into the grave to see whether the general's body is still there and to destroy it if it is. No such luck. The general has turned into an immensely powerful vampire with the ability to suck the life and blood from a human without even having to bite him. As the priests fight the vampire, their torches suddenly ignite the methane gas around them, sending the whole area up in flames. Three months later. Master Shan is still missing. Guided by their vampire-detecting compass, four of his disciples -- Wind [Lam Suet], Thunder Ken Chang], Rain [Michael Chow], and Lightning [Chan Kwok Kwan] -- are searching the night for vampires when they come across the Jiang estate. They notice wedding caterers going inside the gates. Master Jiang's son is getting married. Wind, Thunder, Rain, and Lightning follow the wedding caterers inside. Once inside, they are mistaken by the butler for hired labor and put to work, right after being renamed Kung (Wind), Hei (Thunder), Fat (Rain), and Choi (Lightning). Young Master Jiang [Wang Zhen Lin] has been married six times. Each time, his wife has died shortly after the wedding. The morning after this marriage to Sasa [Anya], however, it is Young Jiang who is dead, bitten by a cobra. Master Jiang [Yu Rong Guang] asks the four \"workers\" to remain in his employ and to find and destroy the snake that bit his son. Thunder is most eager to remain. He's seen and fallen in love with Sasa. Rumor has it that the Jiangs are fabulously wealthy and have much gold hidden away somewhere in their house. In fact, even as the wedding was underway, hired robbers were on their way to the Jiang's house, planning to break in and make off with the gold. As they rode their horses through the forest to the Jiang house, however, they were attacked by a vampire. Of the half dozen robbers, only one managed to escape. Dragon Tang [Horace Lee Wai Shing] isn't very happy to see him come back empty handed, for it was he who hired the robbers and he who arranged for his sister Sasa's marriage to Young Jiang. Dragon needs the money to pay off his gambling debts. He's even more unhappy when he hears about the vampire. Now that Sasa is a widow, she wishes to leave the Jiang house. There are many strange things happening there, so she writes to her brother and asks that he please get her out of there. When Jiang learns of Sasa's desire to leave, he assumes she is lonely. You won't be lonely, he explains and shows her how he has preserved her husband in wax. In fact, all the Jiang ancestors have been preserved in wax. And so will you be preserved in wax when you die, Jiang assures her. Sasa swoons. The vampire-detecting compass keeps reading that there are vampires in the area, but so far Wind, Thunder, Rain and Lightning have been unable to find them...until they make their way into the family crypt and find dozens of Jiangs, all perfectly preserved in wax. Could one of these be the vampire, wonders Thunder? While leaning on the wall, Rain suddenly presses a lever that opens a chest filled with gold. They have stumbled on the Jiang fortune. Meanwhile, the butler has sold out to Dragon Tang, giving him information about the Jiang household, the gold, and the waxed ancestors as well as the fact that it was Jiang himself who made up the story about there being vampires around. The butler suggests that Dragon hire the Zombie Wrangler to wake up the waxed ancestors. While all these dead ancestors are hopping around, keeping Jiang busy trying to round them up again, Dragon can simply walk in unnoticed and make off with the gold. After meeting the Zombie Wrangler [Chan Koon Tai] and his chiang shih, Dragon goes along with the plan. Jiang is angry with the four disciples for sneaking a peek at Sasa while she was bathing, and he does a bit of fighting with them until he realizes that these guys are too well-trained in the martial arts to be simple servants. Now the truth comes out. They admit that they are vampire hunters. Jiang scoffs at the idea of vampires in his area and informs them that it was he who made up the whole story about vampires in order to keep the robbers from his door. If they are really vampire hunters and if they can help him eliminate the problems that shadow his family, Jiang says that he will adopt one of them as his godson and heir to the fortune as well as allow him to marry Sasa. Thunder immediately offers himself. Jiang laughs. True to his word, the Zombie Wrangler awakens all the dead Jiangs. Jiang thinks that the vampire hunters have awakened his family in order to create a diversion while they steal his gold. But it's not the corpses he should be worried about...it's the powerful vampire who has suddenly shown up. Thunder grabs Sasa, and the two attempt to flee on horseback, hoping to outrun the vampire. Unfortunately, they take a wrong turn and end up at the vampire's grave. Just as the vampire is about to suck out Thunder's blood, Thunder is hit by water. (Vampires can't see you if you're wet.) Thunder looks up to see Master Shan. Thunder places Sasa in a pool of water, then he and Master Shan jump into a well. Unfortunately, there is no water in the well. Just then, it starts to rain. Meanwhile, Jiang is sitting in the family crypt when he hears Dragon and the butler come in. They are looking for the gold, but Jiang is not about to let them get it. As Jiang and Dragon fight, the butler scoops up the gold, but he is bitten by a gold snake. The vampire shows up and kills Dragon and Jiang. Master Shan and Thunder take Sasa to shelter. While she sleeps, Thunder tells Master Shan that he has just married Sasa. Shan tells Thunder how he's been following the vampire for the past several months. Suddenly, they smell smoke. It's coming from a wound on Sasa's leg. Master Shan concludes that Sasa has been wounded by the vampire and will turn into one herself within the next seven days unless she is treated with coffinwood. Meanwhile, back at the Jiang house, the servant girl Ling [Zou Na] stumbles into the family crypt and comes face to face with the vampire. Lightning protects Ling (he's become sweet on her) as Wind and Rain fight the vampire. Just then, Master Shan and Thunder show up. Master Shan notices that the Jiang zombies have been feeding and will soon turn into vampires unless they are destroyed by exposing them to sunlight. Thunder and Sasa see the vampire and run out into the night where they meet up with Master Shan et al. Shan says that the vampire knows they're looking for him. Thunder orders Sasa to find a safe place in town to hide, then they all go off in search of the vampire. They go to the Jiang crypt. Lightning makes the mistake of touching the gold, which is a trap. A net drops over them. Jiang and Dragon then appear, obviously dead. Jiang tells Dragon that he can have all the gold if he'll kill the vampire hunters. As they fight, the vampire shows up. Master Shan says that the vampire has been feeding on Jiang and Dragon and is now superpowerful. After a long, hard battle, Master Shan blows up the vampire with explosives. Unfortunately, Shan gets blown up, too. Epilogue: Now that the vampire is destroyed, it is time for Wind, Thunder, Rain, and Lightning to go their own ways. Thunder and Sasa are returning to her village. Lightning and Ling are going to move into the Jiang house, now that it's empty. Wind and Rain will be staying with Lightning just until they get jobs of their own. [Original synopsis by bj_kuehl]",

         "Good heavens. Why must every Hong Kong film since CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON be compared to it? That's like comparing Tim Burton's ED WOOD to Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE because they're both in black-and-white! They're both great movies, but it's ridiculous to stand them next to each other because they're so vastly different. To me, Tsui Hark constructed a BRILLIANT homage to the \"hopping corpse,\" and \"demon\" movies of the 1980's and early 1990's while adding some great kung-fu sequences. I see hints of SWORDSMAN, I feel bits of MR. VAMPIRE, I hear parts of IRON MONKEY, I smell A CHINESE GHOST STORY, and it's all done quite well. Wu-shu, taoist warriors, hopping corpses, a creepy nod to HOUSE OF WAX, and silly jokes? Great fun to me! Art-house, said one reviewer? Don't know what art films YOU'VE been watching lately. This movie didn't try anything tremendously fancy or new, it took a lot of things we've seen before and turned out a movie that was more than the sum of its parts. Bad humor? Different humor. Hong Kong humor is usually quite different than American humor...I'm sure a lot of people missed when RAIN, CLOUD, THUNDER, and LIGHTNING (ridiculously stereotypical \"hero\" names) were renamed \"Kung,\" \"Hei,\" \"Fat,\" and \"Choi.\" Put those four words together and it says \"Happy New Year\" in Cantonese. Amazingly funny to us? Probably not. Good for a lengthy chuckle for chinese native? Definitely. Low-budget? Again, have we been so spoiled by movie producers throwing vast wads of cash at American films -- often to cover the fact that a movie is BAD -- that we can't appreciate a film that doesn't try to overachieve, but does what it can with what it has? How quickly people forget CLERKS, EL MARIACHI, etc. But then again, DESPERADO was so much better than EL MARIACHI, yes? Because it had BIG EXPLOSIONS and SEX! It's time people set CROUCHING TIGER up on its own shelf and stop comparing it to movies it bears no similarities to. Wanna say that Zhang Yimou's HERO was an overblown attempt to recreate CT,HD? Go for it, you'll be right. Wanna miss the fun of VAMPIRE HUNTERS entirely by refusing to watch it as its own film? Your choice, and ultimately, your loss.",
         "OK, let me start off by saying that if I hadn't read the other user comments for this film, I wouldn't have taken the time to write this, as I'm busy and if I commented on every film I liked, I'd never get any work done. I read the comments here, in The LA Weekly and on other internet sites- and they were, to sum up, some of the stupidest, snobbiest HK film reviews I've EVER read. Do not, repeat: DO NOT believe the hype. Now, unlike alot of other Hong Kong film fans, I don't care for contemporary action films with cops, drug busts, car chases, etc. I DO like old school 70's Kung Fu; ala Chang Cheh and Liu Chia Liang. I also really like the Hopping zombie/ghost/vampire sub-genre of HK 'horror'. Now, in case you aren't familiar with these- they feature 'vampires' and 'zombies' that return from the grave (Usually due to some sort of improper burial) and hop about (Or in the case in Vampire Hunters- fly about). They are usually opposed by priests- Taoist priests- who use Taoist magic to defeat them. The seminal film in this genre is the mid-eighties comedy/horror masterpiece 'Mr. Vampire'. Now, Tsui Hark's 'Vampire Hunters' plays alot like a much more serious version of Mr. Vampire- basically, the comedic elements usually found in these films are almost non existant in 'Vampire Hunters'. This alone makes it one of the only HK vampire films to play like 'action horror' instead of 'horror comedy'. Now, this distinction alone makes Vampire Hunters worth a look. So ask yourself: Do you want just a good, action packed film? The kind of film you're going to want to hold up to The best 1980s and 90s John Wu stuff? Maybe Ang Lee's 'Crouching Tiger'? Or even non-HK action like James Cameron's Terminator 2? Well if you just want great action, there's like, A THOUSAND good action films out there, ok? If you want something more, something you just DON'T SEE anywhere else- something like, Oh, I dunno... maybe... CHINESE VAMPIRES versus TAOIST WARRIOR PRIESTS??? Well, check out Tsui Hark's 'Vampire Hunters'. It's merely a decent 'action' film and not the best edited, paced, well written or anything else kind of film out there. But, the sum of it's parts simply does not equate the fun action/horror fantasy of the whole. So- if you're a 'norm' who thought Erin Brokavich or maybe the Ocean's 11 remake was good, well stay FAR AWAY from Tsui Hark's Vampire Hunters, it's not for you, you won't get it, understand it's appeal or be able to appreciate it. If you're the kind of person who likes the idea of a Mr. Vampire/Chinese Ghost Story double bill, well, strap yourself in- cause Tsui Hark's Vampire Hunters will satisfy your desire to escape from reality for an hour and a half or so.",
         "Version: English dub If like me, you possess an awesome-sense (like Spider-Man's Spider-sense, only it detects awesomeness instead of danger), you should ignore all the negative for 'Vampire Hunters' and listen to me instead. It isn't an awesome movie, but how can a movie with zombies, vampires, and kung-fu not be somewhat entertaining? In 17th century China, zombies and vampires roamed the lands, feeding on the unsuspecting. A group of martial artists / vampire hunters find themselves employed by a very rich - and very insane - old man who has kept everyone of his relatives preserved in wax and not buried. Apparently it is his family's tradition. So, having generations of potential zombies in your cellar may not be the smartest idea ever, but it takes two to tango. In this case, a thief wants the old-man's treasure and hires a zombie-wrangler to re-animate the waxed up relatives in order to sneak into the mansion and steal the treasure. It's up to the kung-fu fighting vampire hunters to save the day (or night). 'Vampire Hunters' ends up being a more serious version of 'Mr. Vampire'. I don't think I've seen any other HK vampire movie that actually tried to be serious instead of an action / comedy. Unfortunately, the concept of 'serious' is my arch-nemesis. I'd forgive the seriousness if the action was good. I would have expected a better action movie from Tsui Hark, but what am I gonna do? Complain some more? Sure! The action is okay, but poorly edited. Thankfully there is enough to keep someone like me entertained. The special effects aren't all that good, but I've never been one to care about bad special effects. 'Vampire Hunters' is a decent action movie, but really only for anyone interesting in Hong Kong vampire / action movies - 5/10",
         "I think Vampire Hunters is a pretty good movie. Although it isn't breaking new ground, for most american viewers it will seem a little odd that the vampires in the movie are more corpse like than you expect to see, but in most if not all accounts of vampirism in the middle ages and earlier periods vampires were refered to as animated corpses, not strikingly beautiful creatures with tragic stories. So if you're looking to see a decent horror movie will \"realistic\" vampires, this would be worth seeing. Two top notch performances in the film are those of Anya, who plays a young widow, and Zou Na, who plays a servant.",
         "In a number of forums I've seen this film mercilessly trashed, and I'm not quite sure why. Perhaps it's having Tsui Hark's name attached to it, thus giving people the wrong idea about the film as they go into it. While I don't think it's the best film ever made by any stretch of the imagination, Vampire Hunters does serve it's purpose. I was entertained thoroughly, startled a few times, laughed a few times, and spent a great deal of my viewing time in suspense. The one thing you can say about this film is that it's definitely not slow moving! While it does suffer from the lack of in depth characterization that seems to be the downfall of many martial arts films, in general I found the acting to be up to par -provided you watch the film subtitled as opposed to dubbed. The wooden voice acting of the English translators is highly reminiscent of the hilarious goofy bad dubbing of 70s martial arts flicks, and really detracts from the genuine scariness of the vampire scenes. And those vampires! Yikes! Spitting acidic gas, sucking your blood through the air, covered in maggots.... Truly makes ol' Bela seem like a puddytat! It's interesting to see the differences between Eastern and Western vampire mythos. The movie itself is beautifully and imaginatively lensed, the director of photography should be proud. The camera-work zooms and jumps during the right moments and steps back and slows down to take in grandeur. The fight scenes are excitingly filmed, and the effects are no worse than any other film I've seen lately. Not the best, but everything moves quickly enough that you don't really notice. All in all, I got what I wanted; escapist, exciting, engaging fun that made me forget about the rest of the world for an hour and a half. And after all, isn't that what a movie is supposed to be? They can't all be caviar, sometimes I really just want popcorn.",
         "Before the movie was over (and before checking out the entry for the movie on this site), I had a strong suspicion that the Columbia/Tri-Star DVD of this movie I was watching was cut down from a longer print. After all, the same studio had butchered \"Who Am I\" a few years earlier. And a check of the \"Alternate versions\" link confirmed this for me. This cut played like a book missing its first few chapters, making it difficult for a long time to piece who was who and what the situation was. I also suspect some character development was cut out, since there is really nothing differentiating the four heroes from each other. Columbia/Tri-Star... STOP CUTTING HONG KONG FILMS! However, I must admit that even if the missing footage was put back in, the movie wouldn't be that much better. It's a pretty dull affair. The action scenes aren't very impressive in what they depict, and are sometimes edited in an incomprehensible way. The vampire villain looks unbelievably cheesy - in fact, despite the expensive use of CGI for a few effects, the movie looks like it was made on a tight budget. There's a sterility in the air, a stiffness that suggests the filmmakers weren't able to let loose and fill the movie with wonders and wackiness.",
         "Four students who have learnt the art of magic & martial arts seek vengeance on a resurrected & one time powerful general turned rotting vampire for abducting & possibly even killing their master, in 19th century China. However things won't be so easy as this vampire will prove to be the greatest challenge these students have ever faced & many will die as they attempt to send this thing back to the grave while uncovering some startling secrets along the way. THE ERA OF VAMPIRES is a film I have wanted to see when it first came out, however many times it just slipped out of my grasp, finally I was able to track down a copy & it was definitely worth the search! The film has many spectacular martial arts & sword fight action set pieces, grotesque zombie make-up & plenty of weird & interesting ideas plot points & twists. The villain here is a tough as nails & very hard villain to beat & is a nice change of pace from the usual vampire villains we've watched through the years. The acting, directing & art design is very well handled & the film has many moments of suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. What a shame this film isn't more widely known. A must see! **** stars",
         "When four hunters of the undead�Thunder, Wind, Rain and Lightning�are separated from their master during a battle with a King Vampire, they continue their hunt for the bloodsucker, using a magical Taoist compass to lead the way. Eventually they arrive at the home of Master Jiang, who is celebrating the marriage of his son to the beautiful Sasa. When the groom turns up dead the next day, having been bitten by a snake, the foursome are employed to find the reptile. Master Jiang informs Sasa that she need never be parted from her husband, because the family tradition is to preserve dead relatives with wax and store them in vaults below the house; she can visit him anytime she likes!! Meanwhile, it transpires that Sasa had been married off by her brother just so that she might be able to find the whereabouts of a hoard of gold hidden somewhere in the house and pass the information on to him. With that plan scuppered, Sasa's brother employs a 'zombie wrangler' to reanimate the waxy corpses under the house. With Master Jiang busy rounding up the zombies, he hopes to search the place for the hidden loot. Unfortunately, for everyone involved, the King Vampire shows up at the end to cause additional mayhem and chaos and it is up to the four heroes to save the day. Whilst this is no classic of the genre�the plot is far too messy�it does contain many elements which will prove to be of fun to fans of 80s Hong Kong vampire movies: the martial arts are of a reasonable standard, with some impressive swordplay and a bit of nifty wire-work, there is some fairly cheesy gore, and the reanimated bodies do the old hopping routine we all know and love. Best of all is the King Vampire, who has supernatural powers that enable him to suck blood at a distance and fire flames from his mouth. My main gripe with this film is that everything is just too dark. I found myself straining to see what was going on for most of the running time. I can ignore some dodgy CGI and iffy make-up effects, but I'd like to be able to see what the hell is going on. Despite the advances in film technology, Tsui Hark's Vampire Hunters remains an average production that does nothing to improve on the films that it emulates. Don't watch this with expectations too high, and you might find yourself enjoying it.",
         "It's obvious that the person with the negative view either expects a 'kung fu' film and didn't get it, or more likely never saw MR VAMPIRE... In order to enjoy this film I should think a little background on both Chinese mysticism and Hopping Zombie films are in order. I won't do either of the honors, but instead refer you to the Illuminated Lantern website where you can get at least a primer on both. AFA the film goes, I gave it a 7 out of 10 as it's a little disjointed, and lacks the flow of any really good Hopping Zombie film. But hey, at least someone whipped one of these out in the 00's, ten years after the genre died out. Kudos to Tsui Hark for that!",
         "The Era of Vampires is an interesting idea. Take the typical wuxia martial arts film and add a horror element in the form of vampires. On the surface this sounds great. Extraordinary fighting visuals with dark and supernatural tone. The inborn grace and elegance of vampires seems like an excellent fit for wuxia. Unfortunately we end up getting very little of that. Partly because the vampire they end up going with is radically different from a typical Western vampire. It's more of a force of nature, an unstoppable monster that rips into pieces everything standing in its way, visually more of a zombie lord than an aristocratic vampire. And it is utterly terrifying. I actually really like this take on one of the oldest monsters in our collective mythic lore. Fantastic horror villain, even if it means that the fights are not as grandeur as they would have otherwise been. What really fails this movie is the lackadaisical nature of the script. You don't really identify with any of the characters, the side plots are either clichéd or have nothing to do with the other plots, the backstory is convoluted and the world building doesn't really work. Plus the whole film is shot way too dark. Oftentimes you have problems making out what's happening, making the fight scenes even less stellar. That being said, there are some good fights and as stated, the vampire is very impressive. Making this a film that's fine to check out if you're really into wuxia or you want to see a radically different take on vampires. It's not really a good film, but it has its upsides."
