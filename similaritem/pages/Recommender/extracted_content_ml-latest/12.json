It's STILL at least 50,000 times funnier than Lena Dunham's 'Tiny Furniture' (or about 70% of the so-called contemporary American comedies made these days).",

      "synopsis": "Transylvania: 1893. A coach containing Thomas Renfield (Peter MacNicol), a solicitor from London, and two Transylvanian natives, rocks up a mountanous path. Renfield says he's feeling queasy and one of the helpful natives leans out the window to tell the driver to slow down. Just as he does so, he catches a glimpse of the setting sun and yells for the driver to go faster. The carriage rocks and jerks its way to the closest town. When they arrive, a townsperson opens the door of the carriage, and Renfield tumbles out headfirst. The driver throws his luggage down after him, saying he will go no further tonight. Renfield is forced to walk to his appointment at Dracula's castle, disregarding the townspeople's warnings about vampires as a silly superstition. By the time Renfield arrives, it is dark. He tries to knock at the door, but the knocker crumbles away in his hand. Just then, the doors swing open of their own accord. When Renfield steps in, the doors swing shut again and he turns around in surprise. Behind him, at the top of a long staircase, Count Dracula (Leslie Nielsen) makes his appearance. He stands still at the top of the stairs as shadow creeps forward across the wall in a predatory stance. Dracula scolds it in a foreign tongue and it retreats. Renfield, startled, turns around and is relieved to see the count. Dracula starts to introduce himself and trips on some bat guano, tumbling down the steps. He gets up at Renfield's feet, unharmed. He leads Renfield up the staircase, while his shadow limps across the wall behind him. As they walk up the stairs Dracula passes without incident through a giant spiderweb that is in the way. Renfield, confused, attempts to follow, only to become tangled in the web. He is still picking cobwebs off his clothes as he enters the room into which Dracula has led him. Dracula brings up his purchase of Carfax abbey. Renfield produces the documents. Just as Dracula is about to sign, Renfield gets a papercut. Blood spurts all over the documents as Renfield attempts to find his hankerchief. Dracula smacks his lips and looks on in interest. Later that night, Renfield is sleeping soundly in the guest room. The door creaks open and two vampire maidens float into the room. Renfield wakes up to see them molesting his furniture. He is indignant at their intrusion, but when they advance upon him he soon gives in to their mistrations with gusto. Dracula walks by to see them in a very comprimising position. He calls the vampires off and scolds them. They start to float out of the room, but he tells them to stop it, so they just stomp into the hall. Dracula finds Renfield cowering under the covers and tells him he was having a nightmare. He offers to show Renfield an old Transylvanian method of relaxation, where the other will stare deeply into his eyes. However, Renfield promptly falls asleep before Dracula can make him his slave. This happens once more before Dracula hoists Renfield up by his shoulders and goes through it all very fast. Renfields eyes get wider and more twitchy as he listens, and the scene ends with Renfield totally under Dracula's control. The next scene opens on a ship at sea. It is The Demeter, bound for England. Dracula's coffin is down below, being knocked about the cabin. Renfield enters and tries to tie down the coffin again, only to be crushed against the wall multiple times by the rocking ship. When Renfield finally manages to tie down the coffin, Dracula emerges with a groan. Renfield says he looks dried out, and offers him some whisky. Dracula refuses, and says he'll start with the first mate. A London Enterprise headline segways the next scene: Corpse of Captain Found on Empty Vessel-- Sole Survivor a Raving Maniac. At a showing of Faust, three theatre-goers look over the audience from their box seats. The fourth, Dr. Seward (Harvey Korman), who runs an insane asylum, enters late. His daughter, Mina (Amy Yasbeck), his ward, Lucy Westenra (Lysette Anthony), and Mina's fiancé, Jonathan Harker (Steven Weber) greet him. He apologizes for being late, citing the lunatic he brought in from the empty ship as an excuse. Meanwhile, Count Dracula approaches an usher (Leslie Sachs) in the hallway outside and requests to speak with Dr. Seward alone. He makes a gesture with his hand and she is instantly transformed into a mindless slave, repeating his request as she approaches the box. Just before she draws back the curtain, he adds \"and you will remember nothing of what I tell you.\" She draws the curtain to summon Dr. Seward and suddenly has no idea why she's there. Dracula, annoyed when she greets him for the second time, denys her a tip and says he'll do it himself. Dracula enters the box and introduces himself as the new owner of Carfax abbey, which ajoins Dr. Seward's sanitarium. He is just about to introduce himself fully when the usher returns, relaying the original message Dracula imparted upon her. Dr. Seward leaves at the summons and Jonathan Harker takes over, introducing the offended Dracula to the rest of the group. Dracula takes an interest in Lucy. At one point he stares, transfixed, at her neck. She seems flattered. Later that same night, Lucy looks out her window at Carfax abbey and undresses to just her nightclothes. As she gets into bed, Dracula turns into a bat and flies across to her window. Just as he reaches it, Lucy shivers and reaches out to push the window shut. It swings shut and Dracula flies into it head-on, sliding down the glass. Afterwards, in human form, he pushes in the window and hoists himself up onto the sill and into the room. Suddenly, a knock sounds at the door. Dr. Seward and Jonathan come in and turn on the light, saying they thought they heard a prowler. They search the room and find nothing, while Dracula clings desperately to the ceiling above their heads. They say goodnight and Dr. Seward slams the door on the way out. Dracula crashes to the floor. After the men have gone, Dracula creeps over to Lucy's bedside and begins to drink her blood with a loud, slurping noise. The next day opens on a cell in Seward's Sanitarium where Renfield fusses and frets on his cot. Martin, (Mark Blankfield) a caretaker at the sanitarium, enters and says Dr. Seward is ready to meet with Renfield. He leads him out to where Dr. Seward is sitting, eating lunch. Renfield takes the seat opposite him. Renfield acts normal until he catches sight of an insect and stuffs it into his mouth. This happens three more times and Renfield tries to play it off, but eventually Dr. Seward is forced to call Martin back to put Renfield in a straightjacket. That same morning, Mina comes into Lucy's room, where the other girl is still in bed. Mina remarks that Lucy looks pale, and Lucy says she doesn't think she can get out of bed. Mina calls her father and he examines the two little bruises on Lucy's neck with interest. Jonathan suggests an insect, and asks if Lucy recalls being bitten. Lucy alludes to a strange dream she had, but when they press her on the details she says she remembers nothing and drifts to sleep. Dr. Seward suggests contacting Dr. Abraham Van Helsing (Mel Brooks), who he thinks might be able to shed some light on the disease. At the London Hospital Dr. Abraham Van Helsing's autopsy lecture is being conducted. Van Helsing disects the body and passes various body parts around until every student has fainted. A nurse comes in and sees the bodies on the floor. She congratulates him on a \"ten out of ten.\" She then says she just got a message from Dr. Seward summoning VanHelsing to Whitby for an emergency. Van Helsing looks thoughtful. Dracula's coffin opens on a new morning. Dracula is at first startled that he can be up during the daytime, but then becomes joyful as he thinks that Lucy's blood had cured him. He goes out for a walk and samples a picnic. Suddenly, Renfield appears and warns him away. Dracula begins smoking in the sunlight. Startled he starts to run back to his coffin but can't seem to get anywhere. Cut to Dracula's coffin, which is rocking. Muffled screams are coming from within. It opens and Dracula looks around him, seeing that it is night. He was having a daymare. Van Helsing examines Lucy and can only suggest the interferance of a vampire. At first Jonathan and Dr. Seward don't believe him, but they come to as he explains his line of thinking. They ask what they can do, and Van Helsing consults a vampire book. He finds what he is looking for in the suggestion of hanging garlic around Lucy's room as she sleeps, to prevent Dracula from finishing the job. Dracula rises from his coffin that night and bumps his head on the chandalier directly above. He grumbles that he must move his coffin. Garlic drapes over every surface in Lucy's room that night. She complains about the smell, but Dr. Seward and Dr. Van Helsing insist. Dracula creeps up to the window once they have left and opens it, only to be warded away by the disgusting smell. The next time we see him he is at the window of Renfield's cell. He calls his slave to the window and bends open the bars, floating gracefully down to the ground. Dracula beacons to Renfield and he leaps from the window. Renfield gets up, groaning. Dracula reminds Renfield that he doesn't fly. Renfield limps after Dracula on the way to Lucy's room. Once there, Renfield opens the window and begins to gather wreaths of garlic in his arms. He is distracted, however, and peeks under Lucy's blankets. Lucy wakes up and screams. Renfield screams. Dr. Seward and Jonathan come in and restrain him. Martin appears at Dr. Seward's call and drags Renfield back to his cell. Jonathan closes the window. When Lucy is alone again Dracula uses his vampire powers to call her to him. She opens the window and steps out into the night. Mina steps out onto the terrace and sees a dark figure bending over Lucy's prostrate figure. She screams, which brings Dr. Seward and Jonathan stright to her side. They rush out into the night and find that they are too late. A funeral is held. Dr. Van Helsing warns that unless they stake her to her coffin she will rise from the grave. Seward expresses doubts about the whole vampire theory. Just then, Count Dracula is shown in. He is introduced to Van Helsing, who questions the relationship between Count Dracula and Vlad Dracula, who impaled his subjects on iron spikes. Dracula insists they had it coming. Van Helsing and Dracula engage in a childish game of trying to get the last word through insults in the language of Ancient Moldavian. The professor notices The Count never gives up, leading him to suspect Dracula might be the vampire. At the Westenra crypt voices are coming from within Lucy's coffin. A man drinking nearby hears and lets her out. She attacks him. Back at the house, Jonathan is going out to stand guard at Lucy's grave, just in case. We next see him walking in the graveyard with a lantern. Suddenly, he hears his name called out long and soft. Lucy, now transformed into a vuluptuous vampire, steps out of the shadows. She begs Jonathan to come away with her, and tries to seduce him. However, he is too British to succumb to her wiles. She tries to bite him, but Van Helsing steps out of the darkness with a cross to drive her back. She retreats to her crypt, with Van Helsing at her heels. When Van Helsing and Jonathan enter the crypt they find Lucy lying prostrate in her coffin. Jonathan thinks she's dead, but Van Helsing says that unless she is staked through the heart by one who loved her in life she will rise again. Jonathan insists that he only liked her, but Van Helsing will hear none of it. He retreats behind a pillar and Jonathan hits the stake as hard as he can with a mallot Van Helsing produced. A deluge of blood pours out from where the stake drove in and Jonathan is soaked. He hits it one more time, with the same effect. Van Helsing hands him a hankerchief. Back at the house, Mina's nurse, Essie (Megan Cavanaugh) is sitting watch over her while she sleeps. Dracula is out in the garden and hypnotizes Essie to fall asleep and makes Mina awake. Dracula orders Mina to the door and there is some confusion in which he accidentally carries Essie away. When he realizes his mistake he drops her and goes back for Mina, spiriting her away into the night. Jonathan and Van Helsing return. Seward is shocked at Jonathan's appearance and makes him use the servant's entrance. At Carfax Abbey Dracula carries Mina into a candlelit room. They begin to dance, as a dusty old organ accompanies their movements. Their shadows dance and Dracula's shadow gets a little carried away, if you know what i mean. Dracula yells at it to stop, and they continue dancing. Dracula bites her. The next morning Mina is up early while Essie sleeps. Jonathan comes in and they wake her. Jonathan comments that Mina looks different, and she agrees, saying she's changed. She comes on to him, which makes Jonathan uncomfortable. Her father comes in and catches them in a very compromising position. Jonathan blames Mina, but she rescinds all blame. Seward is furious and orders Jonathan out. Van Helsing comes in and is suspicoius of Mina right away. He rips off her scarf to reveal two tiny puncture marks on her throat. She claims she did it pinning a shawl, but when Van Helsing presents her with a cross she faints. The group decides they need to find out the identity of the vampire, and Van Helsing suggests a way. The next scene opens with a ball. They invite Dracula and Renfield. Dracula comes up behind them while they are talking and startles them. He spots Mina and asks to dance. Jonathan is about to refuse, when Van Helsing stomps on his foot. Renfield calls Dracula's attention on his way to Mina. Renfield is suspicious of the circumstances under which he was invited. Dracula agrees that it is suspicious and says that if he is discovered he has movied his coffin to an abandoned Chapel, and that Renfield must meet him there, making sure not to be followed. Dracula begins to dance with Mina. Martin is given the signal to drop the curtain from a giant mirror. Everyone starts staring at Dracula and Mina, because he does not reflect in the mirror. He thinks they're staring because he's a good dancer. When he finally figures it out, he snarles and throws a table through the window. With Mina in his arms he leaps into the night. Renfield yells out after him, but quickly covers it. Van Helsing is suspicious of Renfield, and suggests they let him go to see if he'll lead them to Dracula. Renfield starts off in the direction Dracula indicated, only to remember his advice. To make sure he isn't followed he zig-zags in a circle and then advances, sure that he lost them. Renfield arrives at the castle, proud of his achievement. It is just then that Dracula hears the sound of his pursuers at the gate. Renfield is crushed that he couldn't fulful his duty, and begs Dracula to punish him. Dracula obliges and throws Renfield down the stairs. The group tramples over him on the way up the stairs. The door is locked when they get up, however. Dracula leans down to bite Mina as they beat on the door, and just as his fangs are about to sink in they break in. There is a struggle, at the end of which Dracula turns into a bat and flies into the rafters to escape. While he is up there, they are unable to burn him with the light of the sun. Just as Dracula thinks he's safe, however, Renfield opens a pannel in the ceiling for escape, accidentally letting in the sun. Bat-Dracula goes down in a ball of flames and Mina awakens as herself again. Jonathan carries Mina out the door. Just after them, Renfield comes in the room, sobbing. He scoops up his master's ashes, places them in his coffin and draws a smiley-face in them, trying to fix it. Seward tells him that he doesn't need to serve anyone anymore. Renfield follows him out the door, saying, \"Yessss masssster.\" As Van Helsing puts on his hat, he opens Dracula's coffin and shouts one last insult in Ancient Moldavian, getting the last word. He slams the coffin shut as the film ends.",

         "\"Dracula: Dead and Loving It\" is a movie that seems to define what someone either really likes or dislikes about a comedy, and more specifically a parody: gags. For me, the gags herein worked, there were reasons for their having been used and therefore makes it funny to me. The storyline didn't stall, the gags weren't desperate for laughs, and the acting was exactly what was needed: the comedic touch. The casting choice to have Steven Weber and Amy Yasbeck, both veterans of the TV series \"Wings\", was brilliant because the chemistry between their personalities was proven and honed before the movie. The choice of Leslie Nielsen for the titular role was dead-on. Someone that has the wisdom of centuries (decades, whatever), is cunning (a la the Naked Gun series), and above all, never gives up (until turned to dust). Mel Brooks, having proved his comedic prowess with films like \"Young Frankenstein\", comes through in the role of Van Helsing. Even the incidental characters seem to have a reason to belong and flow in the movie, like Essie, the guardian of Mina, or Martin, Dr. Seward's right-hand man of the sanitarium... Martin: \"...the patient in the west wing? He's havin' a conniption fit.\" Dr. Seward: \"Oh. Give him an enima.\" As stated, the movie will most likely be quite funny or very dull, depending on what the viewer expects from it beforehand. Being that I like a good slapstick comedy (and I do), the performances above all are what were able to pull me in. FOOSH-TAA! \"Dracula: Dead and Loving It\" gets 9 of 10 stars",
         "Mel Brooks, one of my favorite directors of all time, he's delivered some of the most memorable comedies: Young Frankenstein, Spaceballs, The Producers, High Anxiety, Blazing Saddles, Robin Hood: Men in Tights. He now brings us Dracula: Dead and Loving it, one of my favorite guilty pleasures. I know there is a bit of hate for this movie because a lot of people say that Mel lost his touch and this isn't as funny as his older films. Let's face it, Mel peeked pretty early in his career with Young Frankenstein, which is one of my favorite films of all time, but everyone is naturally going to compare every film that he made at that point with his greatest movies. But if you seriously are telling me that there was not one scene that you didn't laugh at then you need your funny bone checked. The year is 1893, solicitor Thomas Renfield travels all the way from London to Transylvania to meet an important client. As he nears the end of his journey, the sun sets, and the stagecoach driver refuses to take him any further. Kindly villagers plead with him to turn back, but Renfield explains that he is expected. Renfield arrives safely and meets Count Dracula, a charming but rather strange man who is, of course, a vampire. Dracula signs the papers finalizing the purchase of Carfax Abbey in England, and Renfield retires for the night. He wakes up when two Brides of Dracula come gliding seductively in. Dracula then casts a hypnotic spell on the suggestible Renfield, making him his slave. Dracula and Renfield soon embark for England. He goes ashore, leaving Renfield behind. When Renfield is discovered alone on the ship, he is confined to a lunatic asylum. Dracula introduces himself to his new neighbors: Doctor Seward, owner of the asylum where Renfield is being held, and a believer in enemas as a sovereign remedy for mental illness; Seward's assistant, Jonathan Harker; Seward's beautiful daughter Mina; and Seward's ward, the equally pretty Lucy. Dracula flirts with Lucy and, later that night, he feeds on her blood. The next day, Mina discovers Lucy still in bed late in the morning, looking strangely pale. Seward, puzzled by the odd puncture marks on her throat, calls in an expert on obscure diseases, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. Van Helsing is convinced that Dracula is a vampire and that they must destroy him before he gets to Mina next. Dracula: Dead and Loving It may be a bit silly at times, but seriously, you can't help but laugh. It's certainly a lot better then most spoof movies today. How could you not love Leslie Nielson as Dracula? He was so hilarious, but who truly stole the show? Peter MacNicol as Reinfield, I can't tell you how hard he made me laugh, if one laugh supposedly makes you loose 3 calories, I think I lost 15,000 calories with just his scenes. Reinfield being seduced by Dracula's brides, him trying to save Dracula's coffin on the ship from hitting the walls back and forth, him sneaking under Lucy's bed sheets to peak at her, to the ending, actually every scene with him is non stop laughs. I don't care what people think, I'm not comparing, I think this is a very funny movie and is just a blast to watch, if you don't laugh while watching this movie, you're not invited to my parties, you party pooper! 8/10",
         "\"Dracula: Dead and loving it\" (1995) has to be one of the most if not the most underrated Mel Brooks comedy. As inspired by Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, this movie is part of the absolute highlights in the career of Brooks. I didn't like \"Robin Hood: Men in tights\" (1993) half as much. It had some good moments here and there and couple decent laughs but overall it left me pretty disappointed. \"Dracula: Dead and loving it\" was phenomenal, script was so hilarious almost every joke hit the bullseye. I didn't expect much when I started to watch it for the first time couple of years ago. Critics made this one look like a waste of time and that's what I afraid it would eventually be. Surprisingly I found myself rolling on the floor laughing like a maniac. I watched it again almost immediately and I was laughing to its ingenious and outstanding humor days and days afterwards. I mean how can they possibly make this classic story look so damn amusing and ridiculous? I love the terrific cast. Lelsie Nielsen makes one of the wittiest performances of his life as Count Dracula. Next year he played the leading role of almost unbearable \"Spy hard\". I guess he already gave everything he got in this film and had nothing left to make the audience laugh anymore. Peter MacNicol is wonderful as Renfield and Mel Brooks steals the show in the scenes where he plays Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. \"Dracula: Dead and loving it\" is absolutely sensational parody masterpiece and I simply can't understand people who seem to find it bad. Definitely one of the funniest films of the 90's. If I have to list the most funniest movies I've ever seen in my whole life, this one will most certainly be mentioned too. 10/10.",
         "The one key element to UNDERSTAND and to enjoy a send-up like this is having the knowledge of its background. If you are not familiar with the original story of Dracula, as well as seeing both the Bela Lugosi and Gary Oldman movies, with others in between, then the gags will be lost on you. People have rated that Brooks is losing his touch. Not so. His audience is losing touch with his level of intellect. A send-up's gags are only funny to those who recognize the source, and realize the play of the situation taking place. In Spaceballs, for instance, the final conflict between Helmet and Lonestarr, Helmet makes a play on the \"Luke I am your Father\" scene from Empire Strikes Back. But if you have never seen that film, you won't know that, and so the line \"I am your father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate\" would be lost on you totally. The acting is great in the movie. Those attacking the \"bad\" British accents should refer to other Dracula films to understand the joke. In oother Dracula films, accents come off as so fake, it's painful to watch, and that's the joke. The style of the film itself takes heavily from the Bela Lugosi version, in its design and arrangement of characters, though references to the Oldman film are used as well. Leslie Neilson did a great job in the role of Dracula, and his Renfield, Peter MacNichol, was a superb performance. This movie deserves full credit for its level of parodistic comedy, even if it is lost on viewers. If you can't stand this movie, or find it unentertaining, then maybe you don't understand its roots well enough to appreciate it.",
         "This was another entertaining Mel Brooks farce, a la Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles. If you liked those, you'd like this. Peter MacNichol almost steals the show in this film as \"Renfield.\" He just drives me buggy. Leslie Nielsen, who revived his career later in life playing goofy roles, also is very good, this time as 'Dracula.\" Actually, I thought he was far better in here than in those other spoofs, such as the \"Naked Gun\" series. It may be his best comedic role. The two women in here, Amy Yasback and Lysette Anthony, are beautiful, and well-endowed as Brooks - and a lot of us guys - likes 'em. They are in the film for their looks while the other two provide the laughs. Story-wise, it's just a light-hearted look at the story of Dracula, told many times in the films, mostly in the serious vein (pun intended) except for \"Love At First Bite\" which was similar in laughs to this. After watching this film, I could never look at garlic or blood the same way! When you need some good laughs and nothing else, this will fill the need for an hour-and-a-half.",
         "Renfield set out to find Count Dracula in Transylvania, and it was immediately clear from people's reactions that this would be a funny movie. Eventually, Renfield and Dracula ended up on a ship, and in England, Dracula began causing problems for Dr. Seward, the man running an asylum, and his daughters. Renfield was apparently Dracula's servant by this time. Dr. Van Helsing was called in to find out what was going on. I like this kind of comedy. It wasn't 'Naked Gun' or 'Airplane!' but Leslie Nielsen, Harvey Korman and Mel Brooks were very good given the material. I didn't care for the blood and gore, but sometimes the gore was not violent, just silly. Some highlights: When one hypnotizes someone, that person must be sure that when he says to forget everything you've been told by the hypnotist, that this applies only after you have done what the hypnotist said to do. Dracula did not. Dracula hypnotized Mina and Essie at the same time. One person who turned into a vampire had to be killed for good with a stake. I'm not saying whether this was accomplished, only that the attempt was hilarious. 'Oh, yes, we have Nosferatu.' Dracula danced in front of a mirror. Great special effects, good choreography since the partner had to know what to do alone.",
         "This was the second Mel Brooks film I ever watched, and I positively reeled in laughter watching it. I do not understand how this movie only achieves a 4.5 rating. Among the many memorable moments there are several downright hysterical gags: when Dracula slips in the bat poop trying to walk down the stairs, when Harker drives the stake and is drenched in blood, when Dracula rises from his coffin and bashes his head on the chandelier...the list goes on and on. Also, Harvey Korman was extremely funny as the bumbling, blubbering Dr Seward; as was Mel Brooks as Dr Van Helsing, and Leslie Nielson as Dracula. I give it 9/10.",
         "\"Dracula: Dead and Loving It\" is a masterful spoof, though the intricacies would never be recognized by someone unfamiliar with Bram Stoker's novel. The attention to detail, and Brooksian destruction of it is superb.",
         "Mel Brooks's scattergun approach to comedy has a number of misses. Spaceballs was OK at parodying its genre. This film is far more sophisticated and well played. The successful jokes are on the culture of Victorain times with references to an engaged couple who after 10 years have suddenly held hands being condemned as immoral, prostitutes, lechers and the like. Into these cultural and successful observations Brook's introduces Leslie Nielson doing a great impression of Bela Lugosi's Dracula with the difference that his powers are incompetent. Seeing the Lugosi movie will give you the basis to appreciate the sophistication of this film.",
         "The film is not vintage Mel Brooks and it has some obvious flaws, but it is nonetheless a true joy to watch and is sure to make you smile. My main problem was that it did not meet my initial expectations. Young Frankenstein is CLASSIC Mel Brooks. It is a flawless film parody of the Frankenstein myth. I went into seeing Dracula: Dead and Loving It with extremely high expectations and was a bit disappointed. The film, however, is a good film and a good parody of the Bram Stoker classic It is not as good as Love at First Bite, but has many excellent moments. Some of the highlights are Leslie Nielson, with whom the torch of modern comedy rests safely for being absurd yet sublime in his characterization, his superb imitation of Bela Lugosi's mannerisms and speech enhance his comedy. The film also is surprisingly faithful; to the novel and has many inside jokes. Harvey Korman, Peter MacNicol, and Mel Brooks all lend a hand in the lunacy. The setting is surreal and gives the picture a Hammeresgue quality. A must see for horror fans who like a good belly laugh!"

Basically, he took \"Bram Stoker's Dracula,\" gave it a new cast and a new script and made a big joke out of it. The usual, rich English are attacked by Dracula and Dr. Van Helsing is brought in to save the day.",
