         "One of the best Turkish movies done in the recent years... Very real dialogs, very sincere characters and most of all good performances of all actors. It can easily create a very intimate relationship with the audience and can catch you from the first moment. The characters and casting is very successful and the love story throughout the movie does not pile on the agony but will affect you truly and deeply. Especially the performances of supporting actress Serra Yılmaz(Mete's mother)and supporting actor Rıza Kocaoglu (Murat)are worth watching. The soundtrack of the movie is also very successful containing a large variety of different styles and reflecting a pleasant taste. In summary,it deserves its place as a cult movie in modern Turkish cinematography.",
         "This is the best Turkish movie I've ever seen.. It's extraordinary and marginal. Namely, full of art.. If I had one word to explain this movie , it would be \"perfect\".. I was impressed deeply. Whole characters in the movie are so real.. It describes loneliness in an ingenious way.. Moreover ,this movie's humorous is really high.. I enjoyed so much..I was touched, laughed, self-questioned while watching this movie.. Additionaly,soundtracks had been chosen compatible. I would like to thank Tolga Ornek for presenting us such a special movie..I think everyone can find a lot of things closer to oneself in this film.. I recommend \"Kaybedenler Kulübü\" to all movie-lovers.",
         "As a youngster who grew up in Kadıköy, I heard many familiar words, I saw many familiar places while watching this awesome masterpiece. The thing, that distinguished this movie from the trivial ones, was the way it connected all these familiar places and words to construct an overwhelming composition of thought and emotion rewriting the philosophy of love according to the contemporary male manifest. I doubted that this movie would be that good before seeing it as I saw many negative comments about it as well as a few positive ones. After seeing it though I have no doubt that this was the best Turkish movie ever made, even better than \"Issız Adam\". It kept me thinking for hours and it brought me to tears sometimes. If you think that you are lonely; this movie will show you another way of being lonely which is no better than being the usual loner anyhow. It will cause you to go swinging in opposite directions like a pendulum until you are completely lost and decide that there are many lessons to be taken but no absolute truth at all. And finally you will find yourself wandering in the streets of Kadıköy, where the movie is shot, after so many years contemplating about your past while trying to create a better future and being in between, losing both. Welcome to the losers' club..",
         "Based on the true story of the two Turkish radio jockeys (RJs) from the 90s, who are the talk of the late night. It was more like a Turkish version of 'The Boat that Rocked' but the thing was the radio station and programme were legal. I found the movie was a little slow in pace but deals with an interesting thematic plot. The movie tells the story of Kaan and Mete, the radio show hosts. The two ordinary guys with a boring daily livelihood suddenly become colourful once theirs late night radio programme called 'Loser's Club' instantly becomes a hit. They become the celebrities as well as threats from the religious people. One of them finds his dream girl. Whatsoever they are not ready to change themselves to the current situation. They want left alone like everybody else, so what happens to their fame is the ending part of the movie. Both the lead actors were executed simple performances but looked so powerful. The lead lady, called Zeynep, was also a good and looking cute. Most of the movie shot at the night time, I mean almost, so the light was used very wisely. The movie was simple as its look and complicated to get at first glance. One of a fine Turkish drama I have seen, quite resembles the quality and style of the German movie 'The Lives of Others'. 7.5/10",
         "Tolga Ornek is a very successful documentary producer. \"Kaybedenler Kulubu\" could be a better documentary than a movie. The pace of the movie is sometimes so slow that you lose your concentration. The dialog is sometimes hard to follow and not very interesting at some other times. In the end, I do not find the characters sincere and the radio program they are serving worthwhile to listen. The love in the movie does not get enough electricity but more than enough sex scenes which obviously aim to attract audience to the movie. At the end, I give an OK grade to the movie but easily understand if others love it. (it all depends if you like the characters and the radio show)",
         "nice film.the theme of this film comedy but this film is make thinking... In film,there i 2 radio programmer,the difference of this programmers is they use a lot of rude words,and talking about sex.but also they talk about the life,the problems and the philosophy. In they life he make all the time sex with the girls he don't know. But one day they are meet the girls who changed they life.. after he the film finished.but this the film every one must watch..if you are not live in turkey,you should get this film... Nejat ısler et other person play so good.ı can't tell th end but end was so special.",
         "I liked this movie. I think thats one of the best Turkish movies that I have ever met. Outstanding and outrageous movie... It has very calm and sincere characters and most of all good performances of all cast. Yigit Ozsener has the great performance of his career. The movie can also catch you from the first moment. Love story actually affects you very deeply. The supporting actor whom we know him from the series Ezel, Rıza Kocaoglu (Murat) is worth watching. The soundtrack of the movie is also great especially the last of scenes. As an abstract,it should have the first place in Turkish cinema history. Finally, please do not miss to watch because it is pure heroically marvelous movie.."
