         "So Evil So Young has a great title and an early appearance by Jill Ireland, but at heart it remains what it is: a Danziger Brothers production. That means a poor script, a largely unknown cast, and a minimum of thrills. The film hearkens back to similar American films like Caged (1950) but is, of course, a much more genteel affair. Nonetheless, this film is relatively interesting, being one of the few Technicolor films the Brothers produced. Perhaps the Eadie money arrived early that month. It's always fun to see these glimpses of pre-Beatles coffee bar culture in England, especially when you can see how bright red the glace cherries are on the buns, and there are a couple of brief snippets of early '60s rock and roll, performed by John Charlesworth as Tom, Jill's love interest whilst she's behind bars in a girls' borstal serving time for a crime she did not commit. Not to worry--justice is ultimately served.",
         "An innocent girl, Ann (Jill Ireland) is framed by an evil girl, Lucy (Jocelyn Britton) and sent to a borstal (British girls prison). There we have an evil prison guard, suicides, cat fights, riots and a strong suggestion of lesbianism. For what it is, it's not bad. It's made in bright, strong colors and has a fairly decent script. Jill Ireland is actually pretty good as Ann, Sheila Whittingham is equally fine as a fellow inmate and Ellen Pollock amusingly chews the scenery as the evil Miss Smith. Also the lesbian suggestions were pretty strong for its time. But I can only give this a 5. For some reason, they play sleazy music almost constantly in the background. It never matches whats playing on the screen and totally destroys any dramatic impact. Also, you can tell the actors are doing a good job, but the music is really distracting. At some points the music almost drowns out the dialogue! What's the point of all that? So, without the music I would probably give it a higher rating but, as it stands, I can only give this a 5.",
         "\"Girls Caged Without Their Guys!\" That's what the poster for this movie promises, with some kind of leering suggestion of depravity. The film is about a young girl--Ann, played by a young Jill Ireland--who is falsely accused of a crime. She is sent to a reformatory where there is another girl who is out to get her. But the real villain of the film is Miss Smith, a vindictive martinet who seems to enjoy punishing the girls in her care. A regular Captain Bligh, she runs her tight ship solely for the pleasure of exerting power over the young women. She uses a cane and exudes a flawed psyche like Nurse Ratched or the commandant of a Nazi POW camp. The story is simplistic--suitable for a cheap drive-in double header. The acting is satisfactory, but uneven. What most annoys is the cheery jazz score that accompanies every scene, regardless of the dramatic content. It proves very distracting and laughable at times. It's not that the music is bad; it's just inappropriate, undermining the emotional impact of scenes.",
         "One of a couple of colour co-features the Danziger Brothers made around the turn of the 1960s, this was written by an American and follows the American \"women in prison\" stereotype except that of course it has no teeth. The reform school inmates are all well turned-out young ladies and it's absurd that one of them is described as having \"a distinct Cockney accent\" because everybody uses RP. There's a brief riot; but the main appeal for lads at the time would have been the girls in bed scenes. There's also a hint of lesbianism. The coffee bar looks nothing like one and the pop star who's performing (John Charlesworth) doesn't open his mouth while the track is playing! (Charlesworth finished his role then killed himself). Watch out, during the penultimate scene, for the actress who flinches before she's slapped. The film probably inspired \"House of Whipcord\". Some of the lines are identical and the parts of the lesbian wardress played here by Ellen Pollock and in \"Whipcord\" by Sheila Keith are basically the same. The film's currently on You Tube.",
         "***SPOILERS*** Framed for a crime, Jewel robbery & assault, sweet and innocent Anne is given six months hard time at the notorious,without bars and gates, Wilsham juvenile womens prison where the person who framed her Lucy in incarcerated in. It was Lucy who got hot in the collar as well as in her panties when she saw Anne making out with her boyfriend handsome guitarist Tom. Planting the stolen jewelry in Anne's jacket had her arrested and sentenced which didn't, in her being innocent, make Anne very happy. Besides Lucy Anne is now accosted by the prison Sergeant of the Guards Mrs. Smith who seems to have it in for her in her being the prison warden or matron Joan Haythorne's favorite pet. Mrs. Smith also has it in for Joan in feeling that she not her deserves, in working in that hell hole for some 20 years, that prestigious position. Things really heat up at Wilshem when the girls throw a going away party for the just to be released, after serving four years for armed robbery, Mary who was found by Mrs. Smith out of her bed dancing after lights out and sent to the hole, solitary confinement, as punishment. With Mary not knowing that Warden Haythorne will not extend her sentence she ends up hanging herself in the prison playroom. This sparks a major riot with the girls lead by Lucy beating the living hell out of Mrs. Smith whom they held responsible for Mary's suicide. ***SPOILERS*** It's finally discovered that Lucy's partner in crime Claire, whom Anne took the rap for, pawned off the stolen jewelry at Honest Moran's pawn shop. It's Honest Morgan who then called the police, in being the honest person that he is, to report the heist and thus, proving that she didn't do it, throwing a life line to Anne. With a now outraged Lucy seeing that she's been double-crossed by her friend Claire in trying to pawn off the jewelry and keep the cash, while Lucy's in jail, all for herself. This soon lead to a vicious cat fight between the two girls that had Lucy,while getting her face & eyes clawed, to implicate Chaire and having Anne found innocent.",
         "This film begins with two young ladies, \"Lucy\" (Jocelyn Britton) and \"Claire\" (Bernice Swanson) sneaking into a house and stealing some jewelry from the safe. Unfortunately for them, the butler comes in and recognizes Lucy before being knocked unconscious from behind by Claire. When he comes back to his senses he calls the police and gives Lucy's description to them. Knowing that she will soon be arrested Lucy gives all of the jewelry to Claire to hold onto until she eventually gets releasedï¿½except for a diamond bracelet which she keeps for herself. However, when she walks into a local hangout she notices her former boyfriend \"Tom\" (John Charlesworth) talking to another young lady named \"Ann\" (Jill Ireland) and she becomes extremely jealous. So she slips the diamond bracelet into Ann's coat pocket and upon being arrested tells the police that Ann was her accomplice. Even though Ann denies the charges she is found guilty and sent to a reform school along with Lucy. Things get dicey after that. Anyway, rather than detail what follows I will just say that this film was relatively tame for the genre. There is no sex or profanity and the couple of episodes of violence were rather tame as well. In short, this is a movie that is watchable but isn't quite as good as several other movies of this type."
