Slapstick B-Movie science fiction on a low budget.",

         "I was fortunate enough to catch a midnight screening of this movie tonight. I must say, I was expecting a horribly cheap movie with bad acting and a mediocre plot. I was completely mistaken. This movie was not only incredibly entertaining, but everything about it I simply loved. Bruce Campbell was as amazing as ever. The biggest surprise was none other than Ted Raimi, you know, Sam's little brother. He played the mad doctor's henchman to the greatest extent. Somewhere between physical comedy and clever dialogue, he did nothing but shine. But i really cannot ignore the magic that is Bruce Campbell. Though I did think that Ted Raimi stole the show, Bruce did what he does best on the big screen. Somewhere between the sketchy nasty American business man and the tragic victim, he displayed the same energy that he has always shown to be incredibly attractive to audiences. The movie itself was often interrupted by applause from the viewers. The crowd was definitely excited with each little turn that the movie took. This movie may not be Oscar material, but my goodness, it was amazing. I would highly recommend this to any Bruce Campbell fan. Also, anybody that likes campy sci-fi movies, do yourself a favor and watch this. Can't wait till this makes it out to DVD. Take it as you want to.... - the fed",
         "I don't know what some people were thinking when they said this movie was bad. It Was Great. Classic Bruce Campbell, yes it was low budget and the special effect showed this but that is not what you see a Bruce movie for you watch it for Bruce. Also Ted Rami was excellent. I found this movie hilarious and entertaining I still crack up when I recall Bruce on that pink moped. Now I will admit this movie is not for everyone if you don't like B movies you probably won't like this one if you crave big budget effects and actors steer clear. But if you like slap stick and off the wall sci-fi plots this movie is for you. Hail The King Baby!",
         "I went to see this movie at a book signing in Lexington, Ky last night. After a wonderful night that consisted of a few brief words with Mr. Bruce Campbell (you have to say it all, not just Bruce or Mr. Campbell ;D), friends while the books were being signed, and a QnA session with our favorite deadite killer the lights dimmed. So as not to spoil anything, I wont go into detail...but I loved the movie! Mr. Bruce Campbell did a wonderful job keeping the classic b-movie feel. The characters were classic 'b' characters, the place was refreshing (what movies do *you* know of that are based in Bulgaria?) and the setting was both near-original and fun! On top of that the humor that is portioned throughout the movie that kept the audience laughing through much of the movie. While this movie dosen't have as great of a general appeal to people as some, it is a beacon of fun and laughter in a season of (as Mr. Bruce Campbell put it) 'b-movies' that are listed as 'a-movies' (Bewitched, Dukes of Hazard, Charlie and the Chocolate factory? Come on guys!).",
         "These are the kinds of movies I loved, and still love growing up. Unlike big budget movies that crate huge plot holes and never acknowledge them. This movie takes in all in stride and just makes something you can sit back and enjoy. There was some film student earlier that complained it wasn't A list material. But that is not the point. The point of this movie is that no everyone likes huge CGI Cliché' filled movies. There are a lot of people who like movies that are meant to just entertain you, and not get as much money as they can. Besides, its also nice to know that good ol' Bruce isn't dead yet.",
         "Shot entirely on location in Bulgaria, The Man With The Screaming Brain is a hilarious love story between two rich ugly-American types and a murderous hotel maid gypsy. William Cole and his wife Jackie arrive in Bulgaria on a business trip and catch a cab driven by hustler Yegor. Things start to go awry when Tatoya, the maid, murders Yegor and William and a mad scientist implants a piece of Yegor's brain in William's head. Robots eventually become involved, as do gypsies with broken fingers, head injuries, Bruce Campbell riding a pink Vespa with prissy little streamers, and All-Of-Me-style physical comedy by a character at war with a voice in his brain who controls half of his body. The Man With The Screaming Brain is an incredibly funny film. It has the most hilarious tracking shot I have ever seen (when Bruce Campbell's character, fresh from the lab and complete with giant forehead scar and blue hospital pajamas, runs into a square and scares a crowd of people) and a falling-down-the-steps murder scene that had the entire test screening audience screaming laughing. The whole thing is a damn riot from beginning to end and I would recommend it to any fan of physical comedy, Bruce Campbell, or B-movies in general.",
         "Okay, so I love silly movies. If you enjoy silly sci-fi movies, over the top movies, or if you are a fan of Mr. Bruce Campbell, i would go see this movie. This movie is all that i wanted it to be. Being a fan of over the top movies, this fit the bill. Every time i thought to myself \"this movie would be the sillest, best movie ever if *blank* would happen....\" then just as i thought it, *blank* would happen. It's a wonderful silly 'b'-movie. If you are a fan of Campbell i'd say 'see it', bring your friends, laugh at it. It's fun. It's not classic, or anything, but if it's on TV some night, watch it. It has become, for me, a movie i would file under \"indulgent movies\". Movies that may not be good, but after a hard day of work, i could come home and watch, (this list also includes 'harold and kumar go to white castle', 'army of darkness', and ' Intolerable Cruelty' ) If you feel like a over the top, wonderfully slightly bad movie, watch this. if not, go rent \"Bubba Ho-tep\"",
         "Granted, there wasn't actually a screaming brain. We (myself, the wife, a good friend, and my sister in law) just saw this in a local showing in conjunction with a book signing of his new book, \"Make Love The Bruce Campbell Way.\" And, keeping in mind I'm rather a big fan of the esteemed Mr. Campbell, and have been for years, I must, unfortunately, only give it a 6 of 10 score. And that partially due to Mr. Campbell's apologies in advance. The movie was a happy melange of slapstick and ideas happily lifted from a variety of other old horror films. Given that I was tipped by the title that this wouldn't probably be on this year's Oscar list, I didn't go in expecting too much. I was right. What I saw was an amusing little film (and I did find many of the jokes funny, by the way) which was a pleasant way to waste a couple of hours, along with a confirmation of long held ideas about Bulgarian motor sports which have plagued me for years. In addition, it does give an interesting view of Mr. Campbell's own world view. Don't walk into the movie expecting much and you won't be disappointed. Expect a masterpiece and you will be. (Now to avenge myself on Mr. Campbell for introducing my wife to an excitingly ethnic and film geek approved way to criticize my driving.)",
         "This is screamingly funny (well, except when Bruce is in the hospital scene, which is a little sad). Ted Raimi and Stacy Keach are both excellent and worth watching. Sure, it's not a big budget-suit controlled blockbuster, but it's everything it promises to be and more- and BTW- the women are wonderful in their parts, though I don't know them from other movies, I'd welcome seeing them again. The two-brain walking scene is inspired and certainly a showcase for Bruce's outstanding physical comedy- he is one yummy guy! Thanks Bruce, for your brain, this is your baby!",
         "I saw it last night and I was laughing out loud for the whole second half of the movie. The whole audience was. Bruce Campbell has made a damn funny movie! I don't want to give anything away, but when the film turns and gets wacky, it gets really wacky. Just one funny scene after another. My hats of to Mr. Campbell and crew for pulling this off on such a tiny budget. Bruce was there to introduce the film and do a Q and A, which was a treat. A lot of the questions people were asking were pretty lame, but Bruce would turn it around on them and be all sarcastic. He was great! Anyway, loved the film. I'll be looking forward to seeing this on DVD later this year. B sure to check it out on the Sci-Fi channel this fall. I highly recommend this one.",
         "Disappointing. That would be one way to put this film. Not that it's terrible or anything, but� well, ahhh hell. Just read on� This film stars the legendary Bruce Campbell�legendary for his classic underground, cult, and, *ahem* \"B-movies.\" Well, hell, I love the guy. A lot of people do. His films are entertaining, he's entertaining. So why wouldn't a film starring the guy, written by him, and directed by him be good? It turns out there's a lot of reasons, but here's the quickie story: Capitalist American businessman (Bruce Campbell, of course) travels to former \"Red\" Socialist Bulgaria on business. Well, crap happens and suddenly he's dead. When next he's alive, well holy hell, he has half another man's brain in his cranium. A communist man's brain! Well, following this, some craziness ensues and Bruce and his \"dead\" wife, and his half-Commie brain hunt for the gypsy woman that done killed 'em all. Sounds pretty good so far� Here's the breakdown: The Good: --The acting, for the most part, is much better than I would have expected�especially from Stacy Keach and Ted Raimi. --Bruce Campbell beating himself up�always entertaining. --Bizarre story�always good. --Some really good humor. --Wacky throw-back to bad 50's Science Fiction films with adequate cheesiness. Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help: --The special effects are kind of poor, but entertaining nonetheless. --Over-all somewhat lackluster writing. --Decent action. The Bad: --Some pretty tedious parts, unfortunately. --Poor atmosphere. I personally wish Bruce had enlisted Don Coscarelli to Direct. --Capitalist brain melded with a Socialist brain? Seems like there should've been some more depth in those two extremes fighting each other. Pity. The Ugly: --Bruce is a great actor, and a funny and entertaining guy�and really cool. Know what he really isn't? A director. --Again, for those like me�Bruce Campbell fans�this film is kind of a disappointment. Here's why: It was a long time coming, it was written, directed, and starring Bruce Campbell. And after the brilliant Bubba Ho-Tep (helmed by Phantasm's Don Coscarelli), the Evil Dead Trilogy, and many of Bruce's other successes�well, for fans, there's a lot of hype in preparing for this one. Also, the idea that it was kind of Bruce's \"pet-project\" and one he'd been planning and working on for years gave this film some added heft when it comes to \"getting one's hopes up.\" Memorable Scene: --When Bruce is first running around and battling the idea of having two brains. This is not a bad film, but it's not exactly great. And after the hype going into it, and after seeing how talented Bruce Campbell really is (Bubba Ho-Tep), this film just feels rather weak. Acting: 8/10 Story: 8/10 Atmosphere: 4/10 Cinematography: 6/10 Character Development: 6/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 5/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 0/10 Violence/Gore: 7/10 (not much of either, but decent quality for it) Dialogue: 7/10 Music: 6/10 Direction: 6/10 Cheesiness: 5/10 Crappiness: 1/10 Overall: 6/10 This one is for general Science Fiction fans and Bruce Campbell fans. But don't get your hopes up too high. Like, watch it if you forgot a lot of his previous work, or haven't seen it at all. Not bad, not great, and don't get your hopes too high.
