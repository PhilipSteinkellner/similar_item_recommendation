The pair naturally fail to get along at first, but as the investigation continues, they almost begin to come close to tolerating each other's presence.",

         "This movie will go down down in history as one of the greats, right along side of Citizen Kane, Casablanca, and On The Waterfront. Someone please convince Leno to do a sequel! Leno and Morita are a comedy duo, the likes of which haven't been seen since Abbot and Costello. The evil that emanates from Chris Sarandon, Tom Noonan, and Randall \"Tex\" Cobb will give you the chills. Dingman's character as the buffoonish oaf hearkens back to the days of Shakespeare's comedies. And the climax. My goodness, the climax. I won't ruin it for you, but it makes the explosion of the Death Star pale in comparison. If you can track down this hard-to-find gem, do yourself and your family a favor and buy it immediately. I'm still holding out hope for a special edition DVD one of these days.",
         "When I saw the cover of this movie on the $2 rack at Blockbuster video, I absolutely cacked myself laughing and had to buy it. After about two years of keeping it under a table leg to stop the wobble, I finally watched it. Now, it wasn't the best movie I've seen but it sure kept me entertained. Stereotypical, yes.. Lame, absolutely.. but it was so damn funny. The 80's style car chase, the way Jay Leno seemed to forget that he'd been shot in the leg, the cheesey ending... brilliant! It was fun, it was action packed and it brought a tear to my eye.My favourite part would have to have been Tony and the guy from Karate Kid sitting in the kitchen getting sloshed. If you come across this gem in the video store or if it's coming on tele, don't pass up the opportunity to watch it. As long as your expectations aren't too high, you'll love Collision Course.",

         "I saw this movie recently. 2 hours later, my head still hurt from laughing. The plot was soo awful, the jokes were soo bad, but what I didn't count on were: 1. the 2 scenes before and after the movie that had Pat and Jay posing (that caused more than enough laughter) 2. The kick through the windshield that decapitated the evil-doer. This movie is about 20 times better than the Rush Hour series, and my copy even came with a disclamer saying if you didn't like the movie, send certificate to HBO. While I considered it, the date you had to send it in was January 1991 (which also caused wackiness to ensue).",
         "Well no, I tell a lie, this is in fact not the best movie of all time, but it is a really enjoyable movie that nobody I know has seen. It's a buddy cop movie starring Jay Leno and Pat Morita(Mr Miyagi) with some fluff story about a missing car engine prototype or something, but that doesn't matter. the reason this movie is fun is because of the interaction between the two leads, who initially dislike and distrust each other but in a shocking twist of fate end up becoming friends. The whole culture difference thing is done quite well,in that it's fun to watch, it's completely ridiculous but in a cheesy and enjoyable kind of way. The soundtrack is cool,once again in a cheesy 80's kind of way, it suits the movie, I've been trying to find one of the songs for ages, but as I'm working from memory of what I think a few of the words were i can't seem to find it. Another thing this movie has is the most fantastic pay off of any movie ever, but I won't give that one away, oh no! In conclusion I'd take this movie over 48 Hours\\most of Eddie Murphys output including Beverly Hills cop, and whatever buddy junk Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence have to their names. If you're looking for a buddy cop movie and are getting fed up with \"straight white cop meets zany streetwise black cop\" give this a shot. You might be pleasantly surprised cos this turns the whole formula upside down with \"straight Japanese cop meets zany streetwise white cop\". I'm giving this 7. to be honest I like it more than that. I'd rather watch this than a lot of stuff I'd give 8. But I guess I know deep down that it's some sort of insanity that makes me like this movie.",
         "Really a funny movie that no one knew/knows about. I remember I first saw it on HBO when it was already 2-3 years old, about 92-93. Still, very funny. If you watch it you'll know. Now that I think about it, it's the first Rush Hour; white(instead of black) cop and a Chinese partner who can't speak English, but really can, have hardships through the movie, which makes it interesting and funny, then bond and become friends in the end. Cool, funny movie. 8/10 I'm repeating this, because I am starting out a new commenting title. So I think just repeating this will be better and have an overall justifiable expense. Thank you. And word to your mother. If you thought that was funny, please say so. I just did it on a whim and it cracked me a smile.",
         "Okay, I know I shouldn't like this movie but I do. From Pat Morita's loveable interpretation of a Japanese stereotype to Jay Leno's annoying yell, I laughed throughout this movie.As long as you take into account that this is not the best movie in the world, it's a good mvie. My favorite part is Morita talking to his boss in Tokyo with the drinking a close second.",
         "The movie is worth watching if you're from Detroit or are familiar with the area, as a lot of the city's highlights are featured as scenery. It's also decent if you just have to watch Jay Leno as an actor. But there's a reason he's a show host. Pat Morita never seems confident in his role as the visiting cop. It's a little comical at first, especially if one is only familiar with his roles in the Karate Kid movies and Happy Days. Jay Leno seems overly smug as the guy who's smarter than his superiors and they resent him for it. He must have had a lot of fun driving the cars he got to in the movie. Maybe they were his own, as he is a huge auto enthusiast. It's a very clichéd cop movie that's been done dozens of times. But, no movie captures Detroit better.",
         "i saw this movie on cable, it was really funny, from the stereotype police chief to the stereotype big bad guys, jay leno and mr mayagi from karate kid star in this good comedy about a prototype car part. I compare this movie to \"RUSH HOUR\" in which a local cop has to partner up with an asian police officer to solve a case. The chase through farmers market in downtown detroit brings back memories. Enjoyable soundtrack, good script, i give it 10/10.",
         "Centered in the downtown and out skirts of Detroit, this comedy I found to be a terrific new comedic duo. 'Noriyuki Pat Morita' is a very funny man, who happens to be a cop from Japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief, who has stolen a 'proto type' turbo super charger, reluctantly he goes to the United States to follow the thief, after being ordered by his commander. Pat's character collides with 'Jay Leno's' character, a fast talking' but down to business-player type Detroit cop. When they cross paths though, the honorable 'Ways' of Japan meet the all-out old school Detroit police investigative 'Ways'. The two stumble and trip over each other at first, but then develop a 'rythym' that turns into an explosive two layered powerhouse team, that solves the case, cold. After battling a city crime boss for the stolen 'equiptment' and closing the case, these two go from despising each other to being friends and working well together. A little worse for wear and in need of an extended-vacation on top of it all, they manage to come to a victorious closing. I rated this a 9. Lewis's direction makes' this a near perfect comedy. Fun for all ages. I recommend it highly.(***)"
