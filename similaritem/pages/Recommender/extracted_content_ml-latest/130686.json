      "synopsis": "The film starts with a trailer for an old school \"Friday The 13th\"-esque slasher film called \"Camp Bloodbath\", which features a group of counselors at Camp Blue Finch being terrorized by a masked killer named Billy Murphy (Dan B. Norris). Watching the trailer on her phone is Max Cartwright (Taissa Farmiga). Her mother Amanda (Malin Akerman) was one of the leads in that film. Max waits for her mom as she leaves an audition. Amanda is a bit discouraged since she feels she is only known for \"Camp Bloodbath\" and has thus been typecast. The two drive away with Max telling Amanda all the bills she has to pay. She puts on the radio, which is playing Kim Carnes' \"Bette Davis Eyes\", Amanda's favorite song. Max then accidentally spills her milkshake on Amanda's headshot, distracting Amanda and causing her to hit a car, and then roll against traffic cones and tumble hard across the deserted street. Three years later, Max is now living with her aunt. Her best friend Gertie (Alia Shawkat) picks her up to go study at a diner with their friend Chris (Alexander Ludwig). Gertie's stepbrother Duncan (Thomas Middleditch) enters and pleads with Max to attend a double feature for \"Camp Bloodbath\" and its sequel, \"Camp Bloodbath 2: Cruel Summer\". Since the show falls on the anniversary of Amanda's death, Max refuses, but Duncan eventually convinces her to show up as a special guest. The four go to the double feature. They encounter Chris's ex-girlfriend and Max's former best friend Vicki (Nina Dobrev), who becomes a nuisance to the friends. They later watch the first movie, which plays to a huge crowd. Max feels a bit emotional watching her mom on the screen again. In the crowd, two guys pass around a liquor bottle, which gets dropped and rolls across the floor, spilling booze everywhere. Another guy lights up a cigarette, and the ash falls onto the liquor, igniting it and setting a curtain on fire that eventually spreads through the whole theater. The audience runs for the exits, blocking it for Max and her friends. She grabs a sharp item and leads Gertie, Chris, Duncan, and Vicki toward the screen. Max cuts through the screen and they enter through a blinding white light. The friends find themselves in the woods, right at the start of \"Camp Bloodbath\". The main counselors - horny idiot Kurt (Adam Devine) and bimbo Tina (Angela Trimbur) - drive by the friends and ask where Camp Blue Finch is. Not realizing what happened, the friends let the counselors drive away from them. They wait over two 92-minute periods (the film's runtime, twice) before the counselors return and Duncan tells Tina they are also counselors and would like a ride to the camp. In the van, the friends meet another counselor, Blake (Tory N. Thompson), and Amanda, in character as Nancy, the \"shy girl with a clipboard and guitar\". The group arrives at Camp Blue Finch. Duncan tries to get Kurt to give him the keys to the van so they can find a way out of the movie, but Kurt tosses the keys into the woods. Max tries to get Nancy away from Kurt, because her character is fated to die after having losing her virginity to him. The five friends then go into the woods to look for the keys, just as the first kills in the film are set to take place. The five watch as Billy shows up and kills two horny counselors. Billy appears to spot them, and everyone except Duncan runs. He realizes that since they're not part of the movie, Billy doesn't know what to do with them. Duncan thinks he's invincible, until Billy hurls his machete into Duncan's side, apparently killing him, and proving to the other four that they have no immunity. The film's badass final girl, Paula (Chloe Bridges), shows up to the camp. Since she is the one that kills Billy at the end of the film, the friends decide to stick with her, while also trying to stop anyone from having sex so that Billy won't show up. Billy is mentioned, and Nancy tells his urban legend, taking Max and her friends into a black-and-white flashback to 1957 when Billy was a camper. He was always made fun of for being different and ugly, so he hid in an outhouse to escape the bullying. One camper throws firecrackers into the outhouse, burning Billy's face and scarring him. After eight months in the burn ward, Billy went back to camp to exact his revenge. Now wearing a creepy mask and wielding his machete, he murdered eight counselors (one for each month of his time in the ward). As the friends watch Billy's murders, some blood sprays on Gertie's face. When they return from the flashback, the counselors see the blood on her face. Paula and Kurt panic, and Paula drives them both away in her car. Duncan emerges alive, but he gets hit by the car. Paula crashes into a totem pole, ejecting Kurt from the passengers seat and causing him to die with all his bones breaking. Paula meets her end when her car explodes. Max and her friends then reveal to the surviving counselors that they are all in a movie and that they need a new final girl to kill Billy. They even made Tina put on a life jacket with mittens (she is fated to die after doing a striptease). Since the final girl has to be a virgin, everyone thinks it should be Max. Max says Nancy should be the new final girl, but Vicki comments that she can't be because of who her character is (shy girl with a clipboard and guitar). Nancy runs away crying, so Max goes to console her. She wants to have Nancy survive so that they can make it out of the movie together and perhaps start a new life for Nancy/Amanda. The gang prepares for Billy's arrival that night. Vicki apologizes to Max and Gertie for her behavior, because she used to be good friends with Max before Amanda's death, and Max shut Vicki out and became friends with Gertie, making Vicki feel jealous and hurt. The girls forgive Vicki. The cabin has been booby-trapped in anticipation of Billy. Tina, who is hopped up on Vicki's adderall, does a crazy striptease and flashes her breasts, summoning Billy to the cabin. As he walks toward the cabin, Tina panics and runs away, tripping over a string and getting her head caught in a bear trap. Chris sets off another trap as Billy enters, wherein a log swings from the ceiling and knocks Billy into some antlers on the door to impale him. Thinking they've won, Gertie and Blake kiss. However, Billy is still alive and he kills Blake. The others run upstairs where Billy chases them. The heroes shoot flaming arrows at Billy's chest. He knocks a bookcase on top of Gertie and Vicki, and then impales Gertie with his machete. Max, Nancy, and Chris flee while Vicki takes Gertie's hand and drops a bucket of lighter fluid from the ceiling, causing an explosion. This doesn't kill Billy, and he bursts out the window on fire and in slow motion. The three run away (still in slo-mo) until Billy grabs Chris's leg and breaks the slo-mo. Chris gets stabbed while Billy kidnaps Nancy. Max brings Chris into an abandoned chapel and stays with him so he won't die alone, but Max assures him that he won't die. She runs to find Nancy in Billy's barn. Max fights Billy, but gets stabbed. Nancy gets Billy off Max and they run back to the chapel. Nancy realizes that since only the final girl can kill Billy, it has to be Max. Max breaks down in tears and tells Nancy who she is outside of the movie and how Max wished she could make her mom's dream of becoming a star come true. Nancy tells Max that she knows where to find her. Nancy walks out of the chapel and does a striptease to summon Billy. The killer emerges and impales Nancy with his machete. Max then walks out and dukes it out with Billy, eventually taking his machete and chopping his head off. Chris walks over to Nancy as the sun rises and the credits roll. They share a kiss. The film's rating stamp shows up before the reel starts to break off. Max wakes up in a hospital with Chris in the bed next to her. She hears voices and pulls back the curtain to find Duncan, Gertie, and Vicki, all alive. Max asks if it was a dream, but Duncan disproves that by showing off his machete wound. The friends look outside the room to find a doctor and nurse about to get intimate. Billy then bursts through the window, as the friends realize they are in the sequel. Max wastes no time in grabbing the nearest item and running to fight Billy again.",

         "The Final Girls may appear to be another stupid campy horror spoof a la Scary Movie but rest assured, it's not. It's most comparable to The Cabin in the Woods, but while that movie deconstructed horror as a whole, The Final Girls' focus is specifically on slashers. It's about a slasher movie star and her daughter who get into a fatal car accident. The daughter survives and years later, her and her friends go to see the slasher movie her mother starred in, then something happens in the theater and somehow the group ends up in the film they were watching. It may sound dumb but all disbelief can easily be suspended due to the smooth transitions, clever dialogue, great acting, and characters you actually care about. Once they enter the \"movie\" world, it's simply a blast to watch. Slasher tropes are pointed out, made fun of, and even implemented well when necessary. The virgin girl is the only one who can kill the killer and it must be with his own machete. Sound familiar? Also, anyone who has sex ends up getting killed. Yeah, it's Friday the 13th all over again, except with a new cast. Every character has a personality and has their place in the movie. There's the jock douche, the slutty space cadet, the innocent shy girl, the hipster, you name it. They all work perfectly together, and it's hard to single out one actor as a highlight because the acting throughout is highly impressive for a horror movie. Mainly the two female leads (Max and her mom) have tangible chemistry and some truly heartfelt moments. So is The Final Girls scary? Not exactly, but does have some badass shots like the killer jumping out of a window in slo-mo while he and his machete are on fire, and someone actually dies by falling face first into a bear trap. Ouch. More importantly though, The Final Girls is funny without being dumb. It's clever humor, and it works around the plot so you have fun while being totally invested in the story. The most surprising thing about this movie is the amount of heart it has. Rarely do tearful personal conversations work in slashers, but here they make up some of the most powerful scenes. Simply put, The Final Girls is an adventure, and for any meta-horror comedy fans, it's one you should not miss.",
         "I am fresh off of watching this and wow, this was a lot of fun. I was afraid that this was going to turn out like every other recent film with a young cast and be riddled with MTV type clichés but it wasn't at all. The cast was great and film as a whole was pretty funny and brutal (for a PG-13 Film). The premise was great and original, they really came up with a clever way to spoof the 80's slasher genre. The sub plot was even well done and made for some fairly emotional scenes. The film worked on all levels and was blast to watch. I really enjoyed it It's weird but when I really like a film I find it hard to say a whole lot about it. When I hate a film I can shoot out four or five paragraphs no problem, but I enjoyed this film so much that I am finding it hard to come up with much to say. Just watch it. 8/10",
         "The combination of horror and comedy is always a volatile recipe, and the failure to mix those ingredients just right can often result in disaster. But every once in awhile, a film comes along that manages to stumble upon the secret formula for success, with Cabin in the Woods being the most recent example. Now, three years after that film blew the roof off the Paramount Theater at the SXSW Film Festival, we have another SXSW debut that premiered to a cacophonous ovation: director Todd Strauss-Schulson's The Final Girls. Max Cartwright (Taissa Farmiga) is struggling with loss after the tragic death of her mother, 80s slasher flick icon Amanda Cartwright (Malin Akerman). When she attends an anniversary screening of her mom's landmark film, Camp Bloodbath, a freak accident transports Max and her friends (Alia Shawkat, Alexander Ludwig, Thomas Middleditch and Nina Dobrev) into the film itself, where they're forced to abide by the rules of the movie's narrative in an attempt to survive. Of course, everyone knows that anyone who has sex in an 80s horror film is bound to be butchered shortly after, so Max finds herself in the awkward position of trying to convince her mother's character not to sleep with the cocky, swaggering Kurt (Adam Devine), whose dialogue is almost entirely made up of sexual innuendo. Meanwhile, the attractive but vapid Tina (Angela Trimbur) is constantly trying to disrobe, which is a big no-no in this film, since a pair of bare breasts will bring the masked killer and his machete running. Fans of the Friday the 13th or Sleepaway Camp series will find plenty to love here as the film gleefully pokes fun at genre tropes, and much of the fun comes from the fact that Max and her friends aren't just living in the world of the film - they're living in the actual film, complete with voiceovers, on screen credits, and flashbacks. There are so many hilarious moments that the film practically begs for repeated viewings, as audiences are bound to be laughing so hard that they'll miss some of the rapid-fire humor. There are a few times when The Final Girls gets a little too stylish, such as poorly rendered early scene that involves a bottle of vodka rolling across the floor of a crowded theater, and there are a few moments where the film seems to forsake its own rules in favor of an extra laugh. But these are minor complaints, and the audience at the Paramount Theater certainly didn't allow these nitpicks to detract from the overall experience. The Final Girls is an immensely fun experience that finds a great balance between being a spoof of the genre, and a love letter to its absurdity.",
         "The Final Girls is a very unique take on the ever growing meta horror sub-genre. It takes a group of characters and inserts them into a fictional 80s horror movie slasher, Camp Bloodbath. Once there they must try to not only return to the real world, but also survive the movie before being hacked to pieces by little Billy Murphy. And once in the movie we meet those lovable, clichéd characters that most of us are familiar with, the virgin (aka the final girl), the quiet shy girl (aka the cute girl who sadly doesn't survive), the sexy party girl (aka you have zero chance of surviving), the jock (aka the sexual deviant), the wannabe hero (aka you aren't the real hero so you're gonna die), and a few more body count extras. The movie for the most part is very funny, especially early on in the movie when we first meet the original characters in the movie. Everyone is so over the top when we first meet them that it's hard not to have a smile on your face at anytime they are speaking. Every conversation leads back to some sort of sexual innuendo and it's great. But then there are other times when we get some one on one time between a mother and her daughter and the movie is surprisingly touching and emotional during those moments. It's this aspect of the movie that gives the movie a pulse, you care about these characters (even if the movie isn't as dark and daunting as it seems to be). But that's not to say the movie is perfect, there are times when I found myself disappointed with the script and the direction the movie was taking. It's not that it was terrible, but there was so much room for a movie like this that I wish it had thrown in a few more ideas. After all the movie is barely 90 minutes long and I feel the majority of people wouldn't mind sticking around a bit longer to see some other ideas flourish. The Final Girls is one of the better movies to fly under the radar and if you count this as a horror movie (which it's very light on horror) it would certainly quality as one of the best of the year. Like I said, the movie packs a surprisingly emotional punch but also doles out plenty of zany mayhem to keep you interested. Hopefully this this movie is a big enough hit on VOD that it somehow gets a sequel because we all know sequels are bigger, badder, and crazier than the original, especially those wacky 80s slashers!",
         "If your an 80's Horror/Slasher FanBoy like myself then this film is for you. Clever nods to the audience, tongue n cheek, self aware/meta humour is in full force. Think the wit and humour of Scream blended together with Friday the 13th, plus some surprisingly emotional depth. Loved it! I cannot fathom why this did not get a cinema release, it is absolutely brilliant. A clever, knowing, (though never self mocking) homage to 80s slasher flicks. The cast are uniformly brilliant and great to see Nina Dobrev in something other than the Vampire Diaries. If you love Scream and the self referential horror you are sure to enjoy this. Give it a try, this will go down as another of those hidden gems that COME ALIVE on DVD, rather like 'Trick R Treat.' Neglected and ignored when in fact it is sheer brilliance and really quite moving. Lovely commentary too!",
         "Three years after the death of her actress mother Amanda (who really should have kept her eyes on the road), teenager Max (Taissa Farmiga) is talked into attending a showing of her mum's best known movie, cult '80s slasher Camp Bloodbath. When a fire breaks out in the theatre, Max and four of her school friends are forced to escape through the screen where they find themselves trapped inside the movie, stalked by its hulking, mask wearing, machete wielding killer, Billy Murphy. Written by M.A. Fortin and former actor Joshua Miller (who played the vampire kid in Near Dark), The Final Girls offers up no shortage of knowing clichés and clever meta-moments guaranteed to put a smile on the face of any self-respecting slasher fan: in order to improve their chances of survival, the pals must exploit their knowledge of slasher conventions, while dealing with such hurdles as black and white flashbacks and awkward moments of slow motion. Max also has the added issue of trying to preserve the life of camp counsellor Nancy, the character in the film that was played by her mother (a plot-line that adds genuine heart to the film). However, as ingenious as the script undoubtedly is, The Final Girls does miss the mark slightly by being a strictly PG-13 affair, director Todd Strauss-Schulson keeping the action free of the gore and nudity that is synonymous with '80s slashers. For the film to be absolutely true to the genre it is having so much fun with, there should have been at least one skinny dipping scene, some gratuitous sex, and a bit of decent splatter, but all it can offer is a few bloodless death scenes and a couple of the actresses in their underwear. For shame! 6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for having camp slut Tina dance to Cherry Pie by Warrant (such a good tune that I'm willing to turn a blind eye to the fact that it wasn't even released until 1990).",
         "The 80's slasher flicks are loved by horror fans more than any other sub-genre of horror because they were fun. What made them fun ? The inventive kills, the over the top bad dialogue, the campy mood, the silly acting, the music, the legendary killer, the gore , and the nudity. So can a PG-13 film successful spoof 80s slasher convention ? This film is proof that it can. You just have to realize that this is not a movie that pays homage to slasher films by recreating the same kind of film. Its a spoof of the silliness of 80s horror. The characters are all likable, and all the actors are well cast. The story line is very clever. And while it may not be the first movie to deconstruct and bend horror film rules, it is one of the best. Watch it in the right mindset and you will not be disappointed especially if your a fan of 80's slasher horror. Do not go in to this one expecting lots of gore and nudity, and you are in for a wicked surprise.",
         "The teenager Max Cartwright (Taissa Farmiga) misses her mother Amanda Cartwright (Malin Akerman), who died three years ago in a car accident. Amanda was a horror movies actress that has become famous because of her character Nancy in the cult slasher film \"Camp Bloodbath 1 & 2\". Max is invited by her friend Duncan (Thomas Middleditch), who is the brother of her best friend Gertie Michaels (Alia Shawkat), to participate in the lecture in the end of the session of \"Camp Bloodbath 1 & 2\" promoted by the fans in the movie theater. Max meets the handsome Chris Briggs (Alexander Ludwig), who has broken up with his girlfriend Vicki Summers (Nina Dobrev), and they stay together. Out of the blue, there is a fire in the theater and Max, Chris, Duncan, Gertie and Vicki try to escape through the screen. But soon they find that they are trapped in \"Camp Bloodbath 1\" with the characters Nancy, Kurt (Adam DeVine), Tina (Angela Trimbur) and Paula (Chloe Bridges) in the summer camp. Further, the serial-killer Billy Murphy (Dan B. Norris) is hunting them down. \"The Final Girls\" is an entertaining parody to slasher films that has potential to become cult-movie. The story entwines \"Friday the 13th\" or any other slasher in a summer camp with the idea of \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" (1985), repeated in \"Last Action Hero\" (1993) and \"Pleasantville\"(1998), where the viewer joins the characters in the film. There are many funny moments and Malin Akerman is so beautiful that convinces performing the role of the teenager Nancy. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): \"Terror nos Bastidores\" (\"Terror in the Backstage\")",
         "Are people going crazy giving this movie such a high rating? I can not imagine how they will score really good horror movies then. This is supposed to be a horror/comedy, or a parody of a horror movie, but besides Adam DeVine I really didn't see anybody funny in The Final Girls. It all starts with images of a really bad slasher B-movie and you start wondering if that's going to be the rest of the movie. But then you see it change into a normal movie and you are kind of relieved. But then they have the greatest dumb idea ever to project the whole cast into the slasher B-movie. It's too absurd for words. What follows then is just pointless efforts to make this movie into a parody of an old-school slasher. It's just embarrassing really. I really don't get why this movie gets such a rating.",
         "Reviewers Notes: 1. Prior to 1994, Quentin Tarantino was actually known as ... wait for it ... Quentin Tarantino. The event that transformed him into a film icon to be forever known simply as \"QT\" was of course Pulp Fiction. The record will show, members of the jury, that Pulp was not necessarily the best acted or best produced film at the time but what it had was the best script of the era, a script so sharp you could cut yourself merely by watching the film. Scripts that good, scripts written by insiders for outsiders wanting to feel like insiders, are rare. So rare they appear about once a decade. And this is the sharp script of the present era. 2. Once you grasp that the unfettered joy in watching this film is all about the script, you will appreciate that the performance of Taissa Farmiga is simply an unexpected bonus. Every film needs \"glue\" to keep both the characters and the audience grounded, and here she is the glue. But she is great glue. She has a sort of \"inner glow\" (a la early Rachel McAdams) and also a chameleon-like quality which keeps the audience interested. 3. The rest of the cast is great, but really this excellent film is a showcase for the Fortin/Miller screenplay and the constantly innovative direction of Todd Strauss-Schulson. Highly recommended.",
         "I was looking for an entertaining film to watch on Halloween, and I sure wasn't disappointed with THE FINAL GIRLS. The basic premise is that a group of friends at a horror marathon end up getting trapped in the movie itself and have to find a way to survive. Brilliant, right? Arguably the best part of the movie is the way that it makes fun of horror clichés, particularly those in the slasher genre. They also poke fun at the horrible writing and bad acting. Basically, it does for slasher films what CABIN IN THE WOODS did for \"cabin in the woods\"/Evil Dead-type films. The acting, even though some of it was intentionally bad, was decent. There weren't too many well-known actors, so nobody really stood out in that respect. I did recognize Taissa Farmiga and Malin Akerman, and for what it's worth, they did well. However, my favorite character was the dumb blonde. She provided the most laughs for me. Adam Devine was OK, but it reminded me too much of his work in PITCH PERFECT. From a technical standpoint, everything was rather solid. Camera-work was good, and I thought they did a good job toning down R-rated violence for a PG-13. They even get a good joke out of using black-and-white for a flashback sequence. All things considered, THE FINAL GIRLS was a clever genre sendup that makes mostly good use out of the material its parodying. To sweeten it further, there were a couple of scenes that seemed stolen from my dreams, as Taissa Farmiga's character and I have something in common that I won't spoil for those who haven't seen the film. Let's just say there was one part that got me a little emotional. The only thing that keeps me from going higher with the rating is that the film kind of backs off from a \"your destiny is up to you\" message and falls back on the clichés it had been making fun of up to that point. Other than that, I thought it was an easy watch with plenty of laughs that should entertain most viewers who are into horror movies.",
         "Tries to be \"the last action hero\" of slasher movies... Dude, what a bad sh*tload of bad. Not funny, not scary, not gory. Nothing but \"not\". It had 7/10 on IMDb when I watched it, which had to be bought. I honestly cant't picture a scenario where anyone would give a boring mess like this more than 5/10 (and that would be someone who sleeps with the director, I guess). It has it all, a mess of a script, bad acting, a forest of wooden dialog, unfunny \"funny\" one-liners which tries so hard to be funny and cool, that you are one second away from jumping in the screen yourself and offing those suckers yourself just to make the world a better place... A Monster who has nothing original to it. I mean, it is a copy of a copy of a copy of every bad- breath-slasher-Killer you have ever seen. And his kills are totally UNGORY. Duh? You read correct. I mean, I'm not a gore hunter. I can enjoy all kinds of movies, with or without violence. But if you are shooting a picture where the poor folks who you hired to play the poor folks that get sucked INTO a horror-slasher-movie are offed by the killer off-screen, than you have no idea what you are doing. I could get on and on... SO DON'T WATCH IT!!! You will have to see it anyway over and over again, if you are going to hell. So avoid that better too.",
         "I got the impression that THE FINAL GIRLS was advertised as a horror/comedy satirizing tropes from the early generation of slasher films from the 80's. And it was, to an extent, but it's mostly the heartfelt tale of a daughter mourning the loss of her mother and learning to let her go. That would've been good to know because I went in with a particular expectation that was let down pretty thoroughly. The mother/daughter team at the core of THE FINAL GIRLS is Malin Akerman and Taissa Farmiga. Amanda (Akerman) was a struggling actress who's one big hit was the cult classic slasher film CAMP BLOODBATH from the mid 80's, a Friday THE 13TH sort of horror film where she was a shy camp counselor who was hacked to bits by the machete-wielding maniac Billy Murphy (Dan B. Norris) after losing her virginity. Amanda dies in a car crash and her daughter Max (Farmiga) is still having problems coping three years later. When she's invited to a double-feature screening of CAMP BLOODBATH and its sequel as a special guest on the anniversary of her mother's death, she reluctantly agrees. Things get weird when a series of freak occurrences cause a fire in the theater and Max and her friends are forced to escape through the screen, finding themselves awakening moments later in the film. Trapped at Camp Blue Finch with a bunch of horny counselors and a murderous psychopath on the loose, Max and her friends must convince the film's characters of the danger they're in and devise a plan to escape back to the real world. Of course, it's made all the more difficult for Max when she comes face-to-face with her \"mother\" in the character of Nancy, the shy counselor with a guitar who's doomed to become a victim. THE FINAL GIRLS might be better than I'm giving it credit for but I was personally disappointed in the end result. I sat down expecting something more along the lines of TUCKER AND DALE VS. EVIL with a focus on lampooning the clichéd elements of the Jason Voorhees franchise. THE FINAL GIRLS does this and, when it does, the movie is pretty fun. But, and I hate to sound cold-hearted, whenever the movie focuses on the mother/daughter angle, I get bored. It's disappointing enough that the movie is PG-13 so we get none of the bloody violence and gratuitous nudity associated with the slasher films it's poking fun at, but to then constantly downshift the pace to accommodate the Max/Nancy plot thread is rough. We kept injecting these heartwarming moments with Max assuming the more parental role for the eager-to-get-busy Nancy as she tries to keep the clueless teenaged counselor's clothes on, educating her on the fact that she doesn't have to sleep with the lecherous Kurt (Adam DeVine) just because he wants it. Look, the Akerman/Farmiga stuff works really well. Both of these women are great actresses and they've got some excellent chemistry here as mother and daughter (or \"camp friends\"), but it feels like we're bouncing between two separate movies and I found it increasingly annoying. Between the movie's heart, the toothless horror elements, and the hit-or-miss comedy, THE FINAL GIRLS only worked on the one level (Akerman/Farmiga) and everything else suffered. It wasn't nearly suspenseful enough to qualify as any sort of horror movie. The kills were mostly tame (with two exceptions\u0085one involve a car and the other a bear trap) and Billy Murphy\u0085the Jason Voorhees stand-in\u0085 wasn't all that scary with his big ol' tiki mask looking like something out of the Scooby-Doo movie. The comedy fared a little better but it still came up short. THE FINAL GIRLS never elicited more than a half-hearted chuckle out of me but what comic relief we were provided helped the movie pass a little smoother. The supporting cast includes Thomas Middleditch (from the fantastic HBO show \"Silicon Valley\") as the resident CAMP BLOODBATH super-fan Duncan, Adam DeVine (form Comedy Central's \"Workaholics\") as the camp's sex-obsessed jock Kurt, and Angela Trimbur as the horniest counselor of the bunch, Tina. The three of them provide the funniest moments of the movie and almost every scene with them (especially Middleditch and Trimbur) is great. I also loved how the filmmakers created the world of the movie-within-a-movie. Once Max and her friends are dumped into the world of CAMP BLOODBATH, they're trapped and any attempt to escape circles right back around to the camp. On-screen title cards are physical three- dimensional objects that they can interact with, and flashbacks are a trippy journey into the black-and-white world of the late 50's. Even with the toned- down PG-13, I could've loved this film purely for the creativity involved if we'd gone the comedic route, spending more time building laughs on the inherent goofiness of slasher films viewed through modern cynical eyes. Or we could've gone the other direction and taken a hard R-rating with the horror angle. Either way I feel we still could've found a way to incorporate the very personal tale of Max and Nancy, and then we'd have had more fun in the meantime. But it is what it is, and THE FINAL GIRLS is a decent 90 minute distraction but little more for me.",
         "This film has one hell of a premise that immediately grabbed my attention. It features the exact blend of comedy and horror that I love and that so rarely filmmakers do right. The severely underrated Club Dread is a perfect example of how so many people can miss the intended humour. Then you have hits like Tucker & Dale vs Evil, which not only is a great premise, but is also both hilarious and a bloody good time. People either seem to love or hate these films and it's most likely because it's so hard to balance the two genres. When done right, it's gold, when done wrong, it's terrible. The Final Girls, for the most part, lands on the good side of the spectrum. Max, loses her mother in a car accident and 3 years to the day, is invited to a screening of her late mother's most famous film, a cheesy 80's horror flick called Camp Blood. During the screening the theatre catches fire, so Max and her friends have to escape and cut right through the theatre screen. Next thing they know, they're in the movie. The exact same movie her mother appears in, which now gives Max a second opportunity to be with her mother, only if she survives the deranged killer roaming the woods. The film has a great opportunity to capitalize on a lot of horror clichés, much like the way The Cabin in the Woods did brilliantly. One character in particular, a Randy Meeks of horror films, is the perfect opportunity to connect the film characters with the viewer at home. What would Randy do if he were literally transported into the film Scream? This was an interesting approach that I hoped the filmmakers would take. They don't. They kind of walk the line, but they are pretty inconsistent with things. Being in the horror film and knowing how it ends is perfect fodder for comedy gold. The film did make me laugh, many times, but I wanted to laughs to be really enjoyable. Instead I chuckled a lot throughout the film. Instead of being a comedy, the film has a surprising amount of drama thrown in. Max has an opportunity to reunite with her mother, only the person in the movie isn't her mother, she's the character her mother plays in the film. Again, great set ups for comedy gold, yet we get mild humour. I little disappointing on that end, but still enough comedy in the film to make me smile. The filmmakers throw some interesting aspects of the genre at the viewers and the characters. The characters can actually hear the \"ch ch ch cha cha cha\" that accompanies a nearby victim or a flashback that transports the character even further back in time. Title cards that they can interact with, a specific time line of events to unfold. Every 92 minutes, things start over again because that is the length of the film. These things are clever and make for a unique viewing experience. One of the biggest problems with the film is that it doesn't go far enough with the material. It's held back by the rating. The film features very little gore and no nudity. These things are staples of the horror genre, especially the 80's slasher films that the film is parodying. If the film has embraced these things and given us an R rated comedy, then it would have been a lot better. It felt restrained in a sense. Not a wasted opportunity, not at all. The film is good and those who enjoy these types of movies will surely have a good time. I just think the possibilities could have been so much more. They had a great idea and didn't try and take it any further beyond that. This film easily, could have been one of my favourites of the year, instead it settles for being just a good movie. If you ever sat down and thought to yourself, Pleasantville as a horror film would be brilliant. This film is for you.",
         "I thought the premise of this film sounded fantastic and after watching the trailer i thought that it looked really funny.....not so much... I did chuckle now and again but i expected so much more. I felt for Max and i could sympathise with her as I've also felt that same loss but i still didn't find myself rooting for her, Taissa Farmiga acts the exact same in everything i have ever seen her in and it is starting to bug me, she just pulls the same expressions constantly and it would be nice to see her in a different role to see if i'm wrong. I didn't really warm to very many of the characters but out of the bunch Malin Akerman's Amanda was definitely the best and most of the laughs were caused by the character Tina (slutty girl). The two scenes i enjoyed the most were both of those characters dancing to their individual songs. I won't say anymore than that though as i don't want to spoil anything for anyone. I also found the flashback scenes and the slow motion scenes to be very entertaining and i loved the films overall look but unfortunately that was all. It mostly fell flat for me, mostly because they were trying too hard to be funny and most of the jokes just aren't. During the end credits there was a blooper reel and they are some of the un-funniest bloopers i have ever seen. I cringed. This film really had the potential to be something great so i am definitely disappointed.",
         "Nancy is an actress who gained notoriety for starring in the 80s slasher Camp Bloodbath. Now she can't find work because everyone associates her with that role. After an audition she and her daughter Max drive back. Max points out that they are in debt but Nancy just goofs off. They crash. Three years later Max is in college and we learn that Nancy died in the accident. It's the day of a double feature of Camp Bloodbath 1 and 2. One of Max's friends begs her to go and also signs her up for the Q&A. We also meet all her other ugly friends who show up for the movie. It's one of those theater were kids show up with bottles of alcohol and smoke cigarettes... That can only lead to disaster and sure enough, the theater bursts into flames. Our friends escape through the silver screen and end up...in Camp Bloodbath. At first confused, they quickly learn that they have to let the movie play out instead of interfering or trying to escape, which they can't. Max meets her teenage mom out to lose her virginity. The plot of the movie is of course that everyone who has sex dies. The virgin is the final girl and gets to kill the killer. So Max implores Nancy to keep her clothes on. Quickly they meet the killer, Billy. They think they are immune from him but one of them learns the hard way that they aren't. When the actual final girl from the movie arrives, she quickly manages to get herself killed in a car crash, that forces our gang to devise a plan to kill Billy themselves and somehow return to the real world. There's a lot to like in The Final Girls for those who enjoy slashers and 80s throwback movies. While it's never fun to see characters in a theater watching a movie, here's it's relatively short. Once they are inside the movie things are handled well. The 80s world is so stereotypical it almost seems like a criticism of the heavy reliance of 80s movies on stereotypes. A lot here is very witty and entertaining. And it's got the lovely Malin Akerman in the best role I've seen her yet where she gets to be cute and sweet. And the scenes of her singing and dancing are fantastic. Chloe Bridges is also gorgeous but gets a sorry short role, why didn't she get the lead role? That brings me to my first criticism. The bipolar casting. On the one hand the got Akerman, Briges, Dobrev, and Ludwig. But then they got the rest, a bunch of uggos starting with the lead on whose face the camera unfortunately spends endless time and in close-ups. That said everyone does a great job acting, but why settle when surely you can get a great looking cast. The second and more important problem is that this movie is PG-13, which for an 80s-inspired-and-themed slasher, is moronic and inexcusable. How many more horror movies will have to be ruined by short-sighted and incompetent executives and occasionally writer/directors? It just doesn't work. There's no nudity, gore, violence, which makes the horror aspect far less threatening and frightful. While the production apparently contributed a lot info to IMDb, notice that budget and box office info is mysteriously missing. Something tells me the whole PG-13 idea backfired. A lesson I hope they'll learn for the sequel.",
         "Yes! The Final Girls is real good. There, now go see it! OK, then. I'll say some stuff. The Final Girls is entertaining from the very first frame. Just a fun ride from start to finish. It is very well made, there is a ton of well known faces. (at least for most of us) The atmosphere is just aces! So good. So nice and cozy. It's one part Friday the 13th, one part Last Action Hero, and that's a fun little mix I'll tell ya! It's a feel-good-slasher. It's very visually appealing, and you really get the feeling that you are in a movie. Well, that they are in a movie. That you are in a movie in a movie, with them. You see what I'm saying? And here is one thing that sets The Final Girls apart from a lot of other slashers and horror-comedies: It has heart. A good chunk too. And good acting. There is this one scene in slo-mo - So cool! Just wanted to say it. No reason. The only thing that could have made it better would be, of course, gore and blood. For some reason it's PG13, so we get little blood, no nudity and no swearing. But it still manages to be entertaining as hell, and that's saying something. (If we are real nice, maybe Santa will bring us an unrated version?) So, do I have to say more now? Huh? Go watch it!",
         "I have to say that this movie surprised me in every way imaginable. My expectations were not very high when first viewing the trailer, but after watching the film i couldn't help but laugh, cry, cringe, laugh and cry all within the first three acts of this film. This is truly a fun homage to 70's to 90's horror/comedy films... A lot better in my opinion than the \"Scream\" franchise. The plot of this movie if you haven't seen the trailer or heard much buzz about the film is simple... A group of kids are accidentally pulled into a horror/teen slasher comedy. That is all i will say about this film... I feel you'll have more fun watching with less information. Please watch and enjoy!!!!!",
         "I am in no way defending the dreaded dung heap of 80's slasher films which came out during my teen years. While there are some gems, most of them are bad. That's just a fact. But, if you're going to do a satire on those films, you should at least get off your lazy butt and do it right. I found myself wondering if the makers of \"The Final Girls\" actually ever watched one of those flicks, or did they merely garner their collective \"wit\" from watching other clueless satires on older horror films, because this movie seems like its made by people who have no concept of the sub-genre they targeted. First off, if you're going to make a film which supposedly was shot in the 80's, shoot it on film! That cheap digital video with some filters doesn't cut it, bro. I can imagine some schlep working on the color correction for weeks to give it that film \"look\"? Nope.

So when you're little film has none, you're making a PC version which doesn't cut it. Third, the entire plot with the dead mother was excruciatingly lame. I realize the writers had to think up enough stuff to fill out a 90 minute film, but killing off the funniest characters (tall geek, fat obnoxious jock and the original final girl) and leaving us with the most boring, hackneyed stereotypes for the rest of the film was a stroke of idiocy which somehow complemented this steaming pile.",
         "To be honest I tried so hard not to like this film. Well not at first, at first I thought \"cool another HORROR COMEDY\", but then when it started and I glimpsed the set-up I really felt that I was not gonna like this film. At first I thought the introduction to the protagonists was hokey, then when we see how the story comes about with the cast entering the fictional film playing at the theatre I thought-\"WTF? Am I suppose to buy this?\". It was a bit of an issue with me, eating at me through pretty much the whole film-I really wanted to know the \"HOW\". Oh well, that being said, Schulson's creativity, and fresh spin on the horror spoof is so well executed that I couldn't help but enjoy the ride. The character contrast between our \"real cast\" and the \"fictional cast\" is so entertaining, especially with the comedy side of \"The Final Girls\". The cliché horror stereotypes meeting the somewhat \"real world\" cliché characters captured my attention. The seasoned acting between the up-and-coming Hollywood stars and the star- wattage of seasoned stars like Malin Akerman and Nina Dobrev is pure candy. The real star in this film is the script! The writing is just so good that even the things that irritated me, held my attention. The scenes are so emotional, dark, humorous, and visual - just perfectly done. Kudos to the crew and cast of \"The Final Girls\" on all that! The special effects were \"Hollywood\". What can you say, the practical effects, make-up skill, and CGI are so well produced that you get both a indie slasher homage, and total 80's popcorn effect. The CGI is done in a way that makes it as enjoyable as the splatter gore practical effects-that is a big \"yay\" for me because CGI tends to be a bummer personally when watching horror films. This time it all just worked perfectly. The soundtrack is methodical and precise. It plays on 80 slasher nostalgia and really connects you to the atmosphere of the scenes-both the campy \"characters in a fictional horror film and knowing it\" aspect, and the actual intimate, emotional relationship scenes that really develop the characters. Overall \"The Final Girls\" really comes close to hitting on all cylinders as the perfect slasher spoof. There is still that annoying \"HOW\" that lingers through the film, the almost too obvious and expected \"Hallmarky\" moments, and the fact that you pretty much know exactly how the scenes are gonna play out, and the general reaction from the characters, because it has to play out that way because it was set up to play out that way. Still the masterful way that Todd Strauss-Schulson pulls all the sweet and savory horror, and comedy stuff together in a visually delightful film- and don't forget the writing and cast- all just make \"The Final Girls\" a really fun and awesome viewing experience that fans should really enjoy!",
         "Slasher parodies, '80s throwbacks or homages \u0085 Call it whatever you want, but fact remains that horror comedies form a delicate sub-genre and it's extremely difficult to make one that does justice to both the comedy as well as the horror aspects. We primarily get to see zombie comedies, and they pretty much all suck tremendously, but lately there have been quite a lot of attempts to spoof the typical '80s slasher genre, although the ambitious young writers/directors usually prefer to call them \"tributes\" in order not to offend the die-hard slasher fan base (yours truly included). And they are damn right to be careful, because even though us, '80s slasher fanatics, are very much aware of the fact that most of them are terribly bad and amateurish, we still love them a lot! The principal gimmick in \"The Final Girls\" is that a group of 2015 teenagers are catapulted back in time and end up on the scene of a non-existent '80s slasher movie called \"Camp Bloodbath\". Admittedly the idea is refreshing and holds a lot of potential, but still the first thing that went through my twisted mind was: \"Damn, I'd rather just watch a real '80s slasher called \"Camp Bloodbath instead of this!\" But hey, as said, the basic plot concept is interesting and the film does contain a handful of creative elements and unexpected twists, so I must state that I overall enjoyed \"The Final Girls\" and don't regret watching it. The cute Max (Taissa Farminga from the first season \"American Horror Story\") lost her mother in a stupid car accident \u2013 paying attention to the road could have been an option \u2013 three years ago and understandably still misses her a lot. She was an unsuccessful actress who forever remained linked to her role as naive virgin in a cheesy '80s slasher movie called \"Camp Bloodbath\". That movie somehow became a cult hit and Max reluctantly accepts to attend a special screening of the film in the presence of her friends. When fire breaks out in the theater, Max and her friends try to escape by cutting a hole in the cinema screen and \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 inexplicably end up in the eighties and at the entrance of Camp Blue Finch where the events of the movie are about to start. Max knows that her teenage mother is supposed to die at the hands of a maniacal killer called Billy, but she intends to save her and messes up the whole original scenario. \"The Final Girls\" sounds like a lot of cheesy undemanding fun, and it is, as long as you don't think too much and set aside all the \"rules\" of time-traveling, paradoxes and film-in-film narrative structures. Personally I liked how the script almost promptly eliminates a couple of dreadful clichés (like \"tough chicks don't die\" or even getting rid of the annoying \"horror geek\" quite fast) but deeply regretted that the film doesn't contain any gratuitous nudity or gory massacres. I reckon the fact it's a PG-13 flick, but these two ingredients are essential and mandatory in case you're referring to eighties horror cinema.",
         "Trash. That's what I thought it would be. However, I watched it because I was suffering Nina Dobrev withdrawal since she left The Vampire Diaries. This movie proved me wrong on so many levels. It was fun, clever, and something that seems largely absent in Hollywood nowadays -- ORIGINAL! The cast was good in their roles. The lead did a great job on the touching scenes with her mother, who didn't know she was her mother until the end of the film. I gave this movie a 7-star rating. I would give it higher, but I do reserve 8, 9, and 10-star ratings for films that are really superb. Though, I really did like this movie. I recommend it to anyone who likes 80s horror films as well as horror spoofs. I will say that this is probably the best horror spoof I've ever seen. Most of them have lame writing, acting, and production value. This was really fun.",
         "Some things are a complete bust. This is one. Youth are sucked inside a movie during a screening, a hypothetical b-horror slasher from the 80s (a thinly veiled Friday the 13th actually). It's so thin in self-reference it makes the one-note Purple Rose of Cairo seem multilayered, so obvious in the ironic jabs it makes Scream appear subtle. We are actually inside a movie with a bunch of 80s caricatured characters and a masked killer. A lot of that would have been mitigated perhaps if it showed the hand of someone working from a passionate love for the opportunity to rearrange. I get overbearing preciousness instead. A precocious maker who really wants us to think this is the cutest thing ever. A girl meets her departed mother inside the movie, their every exchange cries \"isn't this the most moving thing ever and such a great idea of me to put in the movie?\". It turns its nose up at sexist stereotypes of the time yet has no problem with turning the slutty cheerleader character into a drooling imbecile for our amusement. It's a daft thing. It does show \"heart\" as others say; the Hallmark card kind. Clever in a twee way. Watch Moonrise Kingdom again, this isn't worth knowing.",
         "Thee are a lot of words that seem to come up in every review of this movie, \"love letter\", \"loving homage\", \"satirical\", etc etc. Yes, this movie fits into most of those categories quite firmly. This is, for sure, a loving homage to the 80s slasher film and, most particularly, the Friday THE 13th series. However, this is nothing revolutionary and, in fact, seems to be a mini-genre within horror that is spiraling out of control with carbon copies. You could swing this trend back to SCREAM, but I would submit that it started more recently. There was the cult success of BEHIND THE MASK, followed by CABIN IN THE WOODS and TUCKER & DALE VS EVIL and, all of a sudden, we seem to have a glut of movies where the characters are well aware of the conventions of the horror movie and the director gives continual winks and nods to the audience, knowing that we know that they know we're watching a horror movie. At this point, you could almost make a spoof of the spoofs. That makes me look at these movies with a more critical eye. It's not enough, anymore, to satisfy me with the clever nods to horror history. You need to craft something different. I will admit, right out, that this movie does try to do just that. It attempts to create a horror spoof with a lot more \"heart\" than is typical in the genre, but it also may be the one thing that had me losing interest as the plot developed. The premise is that our main heroine is the daughter of an actress who can't seem to escape the type casting from having appeared in \"Camp Bloodbath\", a slasher classic. After an accident, we flash forward a few years to our heroine struggling to deal with loss. She is invited to a screening of her mother's movie, at which events happen that suck our heroine and a few friends into the movie itself. I may be expecting far too much from a horror film, but I was disappointed in the explanation for how they end up in the movie. It makes no logical sense, but again I know I'm expecting too much there. Once in the movie, the next half hour or so of the film is actually really clever. They are, quite literally, in the movie, which causes a few fun gags. The words that appear on screen actually have dimension and the characters have to hop over them. The flashbacks take place with dripping fluid that brings our characters into a black and white world. They can hear the voice-overs and sounds effects. Naturally, the characters from this movie within the movie take on the classic genre clichés. There is the idiot jock, the slut, the outcast guy, etc, who all fill their types to the maximum. For a good chunk of the run time, this movie is actually really clever and I found myself giggling more than once at in jokes and fun moments. The killer himself is very noticeably a nob to Jason and makes little attempt to mask his homage. Even the costume is almost identical, except for the mask itself. I felt, though, that they could have used the killer more in the movie. His screen time is relatively small and the in jokes could have been used more effectively if they integrated the killer a little more, in my opinion. Where the movie starting losing me is about halfway through, as the plot starts meandering farther away from the horror homage and focusing more on the mother/ daughter relationship that develops between our heroine and her mom, who doesn't even realize she is the mother, of course, she's just a character in this movie within the movie. The script starts trying far too much to inject these \"tender moments\" and develop some emotion and drama into the movie. It starts treading dangerously close to \"chick flick\" territory in the final act, which isn't a bad thing in itself, but it starts losing the threads it was trying to develop in the first half of the movie. This is heightened, I think, by the PG-13 rating, which to me makes no sense in this context. To create a true homage to the 80s slasher should definitely have involved a great deal more blood. This is where BEHIND THE MASK gets so many things right because when you go beyond the clever homage to the slasher, that movie is an effective slasher in its' own right, having truly terrifying moments and some good gore. I would submit SHAUN OF THE DEAD, as well. It's a great comedy, but it works so effectively because it has moments of, also, being a gory, chilling zombie movie. This film never quite reaches those moments where we really feel like we're in a classic slasher, other than the fact that they keep telling us we are. What exactly is the point of making a limited release, direct to video movie PG-13? Who were you marketing this to? T It's really a shame because this movie brushes greatness. It has moments that are really inspired and made me love what they were doing. It's obviously the work of true Friday THE 13th fans. There are online rumors that the studio forced them into developing the emotional strands that bring this movie down in the end, but this movie would have been far better had they developed the homage more and left the tender mother/ daughter moments on the cutting room floor."
