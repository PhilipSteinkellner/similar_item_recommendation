         "content": "> A tale of a father who stood by his daughter till the final.\r\n\r\nThe zombie apocalyptic drama that centres around a father-daughter relationship. When the daughter is infected by the necroa virus which turns humans into the cannibalistic, the loving father stands by her side, but how long is the remaining film.\r\n\r\nOne of the blacklisted screenplay and a low budget film that surprised me for having Arnie on-board. Chloe Grace Moretz was supposed to play the title character, would have been definitely a perfect fit. Because I've seen her excellence in the 'Carrie' remake, anyway her replace Abigail Breslin did perform well.\r\n\r\nI had seen many movies of Arnold Schwarzenegger, but as I remember this is the first time seen him in a casual, realistic and emotional outfit. Maybe his age is restricting him from taking up the tough roles to play as what he was known for, but still I'm happy that he's doing movies that fits him right now.\r\n\r\nFor the one reason it is called a horror and you know why, but it was not horrifying. A slow paced simplest zombie movie. Enjoyable film for the sake of the cast, yet forgettable and move on kind of flick.\r\n\r\n6Â½/10",

      "synopsis": "We hear the voice of Maggie Vogel (Abigail Breslin) calling her father. She's trapped in the city as a curfew is in effect. She urges him not to go looking for her, and she tells him she loves him. Most of the global population has been plagued by the Necroambulist virus that turns people into flesh-eating zombies. Farmers have burnt down their fields and crops to prevent further contamination. Maggie's father Wade (Arnold Schwarzenegger) goes out searching for his daughter. Maggie is taken by armed officials and placed in an area at the hospital with other infected people. She has a bite wound on her arm, and the infection is going to gradually spread throughout her body. Wade is allowed to take Maggie home to settle her affairs until the virus progresses to the point where she must be quarantined. On the trip back, they stop at a store for Maggie to get sunglasses. Wade encounters a zombie and breaks its neck. Wade brings Maggie home to his wife/Maggie's stepmother Caroline (Joely Richardson) and her siblings Bobby and Molly (Aiden and Carsen Flowers). The children are sent to stay with their aunt until Maggie's issue is dealt with. She talks to Bobby, who more or less knows what's going to happen to her. Wade burns his field down. Maggie stays in her room, trying to contact her friends and attempting to ignore her situation. One afternoon, she cuts her finger and starts oozing black fluid. Fearing the worst, Maggie cuts off the finger and throws it in the garbage disposal. She retreats outside where she and Wade find a man named Nathan and his daughter Julia, both completely transformed from the infection. Wade kills Nathan with a hatchet, and Maggie runs away to Caroline before she sees what Wade does to Julia. Wade feels extreme remorse for what he had to do, though nobody blames him, but they do remind him of what he'll have to do with Maggie when the time comes. Wade visits the wife/mother of the zombies, Bonnie (Rachel Whitman Groves), who regrets not leaving her husband and daughter locked up, but also did not trust having them quarantined, as the doctors treated Julia like a test subject and not a person. Wade sees a doctor who gives him three options on what to do with Maggie. One, he can take her to quarantine immediately, which he refuses to do. Two, he can give her a cocktail that they would give her in quarantine, so that at least she would do it with her father by her side and not with a bunch of strangers. The doctor states that it would be extremely painful for her up until the end. The third option is to \"make it quick\". Wade decides to make the most of his last days with Maggie. They bond together, making fun of Caroline's cooking and talking about Maggie's biological mother. Maggie's friend Allie (Raeden Greer) visits her and invites her to hang out with friends. They gather around a bonfire, along with a boy named Trent (Bryce Romero), who is also infected. He says he would blow his brains out if he needed to. Maggie spends some alone time with Trent, culminating in a kiss between the two of them. At the end of the night, Allie brings Maggie home, and Allie cries alone in her car. Maggie's eyes start to lose their color, and she starts to claim that she smells food when Caroline denies there being any sort of smell. She then goes to Trent's home to find his father holding a gun at Trent's bedroom door. The boy knows it's time for him to get quarantined, but he refuses to come out. Maggie tries talking him down as the authorities enter the house and forcibly take Trent away from his father. Maggie's condition starts to get worse. She goes into the woods and encounters a small fox. She later runs back into her home with her face caked in blood. Maggie mentions the fox to her parents. Wade goes into the woods and finds the fox in pain, and he shoots it. Caroline urges Wade to call the authorities in to take Maggie away. A couple of officers do show up later, but Wade fights one of them. Maggie comes in and assures them that she is fine so that they won't take her away. Wade takes Maggie to a garden that belonged to her mother where she planted white daisies. It is the last thing that Wade can show her to make her feel some sort of peace. He tells her that she is not going anywhere. Maggie is almost completely zombified. Wade sits in the living room with his shotgun, not quite ready to use it. Maggie walks downstairs, her skin all grey and her eyes blackened. She sees her father sleeping, holding the gun. She goes over to him and kisses his forehead one last time. She then goes to the roof of the house and thinks about her mother. Maggie jumps off the roof, and the last thing she appears to see is her as a child frolicking through the flowers with her mother.",

         "Arnold Schwarzenegger's return to the big screen following his eight-year stint as the Governor of California was met with a triumphant cheer from fans of the ridiculous, over-the-top action movies that the Austrian actor helped popularize. Cranking out testosterone-laced like The Expendables 2, Escape Plan and Sabotage, it seemed like Arnold hadn't missed a step during his big- screen hiatus. But amid all the gunfire and explosions and catchphrases, Schwarzenegger also managed to find time for some genuine acting. Set against the backdrop of a small Midwestern town in the aftermath of a deadly pandemic that produces zombie-like symptoms, Maggie opens with quiet family man Wade (Schwarzenegger) driving into the city to pick up his daughter (Abigail Breslin), who has just been diagnosed with the virus. Unlike The Walking Dead, whose characters would resolve this problem with a well-placed shot from a crossbow or pistol, the world of Maggie is much more humane. There are numerous protocols in place for keeping the virus contained, including setting aside a quarantine zone where the infected are sent to live among each other until their condition deteriorates to the point where they must be euthanized. Still in the early stages of infection, Maggie is allowed to return home with Wade, with the admonishment that she be taken to the quarantine zone once her symptoms become worse. Maggie's stepmother (Joely Richardson) sends her own children to stay with relatives as a precautionary measure, and the ramshackle farmhouse becomes a cradle of tension and sorrow as the family bides their time waiting for the inevitable. If you strip out the zombie-related elements, this could just as easily have been any number of films about a teenager with a terminal illness - the only real difference here is that Maggie's affliction leaves her prone to grey skin, wounds that won't heal and a desire to consume raw flesh. Downplaying the horror in favor of focusing on the familial drama is a superb choice, and lends the film a distinct voice in the cacophony of an already crowded genre. Maggie is easily the most emotional and melodramatic work of Schwarzenegger's career, a somber and melancholy affair that showcases a range we've never seen from the aging action superstar. His on screen relationship with Breslin feels authentic and believable, and it's hard not to sympathize with a loving father who knows his child is slipping away. In his directorial debut, Henry Hobson knows just when to pull at the audience's heartstrings. There's very little in the way of conventional horror, which might disappoint some genre fans hoping for a few scares, but this shouldn't be seen as a shortcoming. Maggie is an interesting and unique approach to a subject that is often glossed over in other zombie-related stories, and the quieter moments are the ones that resonate the most.",
         "This is in many ways a good, strange and different film, it is a zombie film, but not in the way you would expect, this is a drama about a dad finding and taking care of his daughter in her last days of an illness. The illness being she is turning into a zombie after she got bit and everything is treated in this film as it is just a terminal disease, there is no cure, there is a time frame, there is some signs to what is happening, but in the end you can't survive it. It is a slow moving drama and really is the storyline and the characters and their interactions that is the film, we are talking a time frame of a week or so and we mainly follow Maggie and her dad and how they try to spend their last days together. We are slowly but steadily introduced to the plague that have been turning people into zombies and how people with the disease are being treated and eventually put away, because there is no cure, if you are bit, there are only three ways of going on, go to the camps where the rest of the zombies are kept, get some kind of shot that will kill you in a excruciating way or take the life of yourself by shooting, breaking your neck or other means. It is a heartfelt movie that you really can't stop watching even though the story moves slowly ahead and it is not like any other zombie movie, it is insightful and interesting and really shows some aspects of life that has nothing to do with becoming a zombie, it could have been about any other terminal illness that can't be cured, but the zombie part is just a great twist to it all. I was entertained and thoughtful after seeing it, it was really something other then I had expected.",
         "'MAGGIE': Four Stars (Out of Five) An indie zombie flick, made on a budget of just $4 million, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Abigail Breslin! It was directed by first time feature filmmaker Henry Hobson and written by first time feature film writer John Scott 3. The movie is actually more of a dramatic character study, than an action or horror film, dealing with the relationship between a teenage girl, in the Midwest, and her loving father. The catch is that the girl is infected with a deadly zombie virus. It's definitely not the type of movie that a lot of Schwarzenegger fans are expecting, but I really liked it. The story is set in a small Midwest town, where a virus, called the necroambulist virus, has broken out. It slowly turns it's victims into zombies and the government deals with the problem by throwing 'the infected' into isolation wards. Maggie (Breslin) is a young teenage girl, who was recently infected by the disease. Her father, Wade (Schwarzenegger), must do his best to care for her, in her last days, and also come to terms with what must be done, when she finally changes. I wasn't sure what exactly to expect, going into this movie. The premise, and idea of Arnold Schwarzenegger starring in a low-budget zombie drama flick, were both very intriguing to me. I am a little disappointed it doesn't have more action, and gruesome thrills, but it is a very well made drama film. Arnold gives, arguably, his best performance to date, and Breslin is pretty impressive as well. I wish there would have been a little more to the story, than just another drama flick about a terminally ill teen, and her relationship with her friends and family. It's almost like a zombie version of 'MY SISTER'S KEEPER' or 'THE FAULT IN OUR STARS', except with a little Schwarzenegger thrown in as well. I think he's making a lot of wise career choices lately, and he's starting to resemble Clint Eastwood, more and more, with each movie. This isn't a great film but it is a nice entry in Arnold's impressively expanding resume. Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/GZMz2QipSqQ",
         "I think one of the reasons this film has a fairly low score is that a lot of people are seeing Arnie/zombies and thinking they are going to be watching a big budget blockbuster with Arnie running around blowing heads off. This, for me, was much better. It was slow moving, thoughtful and Arnie's performance as Wade in it was a revelation to someone who has never been a huge fan. Breslin's depiction of a troubled teen, Maggie, facing her own mortality and horrific end was subtle but effective. A lot of people have been questioning why make it a zombie film and not just any infection but without Maggie's disease making her ultimately dangerous, Wade would not have had to wrestle with his conscience in what he had to do, making the whole film pointless. If you preferred The Road to The Walking Dead then this is the film for you. If you're an Arnie fan expecting the usual fodder then I would suggest skipping this and digging out your Terminator box-set.",
         "Maggie is the film that finally shows an emotional side to zombie films. This movie is not about killing all the infected people in sight. I think that Maggie has a least four excellent performances. The best is definitely Abigail Breslin. It is Arnold Schwarzenegger who is going to bring people to the theatre to see this movie but it really is Breslin's film, she is really the star. Schwarzenegger however is not his normal self. The man can act, and I'm sure that this film will never receive the credit it should because Schwarzenegger is in it and people are too quick to judge it by its cover. Maggie is slow but the performances managed to keep me interested. The film is also dark which perfectly captures its tone. I think that people need to go into this movie with an unbiased mind and it could really be enjoyed.",
         "2015 TRIBECA FILM FESTIVAL: Zombies have been all the craze for quite sometime with shows like \"The Walking Dead\" and films like \"World War Z\" dominating the box office. I've never been such a fan of the genre as something about the undead just hunting on human flesh never seemed appealing. In Henry Hobson's \"Maggie,\" where he recruits Arnold Schwarzenegger and Academy Award nominee Abigail Breslin as a father- daughter pair that spend the final days together before the young Maggie transforms into a zombie is one of the more compelling works on the genre seen yet. Charismatic and truly very moving at times, it's surprising to see where debut screenwriter John Scott 3 brings this compassionate tale. We're introduced to Maggie as her father Wade, just after finds her after a two-week search. She's brought to their farm home where her step-mother Caroline (played by Joely Richardson) and her two younger siblings reside. As Maggie's transformation is sure to become erratic and certain, the entire family sits on the edge as their beloved daughter deals with not only her changing self, but addressing the surroundings of her friends and a future that is now to never be. In his most reserved and accessible performances of his career, Arnold Schwarzenegger proves what happens when you work with some of the most talented people in the business for decades. You're surely to pick up some of their ticks and beats. Internalized as any performance seen by an actor, Schwarzenegger digs deep to show the soul of a broken man, helpless against a virus that is taking away his most precious gift. In addition, he fights for his daughter's right to live out her final days from the local authorities who believe she must go to quarantine, where the infected are put to death. It's a shocking display of emotion from the former governor of California in what will surely be a talking piece of many following a viewing. Oscar-nominee Abigail Breslin truly is a talent. \"Zombieland,\" which many will think of based on themes, kept her at an arm's distance in terms of allowing the environment to reveal itself through her actions. In other zombie films and TV shows, the ongoing theme and narrative is survival. \"Maggie\" takes it in a different direction. You see the deterioration of not just the person's body, but their hopes and dreams. Breslin displays the broken heart of a girl who sees her former boyfriend get taken away despite pleading with his father to stay just one more day. You see the realization of her new self in the behaviors she acquires along the way. And most importantly, and probably the most heartbreaking, is in the final interactions with her friends and in the truth of a future that will never come. Breslin shines like no other. It's happy to see her stretching her acting capabilities at this point in her career. The technical traits of \"Maggie\" are spot on for the most part thanks to director Hobson. In his feature directorial debut, Hobson hones in on the tone of an emotional drama, not a horror film with something extra to offer. I think back to something like M. Night Shymalan's \"The Sixth Sense\" when the thrill factor was secondary to its story and characters. Hobson captures most of those things. Cinematographer Lukas Ettlin paints the canvas beautifully as we've seen in other efforts like \"The Lincoln Lawyer\" and TV's \"Black Sails.\" \"Maggie\" is a moving drama. Echoing the moods of hard-hitting films but with the charisma of any entertaining blockbuster you would see this summer. It's well worth every dollar of an admission ticket and is one of the more enthralling and captivating films of the spring.",
         "First off I just want to say that this is my first review of any film. I attended the world premiere of Maggie last night at the Tribeca Film Festival and I am also a huge Arnold fan. It was great seeing him perform in a different (dramatic) role. The cinematography in this film was absolutely stunning. From the location setting, the small town, old house; it was all well put together. I thought the cast was great and Arnold did a great job in his role but this film was focused on Abigail Breslin. And she stole the show. She outperformed the rest of the cast and made each viewer connected to her character very closely. Abigail had many scenes alone in this film and without giving too much away, there were times you can feel her pain and sort of understand what she was experiencing as the film progressed. Maggie really shed new light to the zombie genre because it showed intimately how a family member was deeply affected by an outbreak. A father and daughter bond filled with love and courage and the chemistry played on screen between Arnold and Abigail was fantastic. Each character showed great passion throughout the film and it was well directed by Henry Hobson, his directorial debut. I recommend this film to viewers who are interested in character development, great cinematography, a well written script, and a solid meaningful ending. Please don't come into this movie expecting The Walking Dead/ Zombieland type of action film because this isn't it. Hopefully Arnold will take on more of these roles in the future and from what we saw in Maggie, Abigail has a great career ahead of her. 9/10",
         "Saw the premiere of this and haven't been able to stop thinking about it. Schwarzenegger is tender and subtle, I saw one review describe his performance as 'gentle', which I bet is not an adjective often used of the man. Abigail Breslin is a sad, scary, horrific lead. Joely Richardson plays a difficult role in a stepmother; a terrified third wheel doing her best with two small kids of her own. Movie is 90 minutes long and destined to be a cult classic. I think my only criticism is that the director's palette looked like an instagram 'old photos' filter; there was enough great acting in this film, and sad suspense leavened with humor, without having to wash it in beige. Overall loved the film, and the studio will regret not putting it in wide release.",
         "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A contagious virus has spread across America that is causing the infected to slowly mutate in to cannibalistic zombies. Wade Vogel's (Arnold Schwarzenegger) daughter Maggie (Abigail Breslin) would be one such person, a young girl grimly aware of her terrible predicament. As the inevitable closes in, father and daughter bond in a final, all encompassing way, before they're drawn towards a terrifying final outcome. After his much hyped comeback a few years ago, Schwarzenegger has achieved what can only at best be called the most hit and miss results with his new batch of explosive, '80s flavoured action films. There was still something resembling an audience, but most people's tastes have cleaned up quite a bit. And so, out of nowhere, it seems, he delivers this latest offering, which on paper comes off just like one of his regular shoot 'em up type films, with him versus zombies. But instead, he's taken such a plot line and given it a more mature angle, as a more tender and heartfelt examination of the final days of a father and daughter, that shows a departure from his usual type of fare. As more emotionally driven as the plot is, it doesn't really have the best sense of structure or direction, and instead seems to be driven more on a moody, lingering sense of atmosphere and tension, with the lighting drained out and brightened up in subsequent shots to affect the mood. Debut feature length director Henry Hobson has shown a certain knack and sense of style behind the camera, but he needs to go back to school a little on his structural narrative abilities, and crafting a film that has somewhere to go in spite of it's heart. So, we have it, then, Arnie's most bizarre film, ever, a totally unexpected and different effort from him that's appeared out the blue. In spite of it's strangeness, it's better than anything he's done lately, and shows a more mature and emotional side developing after so many years. ***",
         "I've heard complaints from a number of people, expressing disdain for Maggie; people keep insisting that it was slow or boring. I don't know what any of them are even talking about. My only suspicion is that they are burdened with a poor attention span. Sure, it is slower than the typical Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick (and I can't deny that I have enjoyed quite a few of those)...and it isn't one of the generic shoot-em-up zombie movies (which I happen to enjoy quite a bit). What people seem to be forgetting is that it wasn't written to be either of those things, and if that was what they expected, the fault is their own...as the movie never makes an attempt to trick the viewer into thinking it might be that sort of movie. The minimalistic score is somber and about as perfect as it could be, the washed out cinematography lends itself well to the desolation of both the world of the movie and the depressing narrative itself, and the acting in all cases is superb...seriously, this is one of Schwarzenegger's most impressive performances, displaying greater depth and humanity than his typical roles allow. Think of this movie as being a beautifully executed amalgam of The Road and The Walking Dead...leaning a little more toward The Road. It is a touching, and intensely sad story of a man desperate to milk the last little bit of fatherhood out of the limited time he has with his dying daughter, and a girl who just wants to live a couple of weeks longer as if things were still OK. There are a couple of tense scenes arising from the nightmarish place the world has become that end up being fairly understated, but they are not the focus of the story, nor are the zombies that people are becoming...those are simply elements of the setting in which the story takes place. In that sense, this movie ends up sharing one of my favorite things about The Walking Dead, that it is ultimately a character study, a detailed focus on human beings and how they are forced to adapt to a situation that no one could ever truly prepare for. Unlike the Walking Dead, Maggie felt like it had a much more even flow to it, it wasn't as unevenly paced, in part because it had no pretense of being action-oriented at any point. It's sincerely quite depressing, but well worth the time spent watching it. I'm sure that plenty of people will disagree with my assessment of this movie, but I really found no fault in it.",
         "A first time director makes a zombie apocalypse movie ? What's the gimmick ? you ask . How about a brooding , introspective film where not a lot happens and is directed in a very obvious independent style . Nothing too radical about that you say but here's the hook - sell it to the public by casting an erstwhile mega-star who despite being ultra popular with cinema goers in the 1980s and early 1990s was never an actor and cast him in a pivotal role that requires him to act . This might be playing with fire or at the very least seems like a cynical attempt to publicise a film in a market it's perhaps not suited for . Let's face it here guys , if you're old enough to remember Arnold Schwarzenegger then there's only one thing you're going to expect and that is over the top violence with weapons that never run out of ammunition and cringe inducing one liners !!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!!! And if you go in to this film expecting any of this you'll probably either fall asleep or stagger out of the cinema in a state of terminal boredom long before the end credits start . MAGGIE was originally going to star Paddy Considine in the role of Wade and director Henry Hobson deserves some credit in getting a fondly remembered big hitter as a casting coup . Again let me emphasise however you're not going to see much in the way of action because this is a character driven film concentrating on mood , long silences and pained facial expression . There's also another clue as to what you're going to be watching and that is the title of the film is MAGGIE and so it revolves around the titular teenage character played by Abigail Breslin finds herself succumbing by a terrifying disease that is sweeping the world . There is some very haunting , understated moments in this film which often feels more like a drama than an out and out horror and it's something of a revelation seeing Arnie in such an unusual role . I don't think he'll be up for Best Supporting Actor at next year's Oscars but it's good see him a film that cost a mere four million dollars which wouldn't get the average Hollywood star out of bed It's not a flawless film of course . Hobson direction doesn't perhaps have the urgency the story perhaps needed more and means MAGGIE isn't as captivating as it should have been with a bit too much in the way of long pregnant silences . He's also a bit too reliant on close ups which becomes a little bit too noticeable very quickly . But despite these flaws for a movie costing four million dollars it's a fairly impressive feature length debut from a first time director",
         "A dismal attempt to make a zombie art film. Not zombie-horror, rather zombie-drama, which, The Walking Dead aside, I'm not really sure could ever work, even with a good script, which Maggie most certainly lacks. This somber downer takes itself way too seriously. There is literally not a single laugh, giggle, or even a smile throughout. To make sure we know that this is a serious art film it's shot in bleak, muted colors and syrupy violins play mournfully on the soundtrack. With its gloomy, bland earnestness, Maggie comes across less like a zombie flick and more like a really bad disease-of-the-week TV movie, a disastrous approach which completely sucks all the fun out of the genre.",
         "I think a lot of folks will like this movie. I think many more won't go out of their way to. This isn't to say it is not a watchable movie as it certainly is. What it requires is a lot of patience as it evolves slower than paint drying. It feels, on purpose, claustrophobic as per the situation the main characters have found themselves in. It's dark and depressing for the most part. This is Arnold Schwarzeneegger like you've rarely, if ever, seen. He is in a dramatic role that, although has a little action, is the polar opposite of his usual shtick. I'd say he is good enough that he maybe ought to move in this direction more since 60+ action heroes have got to be a shrinking market any way you cut it. And, the girl who plays his doomed daughter brings a somber combination of humanity and suffering to a good level indeed. Its the pace and the story that really didn't reel me in. I'm not immature, but I just couldn't invest enough in the story to wade through what felt like visual and mental molasses. I didn't finish it I readily admit as I lost that degree of interest. In fairness I heard an opinion by Dave Schrader on DarknessRadio that he felt it had some kind of good, or interesting, ending. I don't know...and am just not interested in this one enough to revisit it. Everyone is uniquely different and if you long for a very humanized zombie drama devoid of the usual head exploding action, and don't mind something slower than Heinz ketchup, check it out, At least you see Arnold can actually act outside of blowing up stuff and knocking people through walls.",
         "After a long search for his daughter, Maggie, Wade finds her in the quarantine wing of a hospital. Maggie has been infected by an outbreak that transforms the victim into a zombie. Wade's friend Dr. Kaplan assesses, and then discharges Maggie to spend her last days with Wade and her family. Her step-mother Caroline asks Wade to take their other children to her sister's house to keep them safe, while Maggie is slowly transforming. Wade stays by her side, giving her constant reassurance, but Dr. Vern warns him that the moment that he will have to take an ultimate decision is drawing closer and closer....... Who would have thought that, what fundamentally is, a Zombie movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, could turn out to not just one of the years best movies, but also, a serious contender of being in my all time top 25. And thank heavens it was made at this time in his career, and not twenty years ago, as you could well imagine. If it were made in 1995, no doubt it would have been one of the biggest releases of the years, and would have catered for the popcorn friendly, pyrotechnic loving audiences who prefer Michael Bay and one liners to subtlety. This has to be Arnold's finest performance in a movie where he hasn't played a cyborg, and without being disrespectful to the actor, it's because he has very little to say I the film, and relies on facial expressions, and the bond he has with his on screen daughter. His Wade is a world weary person in this, and he looks like he has the world on his shoulders. After all,his daughter is perishing in front of him, causing his nuclear family to fall apart, and all the while, him knowing that he will have to do the most unthinkable act that anyone could possibly do, kill your own offspring. The punishment in his face is almost unbearable at times, and when he is reassuring his daughter, she is ultimately giving him reassurance back, so in turn, their bond is becoming stronger and stronger, the weaker Maggie becomes due to her 'illness'. Having a daughter of a certain age may have made me baits to the film, but there were times when I had great empathy for Wade, especially when Dr. Kaplan gives him advice on certain methods. You ask yourself, would you let her turn, so your not killing your 'daughter', but let her go through a great ordeal of pain and suffering to get there? Or would you do the deed before, knowing full well that your daughter is fully copus mentus when it happens? Schwarzenegger and Breslin have a wonderful chemistry together, you could almost believe that they are father and daughter, every ounce of Maggies pain is shared in Wades eyes, and due to the slow burning nature of the film, it's all the more agonising for the viewer. The first chance you get to see this film, don't hesitate, it's nothing like you would think it would be, and I never thought I'd say this................. ..........but Schwarzenegger is a revelation. Destined for greatness.",
         "Maggie was certainly a zombie movie,but more than that, it was a movie about a young girl facing certain death at the hands of a new virus and how it affects everyone around her. Arnold shines as a father coping with his dying daughter and staying strong in the worst of all situations. Every long shot is like an art piece. Scene changes are like a beautiful album. The movie suffers from some slow moving drags but the long clips are scored beautifully and create a unique style and feel. The grittiness of the shooting does not go unnoticed. Maggie's unkept nails and the shots of Maggie on a swing spliced with Caroline hacking at frozen gross tomatoes are reminiscent of old French horror. A great film, albeit not completely exciting.",
         "I gave this stinker 1 point for the cinematography. There were no other redeeming features or praise deserved in this. This film is the result of a bunch of vapid Hollywood people getting together and deciding 'let's make a meaningful art film about zombies cos kids love zombies and we'll still make a wad of cash'. The result is lose/lose. This is not a meaningful art film or a zombie film. The real issue here is that nothing happens to make you care about any of the characters. You don't care she's dying because you wish they all would. The acting is implausible on all counts. There is no chemistry between the characters, you can't believe any of them are related, and every time some one laughs or cries it's about as believable as a kid's pantomime. Even the setting is ridiculous. Towns in flames and the world destroyed by this disease, and yet somehow hospitals are functioning well enough to be spending so much money and energy on looking after the zombie terminally ill. Kids are hanging out, going to school and hanging with their sick friends, with no fear of catching a flesh decaying virus. If you want a great zombie art film that delves into the human psyche, go watch a Romero film or 28 days later. This is just another trite Hollywood waste of time. I like zombie movies because they deal with human existence and the idea that in the face of extreme circumstances, although a few people will hold onto a moral standard, hell is really other people, not the zombies at all. This movie is just confused in its message. It wants to be a good values Seventh Heaven family drama except nobody is smiling, just wailing over their inner turmoil. Yawn.",
         "Today, zombie has become more than horror, thriller or slasher, it became his own genre. There are many development of it since George A. Romero invented the \"virus\" in Night of the Living Dead at the low/minimalist scale, then he's expanded the universe in many series of the Living Dead at the much more massive scale. It's a lavish idea that can't be bought by money. That's the story of Romero created the future cinema. In Maggie, I found it's a different scale. I can't found a scream, bloody violence or mass panic. It just a father and daughter relationship and love between them. It's an interesting part. We tried to see something hidden behind it mankind doomsday. Henry Hobson direction it's surprisingly gives something special for this genre at his feature debut. We can see, it's dark and depressing in every minutes. Maybe there are no the real horrifying scenes, but with the mood and he's simple quite direction, I think it's done to feel the real situation. Especially in the last minutes, it's so hauntingly beautiful. I liked the way to see Arnie Schwarzenegger without a jump, shoot, and killed many people. I think it's probably strongest performance ever at his phenomenal career. Love to see Abigail Breslin too, first mature character and executed in great way. Overall, I think if we measured at a different scale, it's a great zombie apocalypse piece of work.",
         "This movie is so bad Nick Cage didn't bother signing up for it! The best part of this movie was the ending, as in, it's over and I can now attempt to deal with the two hours I'll never get back. Arnold as a Midwest farmer is as believable as Arnold as a Midwest farmer. Someone thought they could get the big man to show his acting range........fail. This movie is NOT scary for starters. If you're going to see a horror flick this ain't it. It's a bad drama with limited zombies and virtually no action. That being said I know, I know, it wasn't supposed to be an action movie. BUT, one would believe that a film that is about a zombie virus, with zombies, and Arnold would have something more than father and daughter moments. So this is a drama. A pure drama genre movie meant to show the love of a father (Arnold) as he stands by his zombie infected eldest child (Abigail Breslin). It's depressing, slow, and the actors are unbelievable in each of their roles....with the exception of Abigail Breslin. Poor child deserved a better script to work with. So if you're going to watch this be prepared to take a long nap.",
         "If you are looking for action, rent a different Arnold movie. If you are looking for a good zombie apocalypse movie you will not find it here. Arnold gives a great dramatic performance. That is all that can be said about this movie in a positive tone. When was the last time you went to an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie to review the emotional content of his acting? Aside from that the sets in the movie would have you believe that mid-western America is populated by circa 19th century chipping lead painted slat sided houses with poor insulation and quasi plaster walls. At least it was revealed that indoor plumbing was in use. Schwarzenegger is listed in the ending credits as a Producer of this train wreck, which action purposes, a train wreck could have helped it. What is this movie? It is a tale of a loving father and his misunderstood zombie daughter caught in the turmoil of a worldwide apocalypse of unknown origin, and how he must come to grips with the inevitable mass euthanasia that is zombiedom.",
         "First, the positives: I thought visually, the film did a good job of portraying a bleak America gradually succumbing to a zombie outbreak. The make-up was also reasonably well done given the film's small budget. The acting by the two leads was also decent with Schwarzenegger in particular showing a vulnerable side that is usually not present in his movies. Sadly, the film is let down by an extremely weak script and some massive pacing issues. Simply put, nothing happens during the bulk of the movie. The director seems more worried about the mood of the film than actually developing any sort of engaging story. Basically, a father is trying to come to terms with the imminent death of his daughter - it's a story that has been told countless times in other, superior films and this movie doesn't really bring anything new to the table in that regard. If you enjoy movies with a depressing atmosphere you might get something out of this, however anyone looking for an entertaining or engaging film should, in my opinion, look elsewhere.",
         "I'm a huge fan of the zombie genre, I'm a huge fan of Arnold..when I saw the trailer for this I was quite excited, what could be better? It looked like a dark, thought provoking, unique take on outbreak/zombie films. It was also refreshing to see Arnold in a more serious role. The movie started a little slowly, it didn't seem that scary, but I figured it would get better... I kept waiting, and kept waiting, and it didn't get more interesting, it didn't get more scary, it didn't have any real plot or thoughtful story line to speak of.... and then it ended. When the credits started rolling I thought, no way, there has to be more. Awful waste of time, I'm astounded this has any good reviews. Just awful.",
         "When I first heard about this film, it was through Arnold's YouTube channel, as he had done a Reddit premiere for the film. I was intrigued, because the film starred Schwarzenegger in a more serious role, which is something I had never seen from him. It also sounded intriguing because it was a zombie film primarily about a father and daughter, so I expected something with some action but also some heart and such. Did I get that in this film? Let's find out. Maggie follows a girl named Maggie who gets bitten after she runs away from home. Her father manages to pick her up and is told she has approximately six to eight weeks left to live. Her father is now determined to do the best he can to protect Maggie right until the bitter end. Okay, so, let me get this off my chest, I did not like this film as much as I wanted to. That being said, let's start with the positives. The acting was well done. Schwarzenegger, in one of his only serious roles, does a great job portraying the father afraid for his daughter. Breslin also does a great job, portraying the sadness of someone who knows she is going to die. Richardson does a decent job as the step-mother, nothing too amazing, but nothing too bad either. Griffin and Evermore do good as the two cops who constantly enter the film. The look of the film was very bleak and very cold, which I think helped the film in what it was trying to do. Tying into this is the music, which is very ambient at times, but it can also be incredibly poignant when it's trying to be. The set locations of the film I really liked. Keeping it mainly on the house that Maggie and her father share was probably one of the best decisions of the film. I also liked the effects used to slowly progress Maggie into her zombified state - it looked rather cool. Now, let's get to what I didn't like. The story, or rather, the execution. From the simple plot summary I had read on IMDb, I expected a film in which maybe Arnold has to do some things to protect his daughter, or a film in which Arnold and the daughter would have been stuck in the house by themselves, slowly coming to terms with their issues. I got, instead, a film that included 10- minute sequences of different families's lives just to \"make it more poignant when we got to the inevitable ending.\" Which, it didn't. It more annoyed the hell out of me. Devoting 10 minutes of your film in which the title character barely appears, and includes a 3-minute sequence where Arnold's character walks through a house is just ridiculous. It wasn't even to build tension, it was just in there for dramatic purposes. And another thing, I firmly believe that if you're going to make a zombie movie, either don't show zombie killings at all and keep it PG-13, or go all out and make it R. The way this film did it, we always got the \"assumption\" that zombies were killed, which annoyed me to no end. Overall, honestly, Maggie was a decent movie at best. The acting, music, look, set locations and effects used were all nice, but I can't excuse the movie being 95 minutes long and feeling like it's over two and a half hours. When your film is PG-13, and implies anything sort of thrilling in terms of zombie killing, and never shows it, and casts Arnold F'ing Schwarzenegger as your lead star, you have to assume the film would be interesting or good. It started out interesting, but then it devolved into 20 minutes of dialogue in a 90 minute film, which just doesn't work for me. If you really want to see this movie, rent it at Redbox or Netflix, don't pay more than $2 for it. You'll thank me later. 4/10. Grade: C-",
         "This movie should have been a 15 minute short story. I'm so upset I sat through it wasting an hour and a half of my life. Arnold did an okay job in his role, and I love Abigail and her acting abilities. However this was a waste of their talent. The trailer (like in most cases) showed this movie to be suspenseful, maybe a few \"jump\" moments, etc... Alas, none of that. Just long, drawn out, and frustrating. The ending was far less than thrilling, and should have occurred 15 minutes after starting. If you're expecting a good thriller, or a \"Walking Dead\" movie scenario you're sure to be disappointed. I'm unsure as to how this movie has even 3 stars, it was so dull. The potential was there, but it fell short. I will say the makeup was decent. That's about it, the story itself was a total bust.",
         "\"Dad, you've protected me all my life. Now it's my turn to protect you. There is life with you, not with me.\" When you hear Arnold Schwarzenegger is starring in a zombie film you're probably expecting a full blown action movie similar to World War Z, but Maggie is the complete opposite. It's a slow burning drama where zombies slowly convert after being bitten. Schwarzenegger plays a father who is trying to protect his teenage daughter, Maggie (Abigail Breslin), who has been infected with the virus. The film begins with him driving to a hospital where Maggie is being held in quarantine. They allow Wade to take his daughter home so he can spend the last few days with her, but he must promise to bring her back when the virus begins to take full control of her. When they arrive back home her stepmother (Joely Richardson) is waiting for them so Maggie can say goodbye to her siblings before she takes them to her sister's house to keep them safe. The film basically moves at a very slow pace and it uses this innovative concept as the driving force of the narrative. It tries to introduce a world where the victims are still considered as people and not simply lifeless zombies where no one would hesitate to pull the trigger. It may be a fresh twist on the crowded and familiar zombie genre, but I felt it was simply a dull and boring experience that never brought anything interesting to the story other than introducing the unique premise. The cinematography is bleak and dark, but perhaps it's what works best in this lifeless film. We've seen different approaches taken when it comes to the zombie genre, beginning with the familiar horror genre (Night of the Living Dead), and then explored in action movies (World War Z), comedies (Zombieland), and even in romantic comedies (Warm Bodies), but I don't think the subject had been approached in the past as a drama where you actually see the toll it takes on the victim and their family. That is where Maggie stands out from the rest of the films in the genre, but unfortunately it doesn't work because you never feel engaged with these characters. The narrative puts its emphasis on the concept, but leaves out any character development. We get some glimpses of Maggie's life in a couple of scenes where she goes out with her friends and spends time with her father, but there isn't much more than that so Maggie doesn't even work as a character study. It is simply a dull film that tries too hard to be a metaphor about a young girl facing a deadly disease. The performances in this film have been praised by several critics, but I didn't find any of them groundbreaking. Breslin is a talented young actress and she delivers a solid role, but her character isn't given much to work with. Schwarzenegger is attempting something different, and perhaps that is why he is receiving some recognition for his work, but his range continues to be limited and I much prefer him in roles like The Last Stand where he is exploiting and having fun with the action hero stereotypes that made him such a famous star in the first place. Perhaps it was the overall pacing of the film that put me to sleep, but I just never was invested with any of these characters to enjoy the performances. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",
         "A full waste of my time. This is not a zombie movie nor a Schwarzenegger kind of movies. Don't expect any action what so ever. This is a sad and poor way to tell a father daughter story. I waited for the punch line but nothing happens in this movie rather then the expected and the obvious. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Sorry Arnold, I really love your other movies.. but this is total BS. I am supposed to write 10 lines on this awful movie and I am doing this just to warn you all from seen it. 10 lines? it is just another waste of my time.. I really wish I hadn't seen this movie. DO NOT GO TO SEE IT OR RENT IT."
