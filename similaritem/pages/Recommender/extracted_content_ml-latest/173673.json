         "A little girl is lost in Moscow and hits the road making fun (not intentionally) of everybody she meets. She'll be back home soon but she will change the life of at least one man forever. The movie has good music and an unforgettable mixture of annoying (a busy-body), ridiculous (a desperate couple), and sad (a lonely man) characters. This film is to be on the IMDb top 250 list because it is humane, moral, and simple while being witty, dramatic, and excitingly funny (a treat for children/adults and a lesson for the grown-ups/kids). What is more, it has an extremely high \"re-watch\" potential. Let me point out the following. This movie is crafted on the same level as \"City Lights\". Coolness of some movies that are rated extremely high on IMDb may fade away with years, but humanity of stuff like this will stay. If you have any doubts, learn the Russian language, find this movie, and watch it. Or watch the version with subs. To me it unquestionably deserves the highest mark. Thanks for attention.",
         "Since I don't speak much Russian, I am giving this a no rating (5). This movie is a propaganda movie made in 1939, not 1948. It is set in Moscow pretty close to the center of the city. It is a nice look at what things looked like in the late 30s. Although, it was a propaganda film. There was no visible poverty. It was an ideal world of children playing and parents who spent their time fussing over their children. The latest modern improvements were showcased - cars, trams, toilets, sinks, and showers. Although, there was a funny scene where the father in the movie has trouble getting the shower head to stop spraying water all over the bathroom. The plot was simple. A little girl's cat runs away. She chases after it, while her parents are arguing. She ends up in the busy streets of Moscow. An elderly couple befriends her, and wants to take her in as their child. In the end, the police officers/soldiers find the girl. It was due to the citizens, many of them children, that she is found. I heard that Moscow traffic is much worse today than during the Soviet Union. If that is so, it must be really bad. This film should be watched, because it shows what Moscow looked like right before getting into the war with Germany."
