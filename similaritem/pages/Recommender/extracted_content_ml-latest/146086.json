SACHIN (original name), is from a rich family among his friends. he has a bungalow in ALIBAUG, which he is thinking to sell to start a business from those money, as he had lost his job in America due to recession. But on coming to his bungalow, these friends met four girls,staying there,and each of them fell in love to one of them resp. One of these girl was cousin of the man, who was looking after the bungalow in absence of his owner. So, due to love and affection for his girl, SACHIN changes his mood and decision to sell the bungalow and decided to expand the mess going on there into a hotel with partnership with that man. and thus the movie ends with a happy ending. its a romantic, comedy drama."],

         "Respite that is needed to ponder over your relationships, respite to talk to their Near and dear ones, respite to hear the problems of their family and relatives, Respite to share their problems with their friends and well wishers. KSHANBHAR VISHRANTI is the story of four young couples sharing a strong band of friendship, a story about their dreams and aspirations, a story about the blossoming love between them. These four young couples are the representatives of today's youth, who are hard working and will not leave any stone unturned in order to achieve their goals. Always ready to prove their mettle and with their ability to understand and support each other they manage to create a platform that helps them move ahead in life. A thought provoking film with a philosophy of its own, this is a sheer poetry on celluloid.",
