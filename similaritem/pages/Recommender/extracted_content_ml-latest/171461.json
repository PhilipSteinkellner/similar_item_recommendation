      "synopsis": "A tributary of the upper Amazon. A small boat moves up river, it is late in the afternoon and the boat anchors as Captain Lucas (Nestor Paiva) announces they will push through to the Black Lagoon in the morning. Two passengers, George Johnson (Robert Williams) and Joe Hayes (John Bromfield) debate the value of the expedition. Joe is determined to capture the creature and take it back to the Aquarium to exhibit it for the world to see. Lucas warns that if it is dead they have wasted their money and if still alive, they probably will wish it was dead After dinner the discussion continues. Lucas cant understand the point of what they are doing. The creature should be left alone, not captured for the whim of science. Lucas explains he came to the lagoon the previous year with an expedition, and 5 people eventually were killed during that trip They go on to discuss the origins of the creature. Johnson explains that under the right conditions a creature might avoid being affected by evolution, leap forging many important steps. Lucas argues the creature is too strong for evolution and if the two passengers think they can just capture the thing, they will be sadly mistaken Next morning the boat enters the lagoon without incident. Unseen, the creature surfaces and studies their activities then swims off. Joe dons a diving suit and goes into the water to secure a net they have hung across the entrance of the lagoon The creature sees Joe and stalks him, waiting for a chance to attack. Preoccupied with the net Joe doesnt see the creature till it is too late. The men on the boat hear Joes frantic cries for help and begin pulling him in with the life line. The creature tries to break the line before being driven off by gunfire from the boat The next day Johnson sets a series of explosives around the lagoon, detonating them should stun the creature and force it to the surface. The plan works and the creature floats unconscious near the boat. The men secure the creature and begin the task of transporting it back to Florida after notifying the press At the institute in Florida Doctor Ferguson (John Agar) is studying predatory behavior in mammals when news comes through of the capture of the creature. He is encouraged to go to Ocean Harbor to study the creature At Ocean Harbor the creature is unloaded from the boat and transferred to a holding tank so studies can begin. Concerns are raised over the fact the creature has remained in a coma since being stunned by the explosions. The publicity generated by the creature is enormous; hotels are book for 50 miles around by tourists wanting to see the creature Overseeing the transfer is Helen Dobson (Lori Nelson) shes decided to use the creature as the basis of a thesis. She explains to reporters why Joe is walking the creature around the holding tank. The technique is the same used on sharks to push water through the creatures gills and revive it. Two hours later the creature stirs. Tension mounts as Joe barely makes it out the tank before being attacked. The creature goes on a rampage and tries to jump out of the tank. Joe stops the creature but falls back into the tank. Two workers attempt to rescue him but are badly hurt before a net is thrown over the creature and it is bought back under control Sometime later the creature is introduced to the main viewing tank so the public can see it. One leg is secured with a chain to stop the animals further attempts to escape A few days later the aquarium has settle into a routine, visiting crowds are huge and the process of studying the creature begins. Ferguson and Helen meet and discuss their mutual fields of research and how it will affect the research being done. At the same time there is a clear emotional connection beginning to form between the couple. As their conversation becomes more relaxed Ferguson asks Helen out to dinner. The discussion is interrupted by Joe Hays, also interested in Helen. She rebukes Joes advances and ultimately makes plans with Ferguson. Time progresses and Ferguson and Dobson continue their experiments. They try training the creature using vocal commands similar to methods used on dolphins. Entering the tank, they are armed with a special shock probe; by zapping the creature at the right time during feeding they believe they can teach the animal to be less aggressive. They then lower another portion of food that has been injected with drugs to make the creature go to sleep. Satisfied its pacified Ferguson attaches a device for measuring the creatures brain activity as well as drawing blood samples The blood tests throw up some odd results, Ferguson begins to worry about exactly what they are dealing with. On every level tested the creature appears on an evolutionary scale closer to man than animals. Helen also expresses concern for the creature. She perceives it is lonely and worries what long term effects all the testing might have on it The conditioning training continues and Ferguson is stunned by the creatures progress. What a chimp learns in three weeks the creature learns in a matter of hours. During one experiment the creature reacts by attacking and injuring Ferguson. Dobson pleads with the creature to stop, which it eventually does However it has its blood lust up, and begins furiously attacking the chain holding it till a link breaks. Joe spots what the creature is up too and attempts to intervene. He is dragged into the tank and killed Leaving the tank the creature sends park visitors scattering. Its behavior is unusual, although having the opportunity to kill a number of visitors it ignores them, preferring to concentrate on getting back to the nearby ocean A week later reports are come from as far as Mexico and New York about possible sightings, however the authorities are convinced it is probably moving back to the habitat it knows best, the Amazon river. That same night, Dobson readies for a shower in her hotel room. Unknown to her the creature has come ashore and is prowling around the building. Her dog attacks the creature as it enters her room. The noise disturbs Ferguson in the next room. He investigates only to Helen in the shower and her dog missing. Going out and checking the grounds he finds nothing. He assumes the dog has gone after a rabbit and should be back safe and well in the morning. Unseen in the bushes are the remains of Dobsons dog, recently killed by the creature. The next morning Dobson and Ferguson take a boat trip up river. There plan is to have lunch in Jacksonville as a farewell date. The creature knows she is onboard and begins following the craft till it breaks down. As the crew try to fix the fault Helen and Ferguson go for a swim The creature follows Helen as she swims, but seems tentative about attacking other than briefly touching her leg. Before the aggression can become more marked, it is announced the boat is fixed and will soon be on its way. The date then continues as planned. Taking a break from dancing, they go for a walk along the pier. Talk turns to the struggles the upcoming three month of separation will have on their relationship. As true scientist the subject turns to what love really is as they wander back to the dance arm in arm. The creature climbs the pier and follows them back to the dance. Bursting into the room, it roars scattering the crowd then snatches Helen. Ferguson follows the creature to the waters edge then dives in frantically searching for her A couple fishing in a boat nearby hear screaming coming from a channel marker in the river. Helen has broken free of the creature and is trying to escape by climbing onto the structure. As they watch she is dragged back under and despite the arrival of a police launch, is not seen again. The police have issued an alert and begin clearing the public off the streets. Two young men driving find a body on a nearby beach. The stop to investigate and realizes it is Helen and she is still alive. The creature sneaks up on the two preoccupied men and kills them before once again heading into the water with Helen in tow. The search intensifies around Point Diego after police find the dead mens bodies. Hundreds of armed police begin scouring the area. Ferguson briefs the police on what to expect. He stresses the sheer strength of the creature and its apparent high level of intelligence The creature has come back ashore, however having spent extended periods out of the water it begins to weaken. Once again abandoning Helen on a deserted beach it returns to the water to regain its strength. Searchers arrive and see Helen as the creature re-emerge from the water, hearing the reported sighting police converging on the scene. The creature retrieves Helen and heads for the water as Ferguson arrives, using the conditioning training taught at the aquarium he makes the creature drop Helen. The police seize the opportunity and open fire with a volley of gun fire Helen and Ferguson embrace as we see a final shot of the creature drifting lifeless towards the ocean floor Chapman_glen@yahoo.com",

         "In all fairness this movie should be judged for what it is .... a 1950's B Monster movie flick. I give it high marks in this area. It may not have the shock and scare value as it predecessor \"The Creature of the Black Lagoon\" but I find it to be a good representative of it's genre. A lot of this film was shot at Marineland in Florida at a time before there ever was a Sea World. As a kid I was amazed at some of the scenes in the film such as \"The Creature\" over turning a car as he was escaping the Aqua Park, and jumping out of a huge aquatic tank to attack the audience. Recently I talked with Ricou Browning (who played \"The Creature\") and determined that Universal Studios used wires to turn over the car that was supposedly thrown by the Creature. Wires were once again used to pull the Creature out of the large tank at Marineland as the Creature attacked actor, John Bromfeld. Seconds later he was attacking the Marineland crowd. As a young theater goer I found this fascinating. This film has been taking a lot of heat from some of your web site critics. I think it is well worth watching to see how the old Hollywood crowd use to scare us at the Drive-In. If nothing else it serves as a pleasant stroll down \"memory lane\".",
         "No doubt designed to make a fast buck in the 50s, you still get the Gill Man, one of the coolest of all monster designs ever, and a woman to throw cars for and swim thousands of miles for in beautiful Lori Nelson. Even in a production without much life, the Gill Man still seems powerful and mysterious, and his biological drive to mate with Ms. Nelson is interesting considering the long lineage of sympathetic monsters in love with knock-out blondes and brunettes. Sadly, the idea of the monster, the tragic beast longing for what is impossible to him (Wolf Man, King Kong, the Mummy) is a distant memory in filmdom. There was the recent DARK MAN, and Nicholson's WOLF, but these are obvious throw-backs to a time when monsters were more than scurrying guerrillas attacking from the shadows or machine-like mass murderers who cannot be killed. I won't count fluffy-haired vampires, whose allure as suave parasites is not \"monstrous\". A monster, in classic terms, in love with a beautiful woman, is denied her by the facts of their existence. Either because of grotesqueness or species-differences, the monster endures pain, capture, and often death in his attempt to carry a Lori Nelson in his arms through a moonlit swamp. In REVENGE the Gill Man is probed, prodded, and stared at by tourists, definitely the worst fate, though this allows the Creature to establish a magnetic attraction to Lori Nelson. You get a great escape, more Lori Nelson in bathing suits, a big bohunk who has an unhealthy fetish with wrestling the Gill Man hand-to-hand, and lots more Lori Nelson in a bathing suit. What you don't do is watch this movie for any reason but to see the Gill Man thrash in the water and smack bohunks...and if you're a fan of the Creature and classic monsters, you'll understand the tragic consequences when you're a walking fish-man who's half-man enough to love a human woman, and whose tears probably would never show, in the depths of the deepest lagoons.",
         "**SPOILERS** Fairly good sequel of \"Creature From the Black Lagoon\" has the Rita II traveling back to the Amazon Basin to capture the Gill Man who survived in the earlier film from his would-be-captors or executioners. Getting the Gill Man trapped in the Black Lagoon the boat's crew headed by aquatic scientist Joe Hayes, John Bromfield, blast the Gill Man out of the water with high explosives. Knocked out and helpless the Gill man is shipped back to the USA to Ocean Harbor Aquarium in Silver Springs Florida to be exhibited to the eager and curious public and examined by scores of scientists and ichthyologists. To see just what he's all about and if he's the missing link between man, before he evolved into a primate, and fish. Put in this huge water tank and held down by a steel chain tied to his leg the Gill Man is a major curiosity piece for the thousands of tourists who visit the aquarium. Much like in the first Gill Man film the underwater photography is breathtaking with the Gill Man trapped, swimming around in circles, and having nowhere to go. As well as when he's free in the open ocean and in the Amazon River swimming and diving like he were an Olympic Gold Medal winner. Examined by Prof. Clete Ferguson, John Agar, and ichthyologist Helen Dobson, Lori Nelson,the Gill Man develops a crush on Helen and that drives him almost bonkers as he's just out of reach of grabbing Helen when she and Clete are studying him underwater. It doesn't take long for the Gill Man to break his chain and escape from the tank. After tearing up the aquarium, and killing a couple of people, he jumps into the Atlantic Ocean and swims away. The Gill Man for some reason doesn't travel south to the Amazon River where he comes from but north to the St. Augustine/Jacksonville area in Florida to follow Helen who's there with Prof. Ferguson and her dog Chris. Obviously madly in love with Helen but too shy to ask her out on a date the Gill Man spends the last half of the movie stalking her all the way up Florida's Atlantic Coast. He finally gets enough nerve to approach Helen and burst into the local Lobster House, during a Saturday night bandstand party, knocking the place, with it's tables chairs and people, over and putting a couple of drunk party goers into the hospital. Grabbing a terrified Helen the Gill Man disappeared with her into he night. The ending was what you would have expected with the Gill Man stymied in his attempt to swim back home, to the Black Lagoon, with Helen and shot up by Prof. Furguson and an army of police and local townspeople but still making a successful getaway. Even though the villain in the movie the Gill Man evoked far more sympathy in \"The Revenge of the Creature\" then he did in \"the Creature from the Black Lagoon\". Since he had more screen time and showed genuine sensitivity and feeling for Helen. He was also minding his own business in the safety of the Black Lagoon, when he was kid or creature-napped by a bunch of strangers, the crew of the Rita II. Who's only reasons for doing it was to glorify and enrich themselves at his, the Gill Mans, expense and freedom.",
         "MORD39 RATING: ** out of **** This first sequel to CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON is pretty standard stuff, although I've always preferred the look of the monster in this film even over the original. He appears darker and somehow that strikes me as better. Other than that, it's pretty much run-of-the-mill as the Creature is captured and then escapes from a Marineland attraction. I suppose that the idea of the Creature becoming a major attraction as a sideshow exhibit is interesting, but it becomes tedious at times as we watch John Agar and Lori Nelson try to train and feed him in his new environment. Lori Nelson has some pretty dumb dialogue at times, too. This film is not beyond enjoyment, though. When you consider that JAWS 3D (also from Universal) copied the idea of this film with disastrous results, REVENGE OF THE CREATURE looks pretty decent indeed.",
         "More like revenge of the director. Maybe it's the smug aura of John 'what is it I don't know' Agar, but this one seemed less like a horror flick and more like an inaugural presentation for Sea World. Wouldn't that have been a a great match up: Gill Man vs Shamu! This orca ain't no alligator you can snap in half. Helen Dobson is a nice distraction from the relenting slow pace quite apparent in the film. Her expertise in ichthyology is most impressive especially in that white swimwear. Can you really blame the Gill Man for trying? Give this movie credit for the creature's special effects. Keeping in mind this was made in 1955, the articulate detail for Gilly adds this other worldy effect and it's so bizarre seeing any scene where his gills flap in and out. Poor GM, he was just misunderstood. How would you react to repeated cattle prodding?",
         "There are many moments to savor in this thrilling, intriguing follow-up to \"Creature From the Black Lagoon.\" The lovely heroine (Lori Nelson) stares at the captured creature through the glass of the aquarium, two strangers in a man's world. She talks about her career while her peers have already married and had children while also feeling sorry for the creature, a lonely alien in civilization. Taking a swim in the Florida Everglades, (echoing the famed Julie Adams-Creature pas de deux in the original), the now-escaped \"gill-man\" watches from below, but she is joined by her lover (John Agar), who kisses her mid-scene. Later, she takes a shower in a motel, with the creature outside, in a chilling pre-\"Psycho\" sequence. Some of the dialogue is dated and stilted, and the creature costume this time looks worse for the wear - apparently goggles were inserted into the mask to make it easier for Rico Browning's underwater swimming. But great, eerie night-time photography at the end and just plain thrilling scenes make this a winning sequel.",
         "The Creature from the Black Lagoon is back! This time he's captured by scientists and transported to an aquarium in south Florida... Jack Arnold returns as director, and he has brought Ricou Browning back as the creature. 1950s science fiction lead John Agar is also here, making this a pretty solid sequel. (And who can be opposed to a film with Clint Eastwood in it?) I guess a lot of people harp on this film. Mike Mayo calls it \"insipid\" and \"a joke.\" Howard Maxford calls it \"run-down\". Well, I like it better than the original. I really, truly do. I feel more happens and the plot is more developed. I would have to watch both again to make a definitive statement, but I watched them both back to back and was bored by the first compared to the second.",
         "Director Jack Arnold and company took great care in this one to make the 3-D effects look more natural. While there are no chairs or spears thrown at the camera, there are still plenty of thrilling moments when the creature advances into view and even a couple of false frights, as when a threatening shadow turns out to be no more dangerous than Lori Nelson's hand. Admittedly the screenplay has its weak links. Depending largely on unlikely co-incidences, the storyline pays scant regard to consistency or logic, while the dialogue is not only trite and banal but seems to go out of its way to provide a persistent assault on the viewer's intelligence by explaining what we can actually see for ourselves. No-one can walk to the bathroom in this film without someone providing a running commentary. Worse, the characters prove little more than pasteboard figures which indifferent actors like Agar and Nelson struggle to bring to life. Miss Nelson is further handicapped by the large amount of make-up she was forced to wear for the 3-D cameras. True, the effect seemed not only attractive but perfectly natural when the original film was projected through a 3-D filter and then viewed through polaroid glasses. She still looks great when framed through a Marineland window, but in bright sunlight the effect now looks ridiculous. Of course, the Creature himself seems far less menacing (and far more obviously a stuntman in an ill-fitting rubber suit) when exposed to the glare of flat, over-bright 2-D scrutiny. Nonetheless, the skill of Jack Arnold's direction, particularly in his efforts to disguise obvious 3-D tricks and use depth to produce shock in a seemingly more realistic way, gives the movie sufficient interest and vigor to overcome all script and histrionic short-comings. Production values benefit from location filming and it's good to see Scotty Welbourne handling all the photographic chores on this one, both underwater and main unit. Of course, in 2-D the picture looks over-lit as it was lensed with 3-D's 20% light reduction firmly in mind.",
         "Okay, this sequel is miles away from having the taut tension, creepy atmosphere, wonderful character acting, and decent script the original The Creature From the Black Lagoon had. No argument here. But, this film does have its moments, and at the very least is an adequate sequel. It has little of the suspense of the first film, especially in the first 45 minutes where very little of note occurs. Two fellows and the wonderful Nestor Paivia are back on the Rita in search of the missing link creature. They capture him, and the creature is transported to a Sea World type of place for housing, experimentation, and to be gawked at. The creature shows the scientists there, the male lead is John Agar with his hokey yet enjoyable acting style and the female is Lori Nelson who can at the very least fill out a swimsuit very nicely, that he can think and is very closely related to man. Eventually he escapes and falls in love with the beautiful Nelson and abducts her and moves along the waterways....leaving her on the land while he gets back in the water. It's a romance that will bring tears to your eyes. The script is probably the weakest link in the film as we are asked to believe that the creature knows where and when Nelson will be when he crashes a party at a bar and steals her away...literally! The acting is pretty standard here. No one in particular stands out except good old Nestor. Clint Eastwood has a brief and silly cameo in the beginning of the film. What about the creature? He is impressive. The underwater shots are handled nicely by director Jack Arnold. The film also says something about man's nature to toy with nature for his own pleasure...whether that pleasure takes the form of clinical scientific research or in just spending a day at an aquarium staring at some kind of natural freak.",
         "After the success of \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\", Universal Studios figured audiences would want to take another dip with the Gill Man and they were right. This time, marine biologist Bromfield hires the same boat captain that took the first set of scientists to the lagoon and sets out to capture the creature. After bombing the place (and killing all the fish....apparently ecology was but a thing of the future!), he captures the comatose creature and ships him to Florida to be an attraction and an experiment at an aqua park. He is joined by researcher Agar and student Nelson (looking and sounding far more mature than her 22 years!) who attempt to train the creature to respond to human commands. When the Gill Man has had enough of being chained to the floor of a huge aquarium and being prodded and tormented by his captors, he breaks loose, nabs Nelson and leads the police on a massive chase along the Florida coastline. This second entry (with one more sequel to come) doesn't have the same creepy atmosphere of the original, but it more than makes up for it in campy, unintentionally humorous ways. Agar gives a very routine performance, smiling idiotically at various points, then reverting to stoicism. Nelson runs hot and cold, too. In her first scene, when she witnesses a man being attacked by the creature, her expression is along the same lines as discovering that her soufflé fell while she was gabbing on the phone. She improves as it goes along, but is given some goofy things to say and do. She is hardly a match for the divine Julie Adams in the original, though her dress at the end is lovely and she gets to do what had to be a partial inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's shower scene in \"Psycho\". Bromfield, not long after having frolicked with Esther Williams in \"Easy to Love\", has a more difficult swimming partner this time as he continuously wrangles the Gill Man. His tan, beefy looks fill out his teeny swim trunks beautifully, though his role eventually becomes a bit of a throwaway. (Fortunately, the baggy shorts the men wore in the first movie have been replaced by dinky, tight speedo-like ones here.) Future stars Eastwood and Halsey appear in bit parts. Eastwood has the most lamentable role as a sort of backward lab technician who can't keep track of the four mice he's been placed in charge of. Halsey has it better as a college student who has a run-in with the creature. The film is chock full of dry, now-hilarious moments of drama and bizarre plot details that make little or no sense. Nelson befriends a dog that roams into the aqua park and then has it living in her hotel room? The creature can track Nelson on land from the ocean? A police dispatcher feels it necessary to announce that she's a \"pretty\" student when detailing her kidnapping. When the monster goes on his rampage, a woman blithely lets go of her daughter who then falls at the feet of the creature. Miraculously, though he has mauled and killed men beforehand, he lets the mother kneel down and protect the child. In this film, more than in the original, audience sympathy leans towards the creature. After all, he was dragged form his home and then placed on display. The \"training\" sequences are remarkably cruel. Nelson places a box of food near him and as he reaches for it, Agar stabs him with a bull prod! Nice! Then she does the same thing with a ball. She entices him to play with it and then here comes the prod again! (Incidentally, the whole prod issue seems unlikely to work the way it is shown.) It does, however, turn a bit funny when the Gill Man retreats and sits on a rusty anchor. As in the original, there's an underwater swimming sequence, this time with Agar and Nelson canoodling while the creature lurks. Gill Man could have easily snatched her and gone off, but then there'd be no film. Even amongst all the goofiness, a modicum of suspense makes its way into the movie. Again, the monster gets some surprising mobility and speed underwater and is pretty threatening. This film draws from past classics (\"King Kong\"), yet inspired future movies as well (\"Jaws 3-D\", \"Orca\".) Far from a true classic, it entertains in spite of itself.",
         "If you've seen the original, this one is a little tough to sit through. The acting is up to its abyssal par and Lori Nelson is attractive but the thing takes place in Marineland, Florida. Far from being exotic, as \"The Creature From the Black Lagoon\" was, we have a tourist trap within a state that is itself one big tourist trap. The harmless dialog sometimes sound aimed at a demographic exemplified more by the Gill Man than by his human captors. Reporter to Lori Nelson: \"Can you tell us why you're here?\" Nelson: \"I'm an ichthyologist.\" Reporter: \"An ichthyologist! Wow! That's a ten-dollar word. Can you tell us what it means?\" Nelson: \"I study fish.\" There's little mystery to it. It opens with the same boat and the same skipper taking a trip up the same \"tributary of the Amazon River\" but that sequence is over with in a jiffy when the gill man is comatized by some dynamite and transported forthwith to his tank in the states. This is rather like the second half of \"King Kong\". The creature gets loose, offs a few people, and returns to the sea, only to be drawn back to land by his fascination with Lori Nelson. Well, we can't blame the creature. I saw this as a kid and was astonished when Lori Nelson dropped her bathrobe and slithered around in her skivvies preparatory to taking a shower. It didn't matter than her underwear looked like G.I. issue. This is some Gill Man, by the way. He's escaped and is now in the ocean, right? But he swims up the St. Johns River and knows that Lori Nelson has gotten on a boat with John Agar. As the boat travels upriver, the Gill Man follows it. When Agar and Nelson stop at a motel, the Gill Man even knows which room to go to. And later, he even knows that Nelson is DANCING with Agar at a nightclub called The Lobster Pot, from which he kidnaps her. You ought to see the atmosphere people at that Lobster Pot dance. They were locals, hired from an establishment next to the restaurant, and not one of them is smiling or having a good time, just stiffly shuffling about to Henry Mancini's music. I did a far better job as an extra, dancing at an embassy party in \"Windmills of the Gods,\" a cheap miniseries that puts this so-called \"feature film\" to shame. \"Windmills of the Gods\" is a splendid example of what a film SHOULD look like. The acting of the extras, in particular, is eyeball-coagulatingly good. And if you want to see truly exuberant dancing extras, watch my bro and his wife on the dance floor in \"Timepiece.\" I got lost for a moment. Where was I? Did I get through Lori Nelson's skivvies? Yes, I see I did. Okay -- I also wanted to mention that the scenes of the creature being subject to Pavolovian conditioning underwater is impossible. Electricity is nothing more than a bunch of loose electrons jumping from atom to atom and they're especially attracted to water, so you can not shock a monster under water. I should mention the film's good points too, I suppose, in pursuit of a balanced assessment so the reader can make an independent judgment. Let's see. I pointed out Lori Nelson's undies, didn't I. Well then there is the scene of two teen-aged boys driving in a convertible and arguing about whether college is worth the effort or not. The driver argues that high school is good enough for him. The other points out that nowadays a college education is getting to be what a high school education used to be. He may think he's being wise but I happen to have more degrees than a thermometer and I'm sorry I didn't quit high school and go into the cement business. I'd be living like a Pasha today instead of in this hovel. In sum: Not really a bad movie, and entertaining in its own unchallenging way. It also includes a few shots of Lori Nelson in her underwear. I may have pointed that out elsewhere. What it lacks, it lacks mostly in comparison to its predecessor which was a neatly tied-up story suggestive of the bizarre as well as the exotic.",
         "The Creature was the last of the classic Universal monsters I got into, which only happened in 2001 via the original DVD release of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON (1954). I loved the film immediately, however, and was very much interested in watching its two sequels - REVENGE OF THE CREATURE and THE CREATURE WALKS AMONG US (1956). Now that I've caught up with both of them, I'd say that Universal did well enough by this particular monster, and that having arrived so long after the Studio's other notables (Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, The Invisible Man and The Wolf Man) proved fortuitous, because The Creature wasn't allowed to become redundant in his own 'starring vehicles' as was the case certainly - and sadly - with both The Frankenstein Monster and The Mummy. As for the film itself, it isn't up to the original (with which I should be re-acquainting myself over the week-end) - despite having the same director. The change in setting is interesting, and it works most of the time; the main problem, I guess, lies with The Creature's alarmingly limited characteristics: it can only either swim (in the water) or go on a rampage (on land) - although, to be fair, The Mummy is perhaps even duller! Still, the film offers reasonable entertainment and the leads are O.K. if, again, failing to match those of the original.",
         "Well, I've seen worse, lots worse. In its favor, the movie still features one of the coolest (and best implemented) monster designs ever to emerge from the old B&W films of that era, and the underwater photography is still quite arresting - apparently the actor in the creature costume was capable of holding his breath underwater for incredible amounts of time, and so the creature looks entirely at home and natural in the water. Against it? A weak screen play where nothing interesting happens for almost 30 minutes in two different parts of the movie. Some of the worst movie dialog actors have ever been forced to utter (I can just imagine how John \"I worked with John Wayne once\" Agar must have died inside while trying to deliver some of his bon-mots.) A distinct lack of chemistry between Agar and Lori Nelson and a screen play that does nothing to give them anything to draw them together (except for the old \"you are so \"the only person around\" problem). Worse, the creature himself seems over-exposed here. Since the movie yanks him out of his creepy, isolated, backwater lagoon in the first 15 minutes, he loses the mystery and most of his menace from his original surroundings once he is moved to his bright, shiny Sea World. After that, he's just a good costume and a set of talons. The guy who wrote \"Keep Watching The Skies\" remarked about \"Revenge Of the Creature\" that the only good things about this sequel are the elements they kept from the first one. I'd have to agree that this is about right - everything the film makers tried to add and expand on in the sequel just didn't really click. Still, as a little kid, this would have been great fun.",
         "\"Revenge Of The Creature\" is at best a sequel that pales in comparison to the original, and pretty well done, \"Creature From The Black Lagoon.\" A lot of what made the original movie work is missing here. The performances aren't as good, Lori Nelson (while attractive) isn't as head turning beautiful as Julie Adams was in the original, and, being set mostly (except for the first few minutes) in Florida rather than the Amazon, the sequel lacks some of the mystery of the original. In \"Revenge,\" the gill-man is captured by scientists and brought to some sort of public aquarium to be studied and to serve as a big attraction for the tourists. Admittedly, one thing this movie had that I didn't find in the original was a bit of sympathy for the creature. You can't help but feel a bit sorry for him chained in the tank and jolted with cattle prods on a regular basis as the tourists gawk at him. The creature is much more the focus of this movie, and the violence he commits is shown much more graphically (although all within the acceptable tastes of 1955, of course.) Where the creature isn't the focus, the movie weakens dramatically. The romance between Clete and Helen was a sort of \"ho-hum, who really cares\" experience, and why in the world we needed to be introduced to so many cutesy animals doing tricks (the porpoise, the chimpanzee) was beyond me. One thing I couldn't figure out was - even given his obsession with her - how the creature kept managing to find Helen in a variety of places. Admittedly, the creature is a fun monster to watch; the movie unfortunately is less so. 5/10",
         "Scientests capture the gill man and bring him to Florida as a tourist attraction, but unfortunately the creature won't be held for long... Sequel to the 1954 horror classic The Creature from the Black Lagoon is admittedly a come-down from the original, but manages to be a fairly entertaining follow up. The biggest flaw with this film is the fact that the title monster loses some of the mystery that made it so frighteningly good in the first film, as our monster is literally placed for all to see. Still, director Jack Arnold's return proves to be helpful. The monster is still an impressive sight. B movie hero John Agar heads a pretty decent cast with Lori Nelson as a likable female in distress. Look for a young Clint Eastwood as a lab assistant. ** 1/2 out of ****",
         "A group of scientist go back to the Black Lagoon to capture the Creature. From there he is taken to an aquarium in Florida for research. The Creature develops a sort of \"crush\" on one of the female scientists, escapes, and kidnaps her. Can the Creature be stopped? While it's the weakest of the series, I probably rate Revenge of the Creature higher than most other people who claim to be fans. It definitely didn't deserve the MST3K treatment. The love story and escape work for me. I especially enjoy the scenes of the Creature terrorizing the guests and workers at the aquarium. Good stuff. One of the problems I have with the movie is understanding the actions of the so-called scientists. First, they head of to the Black Lagoon and proceed to dynamite the place to capture the Creature. They actually seem willing to kill every other living animal to get the Creature. Is that the way real scientists operate? And while I understand the point of the experiments they perform on the Creature once in Florida, the scientists seem a little too anxious to administer the shock treatment to the Creature. It's just not very realistic, even by 1950s horror/sci-fi movie standards. If you've never seen Revenge of the Creature, be on the look-out for an uncredited and VERY young Clint Eastwood in his first movie role.",
         "This movie is a sequel to Creature from the Black Lagoon. The creature basically gets captured and taken to Florida and stuck in an aquarium. Scientist study, him and then he gets loose. That is basically all there is to it. John Agar is the scientist and he is as wooden as ever. The gal in this one is pretty cute though and the monster looks all right especially considering it is the 50's. The monster doesn't look to threatening in a pool though so the fact it is in an aquarium really takes away from the movie. At the end the monster kidnaps the girl and Agar has to find her. I still don't think though that you can use a shocking pole underwater without getting electrocuted yourself and I don't think that some creature is going to care about a globe on a stick. And why bring a creature into basically a marine land type setting where if it escapes it can do the most damage. And where did these guys buy the chain to hold the creature cause it doesn't hold up well. On the plus side you get to see Clint Eastwood make a brief appearance.",
         "The deadly Gill Man returns in this sequel where a change in venue really doesn't do it any favours. It's just not quite the same without the Amazon setting; as a result, the overwhelming atmosphere and sense of mystery of the original are nowhere to be found here. That's not to say that the basic story is bad. It's a logical enough extension of the story of the original in which the Gill Man is successfully captured and brought to Florida's Ocean Harbor oceanarium. While he's on display he's subjected to various experiments (it would be pretty hard not to feel some sympathy for the poor beast) while the \"beauty and the beast\" theme is continued and the creature fixates on a lovely young scientist named Helen (Lori Nelson). The always likable John Agar is the lead here, and does his usual solid job. A good supporting cast includes John Bromfield as the macho Joe Hayes and Nestor Paiva, reprising his role of Lucas from the first film. Nelson is fine eye candy, even if she won't make anybody forget Julie Adams. A very young Clint Eastwood makes his first (uncredited) screen appearance as a none too bright lab assistant who misplaces a rat. The main problem with \"Revenge of the Creature\" is the fact that by the very nature of its tale it suffers from the Showing The Monster Too Much syndrome. Still, as mentioned, seeing what the creature is subjected to here will certainly strike a chord with the audience. You wish that humanity would have just left him the hell alone. The underwater photography is still wonderful, and there are some very effective moments, such as Agar and Nelson having a carefree swim not knowing just how close the creature is. Director Jack Arnold, also returning from \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\", does his usual capable job. While not in the same league as its predecessor, this is still watchable enough, if slow and talky at times. No matter what, it's always fun to see the Gill Man do his thing, so fans of the Universal-International product of the 1950s should be adequately entertained. Seven out of 10.",
         "Revenge Of The Creature (1955): John Agar, Lori Nelson, John Bromfield, Nestor Paiva, Clint Eastwood, Ricou Browning, Tom Hennesy, Grandon Rhodes, Dave Willock, Robert Williams, Charles Crane, Diane DeLaire, Charles Gibb, Brett Halsey, Bert Stevens, Charles Victor...Director Jack Arnold, Screenplay William Alland, Martin Berkeley. This is the sequel to Universal Pictures' \"Creature From The Black Lagoon\" (1954) using the same formula as the first but with different actors. \"Creature\" was such a hit that audiences flocked to see the story unfold in two more films. Despite the campiness to this film and the 3-D thrills of watching the Creature run amok in the city, it's still a fine quality film in many ways. John Agar and Lori Nelson star as Professor Ferguson and Helen, a teacher and student couple (not uncommon in the 50's world of academia) who journey back to the Amazon river in search of the Creature, possibly talked about by word of mouth from the original expedition in the first film. As luck has it, they come across the Creature and use tranquilizers to subdue him into a comatose state. They take him back to the US, to a lab and tank in Florida where they conduct various tests on him. They find that he is indeed half-man and half-fish, the last of his kind, a creature unlike any other. But soon, the experiments and the zoo-like environment anger the Creature and what's more, he becomes jealous of the budding romance between the Professor and Helen. Before long, he breaks loose from his tank, kills fellow scientist Joe Hayes (John Bromfield) and runs amok in the coast of Florida. He soon stalks Helen and abducts her at a party in plain sight of the guests. A monster hunt conducted by Police and authorities ensues. This riveting sequel has the same music by Herman Stein - who employs a dissonant passage to mark the Creature's motif- and has excellent 3-D style cinematography which was a big draw for audiences in the 50's. \"Revenge\" was the highest grossing box-office film of its kind at this time and the most exciting of the three movies. The first was a classic but was layered with mystery and \"Heart of Darkness\" style adventure, and the last film was a hurried and sloppy affair. This one got it right in terms of action and adventure. A permanent classic in 50's cinema, don't miss your chance to see Clint Eastwood before his rise to Hollywood stardom as a lab scientist working with mice early in the film. The script, cinematography and music, as well as fine acting (with just the right touches of humor here and there) make a great sequel to \"Black Lagoon\". There's also the sensuality of the \"swimming/underwater sequences\". Perhaps a bit sexy for the time was the scene in which the Professor and Helen kiss passionately, clinging together under water. Another audience-pleaser was the fact that in each of the Creature film we have a physically fit and beautiful actress who could swim and the object of the Creature's lust. The \"Creature\" movies spawned a 1970's novel, Comic Books/Graphic Novels, a pin ball machine, great Halloween Costumes and to many, fond drive-in memories.",
         "The Gill Man is captured from it's Black Lagoon home and is studied in the Ocean Harbor oceanarium by Professor Clete Ferguson(John Agar)and student Helen Dobson(Lori Nelson). Joe Hayes(John Bromfield)is in charge of keeping him chained in the aquarium and fed. Trying to teach him to understand commands such as stopping and eating properly, they shock the poor creature with a prod. Soon the Gill Man breaks free from his watery prison with panic reaching great heights. It wishes to mate with Helen who has fallen in love with Clete. As they travel on a cruise through the waters of Jacksonville, Florida down the river, the Gill Man follows biding it's time until Helen is vulnerable. Kidnapping her, Clete will join forces with a police and search party to find them. Straight-forward and simple plot sets up the thrilling final twenty or so minutes with the Gill Man killing anyone who gets in it's way. There's one startling scene where two college kids run up on Helen's body washed ashore as the Gill Man was away momentarily. It takes one kids and tosses him into a palm tree while he strangles another. But, the middle part of the film shows Gill Man's desperate attempts to free itself from a watery cage it didn't ask for. The group who study him realize the Gill Man is sensitive to bright light and must return to the water ever so often to replenish itself so that it will not suffocate on dry land. These weaknesses expose the Gill Man who is able to remain uncaught for a while at the end as it runs the shore with a weakened Helen often unconscious. Good suspense built at the end using the idea that the Gill Man could attack from the bushes anytime. But, director Jack Arnold(who helmed the first masterpiece)shows that despite it's faults, the Gill Man is an intelligent and patient creature who can strategize and hide really well. Having such strength, fear strikes anyone who dares face it off alone. If you wanted to see the Gill Man more, this sequel gives you your money's worth. Some striking under water sequences.",
         "Back in the Upper Amazon River Valley, an expedition headed by Professor Clete Ferguson (John Agar) attempts to locate the missing link first introduced in the previous year's \"Creature From the Black Lagoon\". With only Nestor Paiva as Captain Lucas on hand from the original cast, the beast is quickly located and subdued via a series of explosive charges set about his watery domain. Upon arrival at his new home in Marineland Park, the Creature is shackled in a holding tank where scientists can study his behavior and determine that he \"just misses being human\". Lori Nelson portrays college student and budding scientist Helen Dobson, object of the affections of both Professor Ferguson and the Creature. Throughout the film, no matter where Helen and the professor happen to be, the Gill-Man without the help of mapquest, is able to pinpoint their exact location - it's uncanny. And that's saying something, as sightings of the escaped monster were reported in the film as far ranging as Norfolk, Virginia to Panama - this guy did get around! The strength of the Creature is established in the film, where viewers could only guess at before. On his escape into the ocean from the Marineland tank, he easily overturns a car that stands in his path. Later on he throws a hapless victim halfway across the beach into some palm trees with ease. Contrast this effort with the underwater grappling scenes with the scientists in this and the prior film, where the opponents managed to get away relatively unharmed. It all suggests that the Creature's abilities were manufactured on the fly without much thought given to it's potential or limitations. For all of the film's inconsistencies though, it's still campy fun and as enjoyable as any of the schlock follow ups to the more serious Universal originals, such as the Mummy sequels. And lest I forget, probably the best unexpected treat of the movie - Clint Eastwood in his screen debut for just a brief moment, trying to figure out what happened to a missing lab mouse!",
         "The first sequel to 1954's low-budget hit \"Creature From the Black Lagoon\" looks even more cut-rate than its predecessor, despite that film's financial success. An exploration team in the Upper Amazon manages to capture the Creature quite easily (by setting off explosives in the lagoon which render the Gill-man incapacitated). A scientist hears the news and puts himself in charge once the Gill-man is shipped to an aquatic park in Florida, where he performs tests on the Creature with the hope (one presumes) he can be taught to obey tasks like a trained porpoise. Naturally, the Gill-man doesn't like being prodded with an electric pole or swiping at a ball on a chain--however, a pretty blonde science student has caught his eye (when a local newscaster tries inducing public panic after the Gill-man escapes, we know that all he really wants is the woman). While the first Creature feature wasn't exactly clever or witty, it had terrific 'jungle' ambiance and shimmering black-and-white photography. With the exception of a swimming duet between John Agar and Lori Nelson, the underwater visuals here are muddy or fuzzy (mainly due to overtures to the 3-D process). Nelson has her pick between strapping explorer John Bromfield (who could be Richard Egan's twin brother) and lab professor John Agar (who looks so out-of-shape, his clothes hang off him). Most viewers will end up rooting for the Gill-man who, in one instance, protects his lady-love by flinging a college student against a tree (a special effects scene I thought was well-done, but one many fans feel belies the film's low-end production cost). Clint Eastwood makes his debut as a lab tech (you hear his unmistakable voice before you see his face), and there are some good location scenes shot at Marineland, but the script fails to come up with one good idea after the Creature escapes. Followed in 1956 by the final chapter, \"The Creature Walks Among Us\". ** from ****",
         "Jack Arnold returns to direct this sequel, which sees another expedition return to the amazon(with Nestor Paiva reprising his role as the captain) to look for the remains of the creature, only to discover it still lives. They manage to capture it, and bring it to Florida for study, where it is put in a giant tank at an amusement park. John Agar and Lori Nelson play the scientists studying it, though it resents its captivity and escapes, causing mayhem in its wake. OK sequel isn't particularly original or surprising, but deserves some credit for creating viewer sympathy for this poor creature, which doesn't deserve this treatment, and only wants to return home. Look for Clint Eastwood in his film debut as a clumsy assistant to John Agar!",
         "Yep, the gill-man from \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\" is back! This time, they capture him and put him in a Florida aquarium. But sure enough, the poor sucker has the hots for a beautiful young woman. \"Revenge of the Creature\" is simply a fun movie to watch. Admittedly, a lot of it is VERY dated, but we can understand that. To be certain, a specific shot of Lori Nelson must have given millions of boys their first carnal experience. Of course, one of the most significant things about this movie is the appearance of Clint Eastwood in his debut: he plays the lab technician who can't find his mouse. Dirty Harry isn't feeling so lucky in that scene after all! Anyway, it's the sort of movie that you just watch to enjoy. They must have had fun making it. Also starring John Agar (Shirley Temple's first husband). Like I said: millions of boys must have LOVED that one shot of Lori Nelson!"
