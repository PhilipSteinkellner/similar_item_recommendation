         "Another ponderous example of Arzner's apparent disdain for men and marriage. (Either good men turn bad or bad men reform only through the love of a good woman.) The film does contain a few, as Billy Wilder would say, \"drop the popcorn bag\" moments, to its credit; but overall, it's a dark, unimaginative story, painted with the very broad strokes and heavy hand of the director. A virtue, since Pre-Code, it treats illicit love and extra-marital affairs with a refreshing boldness; yet pre-1960s, it manages to retain that \"Golden Era\" emphasis on romance to the extent that its plot allows. But the acting here is the redeeming feature. Claudette Colbert, true to form, quietly smolders as a private secretary-cum-wife caught between the romantic propositions of two businessmen. Fredric March is surprisingly convincing as both a jilted playboy and the turned-better hero. One of the most fantastic pieces of acting I've seen involves a scene between them, where married Colbert again rejects -- though with great desire to do otherwise -- his now-honorable, but extra-marital advances. The film is worth seeing just for this scene. The supporting cast ranges widely. Owsley delivers a snicker-worthy portrayal of the \"other man\", but Charlie Ruggles and Ginger Rogers take in his supporting slack with hilarious style.",
         "We've all had to sit through those tedious sexual harassment videos at work � bland, patronizing productions that are required viewing for all new employees. Companies could make the experience a whole lot more fun if they just showed this film instead. Moustache-sporting Fredric March is wealthy CEO Jerry Stafford, a debonair gadabout who secretly pines for his cute and unattached secretary Julie Traynor (Claudette Colbert). Not so secretly, actually � within the first ten minutes Stafford hits on Julie with abandon and then steals a kiss which leaves her flustered. He brushes it off with a \"I was surprised just as much as you were\" (though a careful reviewing of the scene confirms that he wasn't surprised at all), then pops open the wine � they're having lunch in his office, natch � and asks her to go on a cruise around the world with him. Safe to say, this guy would be in white collar prison these days. Even better, a few scenes later Julie marries her low-incomed broker of a fiancé (Philip Craig, as played by the Pee Wee Herman-looking Monroe Owsley); she reports to work the following Monday to tell Stafford she won't go on that cruise with him after all, on account of marriage. Stafford's response? He fires her! I should mention here that Jerry Stafford is the hero of this film. Yes, we're certainly in the world of 1930s cinema. Stafford doesn't turn out to be the biggest cad. That would be Craig, who by his and Julie's first anniversary has become wealthy, due mostly to the money Stafford has given his brokerage firm. Craig loses all of his newfound wealth on a silk deal Stafford cautioned against. Only problem is, Craig used some of Stafford's money as well�without telling him. Destitute, Julie goes to Stafford and asks for money, offering herself in exchange. Here the movie becomes like the 1930 version of \"The Cheat\" (available on the Pre-Code Hollywood DVD set), with foul play, accidental shootings, and exonerations. Only in this movie no one gets branded. This was the second of four on screen pairings for Colbert and March. The following year they reunited for DeMille's \"Sign of the Cross\" and, a month after that, for Mitchell Leisen's \"Tonight Is Ours\" (filmed in late '32 but released in January '33 � and ostensibly credited to director Stuart Walker, who according to all and sundry did nothing). I enjoy these two together, though apparently Colbert didn't; March was notorious for getting a bit too \"familiar\" with his leading ladies. Colbert reportedly disliked the man � there are stories of March wandering around \"in a daze\" on the set of \"Sign of the Cross,\" he was so nuts about her. Overall, a predictable melodrama that's most memorable for its (nowadays) jawdropping displays of sexual harassment in the workplace and the fact that it features three celebrities (Colbert, March, and a twenty one year-old Ginger Rogers) on the brink of their still-enduring fame. Dorothy Arzner's directorial work is okay, but nothing incredible -- the camera's static most times and, other than a solemn scene of Claudette walking up a hauntingly-lit staircase toward the end of the film, there aren't many novel shots. Arzner's work was much better in her subsequent film with March, \"Merrily We Go To Hell\" (also included on the Pre-Code Hollywood DVD set).",
         "Fredric March is an important businessman with a beautiful secretary (Claudette Colbert) whom he depends on for practically everything to make a perfect business. Sick of the usual women in his life, he asks her out on a date, and she accepts...reluctantly. He may be handsome but she has a promising young stockbroker (Monroe Owsley) in her life and when March suddenly proposes, she announces to him that she just married Owsley that very morning! So what does a rejected boss do? Fire her, of course, and she doesn't bat an eyelash. March then takes it upon himself to hire Owsley to handle his own investments, and it is pretty obvious that his intentions are not honorable. Made back in the day when a secretary could be a toy and sexual harassment wasn't a phrase used by H.R. directors, this is surprisingly bold not only for its subject matter but for the fact that it had a female director, the now legendary Dorothy Arzner who played in \"the boy's club\" of Hollywood long before women began to take an interest in doing more than either editing movies, creating costumes or climbing onto the casting couch in order to get ahead. March plays a very amoral character, one so determined to get what he wants that he's not afraid of losing his shirt if that's what it takes. Colbert is lovely and sensible, but the man she marries instead of March is far too weak to stand up to what is obviously a trap. This makes the marriage difficult to root for even though you certainly don't want to see March win, either. Charlie Ruggles is hysterically funny as March's pal who complains about his brain barking like a dog after a night of carousing and drinking. His love interest is none other than a very young Ginger Rogers who gets to play a Gracie Allen type character here, commenting on the origins of her family name: Mother's name Smythe and father's name Smith, so she chose to go by the shorter first name: Hemingway! The film is pretty fast moving for an early talkie so it never becomes dull, but the subject matter is one that many today might find distasteful."
