         "Normally the name of screenwriter Kim Fupz Aakesonon a Danish film is enough to make my blood freeze. His proletaristic, mind-numbing dialog (mostly consisting of ummmm.... f****... errr s***) is enough to drive me up the wall, and the terribly dull \"everyday\" (as if people died in car crashes or went insane were everyday things) stories were tiresome. So my expectations for this film were low. Yet I was to be surprised: Director Jacob Thuesen has turned the \"everyday\" story on it's head, and created a searing critique of the welfare state, the middle class, and society's (particularly the legal system) increasing dependence on experts, and their influence on people's lives. Troels Lyby is amazing as the father accused of incest, and for once Aakeson's dialogue is fascinating and sharp. For a Danish film it is impressively edited and filmed, and the visual style (especially the unconventional character introductions) is fittingly cold and edgy. The only problem with this film is that it goes on for about ten minutes too long, and the fact that Sofie Graabøl is simply too tried and tested in this sort of film to be anything else than tiresome. Overall, a greatly underrated movie. I might actually look forward to Aakeson's next film.",
         "Anklaget \"Accused\" Directed by Jacob Thuesen (2005) The every day life of an ordinary family father is shredded to pieces, when he is accused of having had intercourse / incest with his 13-year old daughter. We follow the father Henrik, and how his life and whole existence is turned upside down. Even before the case against him begins, everybody except his loving wife and his best friend now takes an extra look at him. And when he gets be remanded in custody he is close to devastation. This is an original story that deals with a very controversial and unpleasant subject. It is disturbing but though realistic, thanks to the actors and director who handles this case excellent. Troels Lyby gives a great leading performance as the accused father, and in the two supporting roles as his wife and as his best friend we find Sofie Gråbøl and Paw Henriksen who solves their roles very good. Especially Sofie Gråbøl gives her character depth and credibility. 8/10",
         "Danish film editor and director Jacob Thuesen's feature film debut which was written by Danish screenwriter Kim Fupz Aakeson, was screened In competition at the 55th Berlin International Film Festival in 2005, in the Northern Lights section at the 16th Stockholm International Film Festival in 2005 and is a Danish production which was shot on locations in Denmark and produced by Danish producer Thomas Heinesen. It tells the story about Henrik, a swimming teacher who lives in Copenhagen with his wife Nina. Though happily married, Henrik and Nina has a fourteen-year-old daughter named Stine who is not doing well at school and who is seeing a clinician. Henrik and Nina thinks that Stine is going through the same problems as any other teenager, but after telling her psychologist something about her father, she is sent to an institution. Henrik and Nina are shocked when they learn what their daughter has said about her father and their situation becomes even more difficult when Henrik is arrested by the police. Finely and acutely directed by Danish filmmaker Jacob Thuesen, this character-driven family drama which is narrated mostly from the male main character's point of view draws an engaging portrayal of a family who is dissolved when the teenage daughter accuses her father of incest. While notable for its naturalistic urban milieu depictions, fine production design by Danish production designer Mia Steensgaard, cinematography by Danish cinematographer Sebastian Blenkov and use of sound, this condensed and concentrated fictional story which examines themes such as doubt, trust, prejudice, guilt, parenting and family relations depicts an in-depth study of character. This austere though at times humorous and romantic, poignantly atmospheric and intimate examination of the troubles a married couple faces after their adolescent daughter claims that her father has molested her, is impelled and reinforced by its efficient narrative structure, incisively written dialog and the prominent and involving acting performances by Danish actor Troels Lyby and Danish actress Sofie Gråbøl. A mindful and gripping psychological drama which gained, among other awards, the Robert Award for Best Actor Troels Lyby and Best Actress Sofie Gråbøl at the 23rd Robert Awards in 2006 and the European Discovery- Prix Fipresci Award Jacob Thuesen at the 18th European Film Awards in 2005.",
         "While the VERY last scene, of HENRIK in his Bath-robe, leaves one pondering about the message or intent..., this story's climatic build-up is -both- truthful and believable ! At first, tantalizing and intriguing for the first twenty minutes, the tension sets-in whence the councilors/lawyer's, is taken aback by HENRIK's attitude and questions ...; meanwhile we have the incredible interventions of (Sofie Grabol) NINA as a loving/warm/tender/sexually satisfied wife and mother ...; the (daughter's) STINE, mostly still-life presence and expressions are just incredible and beyond words ...! Mr. TROELS LYBY's presence & rendition is just extreme or too natural, Mrs. SOFIE GRABOL is just too much right as a Wife and Mother ... as well as a shining-out presence ... while either direction and photography are unquestionably good. Shortly-put, this is {another} of a very limited number of quality films, with subject or renewing script's visualization ! P.S.: Sofie Grabol is a gorgeous and incredibly good actress. ... as proved with her lead in the recent \"The Killing\" three Danish TV's series ... !",
         "If Sofie Gråbøl gets any better than in this movie, it's scary!! I hope for her that she can keep on improving her acting, but I fear that she will be on a \"Mission Impossible\" if she has to do better than this performance. She is simply outstanding, and she singlehandedly saves the movie, when the script runs away with it round an easy Hollywood corner, that makes everything fit too well into script-mathematics. Just watched the extra material on DVD and was a bit embarrassed on behalf of director Jacob Thuesen, when after meeting the press at The Berlinale (Film Festival) he seemed surprised, that his audience wanted to talk about the subject of the film (incest), rather than the \"filmtechnical matters\" (which he had hoped for). Proves to me, that this was another film where the filmmakers aim for the perfect effective drama, rather than caring for what is on their mind and heart. Damn effective though - not least through the first 4/5 of the movie."
