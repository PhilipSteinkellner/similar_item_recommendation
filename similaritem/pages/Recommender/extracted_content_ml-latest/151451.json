         "One of the most amazing movies I have ever seen! Angels do exist, and the magic of this movie that for sure was truly inspired by authentic angels takes us to their world. Not only up there in heaven, but here and now surrounding us all. This movie reached humanity in a much needed hour, in a critical time, while reminding each one of us of the embracing reality of the entire hierarchy of angels and the supreme absolute that is beyond and within us all. A real opener of the heart! To help us understand what true love is - love as love, not as an attraction from other centers of our being.",
         "Lovely mix of goofiness and reality with a lot of hope. If you are a hopeless romantic or just someone who wants to warm their heart - this one is for you. Playing \"what if\" with an Angel. How about finding out what real love is? I'd say if after the movie is finished, you have a feeling of wanting to do something good, I'd say its worth it and then some! And don't mind some over cheesiness))",
         "what is the correct verdict in this case ? one - cruel/realistic - it is a sweet sentimental juice ? one - unrealistic but predictable - it is touching, irresistible and impressive ? or only - another Orthodox Russian movie. it is not very easy. but, remember. it is part of a tradition. and its message is necessary. to rebuild image about yourself. and about world. sure, it is naive and this is not a real virtue. but its message is perfect for few moments of each life. in same time, it is part of a dream who has not borders. and, in this search of existence sense it remains a tasty soup for soul. a small film about values and profound definition of love. a love story. but a special one.",
         "at first sigh - a naive, predictable story. pieces from Soviet comedies. crumbs from American romanticism of 1940. few spiritual references. slices from contemporary Russia. and the strange love story with the seductive flavor. a soup for soul, of course. but a hot one. because it has a small virtue - it is a typical romantic comedy but, in same measure, it is a real Orthodox movie. the angel is not charming or powerful or smart or the super hero. he is. almost as an accident. so, not The bishop's wife. in same measure, the reflection of the students life is one of the pillars who sustains the fragile story. and the realism becomes itself fantastic, transforming a not credible chain of events in convincing pledge for hope and courage to discover the other as part of yourself. so, a seductive show. and little more."
