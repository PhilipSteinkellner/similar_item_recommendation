         "This documentary is complicated and tricky to follow and leaves many questions unanswered, but it's poetic and moving and its subject is important. George Packer has written about how Iraqis who worked for the Americans have been left hanging. It happened to members of the Laotian military who worked for the Americans during the \"secret\" (or more accurately denied) bombing of Laos during the Vietnam war--a campaign justified by the fact that the North Vietnamese conduit, the Ho Chi Mihn Trail, ran through Laos. The US was also supporting the Royal Laotian Army \"nautralist' forces against the communist Pathet Lao, as well as training Laotians to fight in US operations. The film shows JFK talking about the need for Laos's \"neutrality\" (and its cooperation against the communists) and Nixon denying the bombing. Titles give staggering statistics of how many bombs were dropped on Laos over a nine-year period by US planes--more than in World Wars I and II combined. There is no information about how many Laotians were killed. When America lost the war in Vietnam and pulled out, it also abandoned Laos and its Laotian collaborators. This affected Thavisouk Phrasavath (\"Thavi\"), a lean, toothy man who appears at various ages in the film, with hair sometimes down to his waist or his shoulders, in a crew-cut, or short and slicked back. This may reflect his struggle for an identity. He is the narrator of the film, its central figure, and the filmmaker's collaborator. The film, shot over a 23-year period, is the saga of a family torn apart by war and collaboration with the US, ending in uneasy settlement in America. The film's Laotian title, 'Nerakhoon,' actually means \"the betrayed ones.\" That is how Thavi came to think of his family members and those like them. Thavi grew up in Laos knowing only war. His father was one of those Laotian officers who, as he himself tells the camera, actually called in the American planes that dropped bombs on his country \"to save it.\" When the Americans abandoned Laos, the Pathet Lao took over. It was a happy moment, with celebration and singing everywhere. Then the Pathet came and took Thavi's father away for a reeducation \"seminar\"--imprisonment that lasted for years. From then on his family, his mother and nine children, lived in fear. Thavi, the eldest son, escaped on his own by swimming the Mekong River. In Thavi's words and images of the water, the film evokes that lonely swim, when he would have been happy to die if it came to that, to be \"gone and gone.\" Instead he woke up alive the next day in Thailand, and he became a street boy in Bankock for two years, when the rest of his family managed to come and they all went to a refugee camp. Well, not all: two elder sisters were not at home when the facilitator came to help the family flee across the river in a leaky boat, and their mother was forced to leave without them. 'The Betrayal' blends period footage with impressionistic images of flight through woods backed up by the surging music of Howard Shore, and there are shots of Thavi talking. There is no footage of the family before it fled, but Kuras compensates with shots of people doing similar things. The big shock is what happens to the family when the mother chooses for them to be sent to the US rather than France or Canada, and they are dumped unceremoniously in a very dangerous part of Brooklyn in 1970. Without a father, in this ugly, hostile environment, the various siblings revolted, the girls hanging out with \"bad\" boys, the brothers joining gangs. There is a back-and-forth in the film between Thavi's mother speaking in the eighties in anger and despair about the bad pass the family came to at that time (Kuris discovered them around 1985) and today, more serenely recalling nearly forty years of struggle. After fifteen years the father found them and visited them from Florida. Like the takeover of the Pathet Lao, this was another moment of hope and happiness followed by despair, when he revealed after a week that he had another wife and children in Florida and was returning to them. We see Thavi calling his father later and quietly begging him to come and take things in hand, to no avail. Later, Thavi attends the funeral of one of his step brothers in Florida--a gang victim, the same \"reds\" gang there as in New York. Thavi referred to the analogy with Iraq in an interview at the Witness documentary film festival. There are over two million Iraqi refugees from the US invasion and occupation, and only a tiny handful have been accepted into the US. I think this larger implication is what Kuras and Phrasavath seek to communicate with the film's mix of poetry and devastation: that more than once America has made this \"mistake\" (Thavi's gentle word) of abandoning its collaborators too often must learn not to keep making it. What has happened to the family today? The film, too impressionistic at points, doesn't give many details. They don't live in Brooklyn any more (too gentrified and expensive?). The mother lives in New Jersey with a daughter, Thavi lives in New York with a wife and small child. He made a trip back to Laos and was reunited with the two lost older sisters, a grandmother who died at 104, and other family members. And to look at the other siblings, they've settled down and stabilized, but we don't know how they managed that, or any of the specifics about them, or what Thavi does now--but clearly he's a filmmaker, and a spokesman on the issues brought up in 'The Betrayal.' He's edited two other films related to immigration and border-crossing issues and he edited this one. This is well-known DP Kuras' directorial debut. Despite its flaws this is still a rich document.",
         "I saw this documentary as the Sundance Film Festival last year. It had generated buzz as a great documentary of a Laotian family in a twenty year time spam. Film maker Ellen Turas and main subject Thanisouk Phrasabath share directorial credit. They were present at the screening for q and a and I do believe this documentary works on many levels as does the title itself. There's also several parts of this that are quite separate from each other. The first part is the history of Laos, particularly during the Vietnam crisis in the seventies. There's footage of President Kennedy, who gives the word Laos an interesting pronunciation, who stresses the importance of neutrality of the country. Nixon denies the bombing, which in fact, receives more bombs than the whole of Europe during the Second World War. Phrasabeth's voice-over shows footage of his dad who was serving in the Royal Laotian Army, the \"neutralist\" force fighting the communists. The dad becomes a prisoner of war while the rest of family pull together to escape. When the United States pulled out of the conflict, there was abandonment of the Laotians who worked with and for the Americans. That was seen by many as a betrayal. The next part of this documentary is the family living in America. Brooklyn, New York, to be exact. Here's where Karas begins to be put of the picture as the documentarian to this family. They are in a bad part where there's active gang life and much temptation for the siblings to be part of Asian gangs, the biggest being the Chinese, but they get by. The betrayal here, or more accurately, the betrayed ones, comes that the American Dream doesn't seem obtainable for this family. The next part is the family learning that the father did get out of Laos, is alive and living with his own, new family in Florida. There is a bittersweet reunion of father and mother. Sweet because the father is well. Bitter because the father makes the decision to go back to Florida. There would have been family betrayal in whatever decision he would have made. The documentary ends with a funeral. A step brother dies from gang violence. What's not lost here is that there are internal wars inside the United States. The irony is not lost on the film makers as they take us on this twenty-three year old journey. The betrayal is not just the racial conflicts, the territory conflicts or even the family conflicts. There are internal conflicts on how one has to deal with his own identity in terms with the rest of society.",
         "Although beautifully shot, given the components of such pure destruction and deceit it would have been very easy for this film to have just been just another tale of human and governmental failing and the individual casualties that are a result of such. Instead we find the subtle but brilliant parallels Thavi brings to the film, in his capacity as the film editor as well as the editing he has personally employed in his life, that places The Betrayal so far above its peers. The film, mirroring his life, exposes all of the devastating elements experienced and witnesses in his life yet it is his skill at editing that has allow these action to be exposed and acknowledged while not allowing them to dictate the soul of either the film or his life. Instead you will find, by design, a film and a person of peace and beauty, showing us that with proper editing, we like Thavi have the ability to create peace�inner peace and products of peace.",
         "This is a pretty good documentary as the layers unravel in a very nice and subtle way. It's truly a heartbreaking story on many levels. Using the Universe as my analogy pertaining to this documentary, one would see the Vietnam War in that moment as the Universe, how it destroyed many lives on multiple levels. Then one could see the country of Laos as an individual human being and how Laos suffered on multiple levels from the war. Then one can look at Thavi's family as a single atom, and see how they suffered immensely from the war. Then one could travel within that single atom and see the affects of how the kids grew up, the pain that the mother and family goes through learning their father remarried someone else as he now has a new family, etc. Which learning about the father remarrying almost breaks the viewers heart more than anything. I'm so interested though in how Thavi arrived at where he became to be, which is a bright filmmaker. One could look at Thavi and think he really doesn't look like much, but indeed he does amount to very much! I would love to see another documentary on how Thavi's family supported themselves, how they got money to live and who they got the money from? How Thavi got into filmmaking and where he acquired such good video camera's from? How he learned so much because there's a big gap there, which is fine, you can't put this documentary in a vacuum, which I understand they needed to just get down to brass tacks of what they were talking about, but I would love to see another documentary on all this other stuff."

         "The epic story of a family forced to emigrate from Laos after the chaos of the secret air war waged by the U.S. during the Vietnam War. Kuras has spent the last 23 years chronicling the family's extraordinary journey in this deeply personal, poetic, and emotional film.",
         "A Lao prophecy says, \"A time will come when the universe will break, piece by piece, the world will change beyond what we know.\" That time came for the small country of Laos with the clandestine involvement of the United States during the Vietnam War. By 1973, three million tons of bombs had been dropped on Laos in the fight to overcome the North Vietnamese, more than the total used during both world wars. With the rise of a Communist government in Laos, killings and arrests became common among those affiliated with the former government and the Americans. Families were torn apart-some finally emigrating to the U.S. In a collaboration spanning more than 20 years, Ellen Kuras works with Laotian co-director Thavisouk Phrasavath, the main subject of the film. Phrasavath takes us through his youth, his escape from persecution and arrest in Laos, his family's reunion and their journey as immigrants to America, and the second war they had to fight on the streets of New York City. Drawing on the techniques of experimental film and the traditions of Laotian culture, Nerakhoon (The Betrayal) is a tale about a country, a family, and a young man who discovers the power and resilience of the human spirit."
