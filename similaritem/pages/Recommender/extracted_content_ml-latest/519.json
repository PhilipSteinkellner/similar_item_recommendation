         "the first Robocop was amazing, Robocop 2 was a worthy sequel. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED!? half the cast was comedians, the acting was god awful, the script was stupid. I mean how do you go from solid R rated flicks to a PG 13? Now this film shows the fall of OCP, and many people jumping out of windows or shooting themselves. Ironically that's what anyone viewing this film would want to do. Which is why they don't have theatres on the top of buildings. this film should be erased from history, and maybe if they make another robocop call it robocop 3 again, to help people forget about this one. -50 out of 10",
         "This highly-disappointing sequel finds our hero going against law and order by siding with a group of down-and-outers who stand to lose their neighborhood because of evil corporate interests. Along the way Robo crashes cars, battles robot ninjas and flies through the air like a six-ton Superman. Alas, none of it can save ROBOCOP 3, a film into which very little real effort seems to have gone. When watching ROBOCOP 3, one can't help but think the producers lazily expected the well-established Robocop brand would simply sell itself this time around. Making matters worse, they tried to move away from a more adult-style of action and sci-fi and deliver something you might watch with older kiddies. I mean, robot ninjas??? What is this, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers? This thing even attempts to deliver a do-the-right-thing message, but the whole effort is so muddled and ridiculous it can't succeed (nor should a movie like this even try). I am willing to cut movies a lot of slack, but this one's a stinker. No wonder Robo was reduced to a cheap Canadian-filmed TV series following this disaster.",
         "Firstly if you don't like Robocop at all, then obviously leave this alone, if you've never seen Robocop, watch the first film, then come back and read the rest of this. Robocop started out as a hard ass cyborg, you simply wouldn't mess with (He even helped spawn a video game, in which he fought the Terminator, you've got to be Tough to be mentioned in the same breath as a Terminator - you get the point, he was hard) and, he was portrayed by Peter Weller, who did a good job. In number 2, Peter Weller was still there and Robocop was still fun and still tough, even if it wasn't a great movie. However, now on to the third film, take my advice and miss it, even for Robocop fans, there little here to enjoy, and this is why. Robert Burke, has replaced Peter Weller as Robocop, and i not knocking him as an actor (I Don't know much of his work), but he isn't Robocop, Period. Also Robocop is now as weak as a kitten, and Oh yes, and he can fly now too, Yawn! This movie simply insults the Robocop name, in every way, i can't think of a single reason to watch this film, it's another case of no sequels necessary (although Robocop 2 - wasn't all bad) 3/10",
         "When I was very little, I became a fan of the first 2 Robocop films. So when I heard they were going to release a third movie, I couldn't wait. Then I saw the movie, and couldn't believe what I had just saw. I was terrible. The story was actually good and could have worked. But they had to do what ruins a lot of other movies:add a little kid character. It also featured a very horribly written character of a robot ninja. And without Peter Weller from the first two movies, this movie just wasn't the same. And a PG-13 rating? The whole point of the Robocop movies was to make some of the most violent and swear-filled movies you'll ever see. So my advice to you would be to watch the first two Robocop films, and pretend this one was never made.",
         "Robocop 3 is an 'insult' to the classic original. First of all, the character of Robocop is played by someone else and the result is just plain embarrassing. The film is very soft on violence, which was a poor decision on the director's part because the original film is notorious for its excessiveness and loved by fans. A PG-RATED Robocop is just a desperate attempt to cash in on the wider audience, which proves that the film was made by profiteers, rather than film-makers. This film is so bad, it's literally dripping with cheese. Robocop flying is an unintentional funny moment in the film and the part where Robocop drives a car off a bridge and lands on all four wheels, is just plain ridiculous. This film was the nail in the Robocop franchise's coffin. I honestly wish that it had never been made.",
         "Righty ho, what went on here then? I can't believe they made this and saw fit to release it! It lacks nearly everything the original Robocop had....especially a big killer robot! Robocop 1 had ED-209. Rococop 2 had the huge vicious psycho cyborg Cain. Robocop 3 had a samurai robot that looked like a normal guy and if you managed to get a decent hit on him he would break like a dodgy little action figure! The director must have realised that this was a bad move half way through making the movie so he added a few more of these unmemorable villains to make up for the fact he didn't have a big impressive killer robot in it and failed miserably. Sorry but that sums it all up for me. There is of course a load of other faults that i won't go in to but that was the main fault when i watched it. A few little cool bits in this movie but the bad far outweighs the good. If this hadn't been so sucky we would have probably got treated to a Robocop 4! Damn! 3/10",
         "The Robocop idea went far enough with number 2. The third installment is just awful. Peter Weller had sense enough to stay away from this set. I enjoyed the first, thought the second was OK but hated this one. This story was contrived and the acting abysmal. When I began to watch this I had a feeling it was going to stink and sure enough, it did! Don't bother with this one.",
         "Robocop 3 (1993) was an unwanted sequel that helped killed a studio and sat on the shelf for over two years. Why was this movie made? Who knows, it didn't make a dime and the film makers tried to make him kid friendly which killed the series in the process. The movie was so unwanted that Peter Weller didn't want to reprise his role of Officer Murphy for a third time. Whilst the second film was extremely dark and depressing, the third installment swung wildly in the other direction. Two wrongs don't make a right. The director and writer Fred Dekkar should have known better. He made a couple of fun and watchable movies in the past. What ever made them click misfired on all cylinders in this boring and safe for the family sequel. Well, this movie killed it's box office draw. Nobody wanted to see a kid friendly Robocop. The next time it appeared was on the small screen in two syndicated television programs. Neither raised a big stink and Robocop went back into mothballs. A shame really because Robocop was cool. Hell, part two is a classic compared to this celluloid tripe. Recommended for die-hard Robocop fans. Other need not apply, except children who want to see Robocop in action.",
         "Before I begin, let me get this out in the open: Robocop 3 is easily the worst movie of the trilogy. OK, now the rest of the review. Though this is the worst movie of the series, Robocop 3 manages to find a way to redeem itself (be it intentionally or unintentionally) by being incredibly cheesy, and ultimately a load of fun! The film doesn't even really seem to be a direct continuation of the series, though it does reference the first movie several times via flashbacks. The story is just about as dull as it could get, and the acting leaves much to be desired. Not to mention, the one saving grace this film could have had (special effects) does nothing to help save the movie from falling to \"B-Movie\" status. I'm not sure why Peter Weller was not brought back for this one, but I think he was wise to avoid it. Robocop has been reduced to cheesy one-liners, and badly choreographed fight scenes. However, I think this adds to the movie's charm. The film seems to take a very tongue-in-cheek look into the world of Robo, and this saves it from being a complete failure. Also, it seems as if the writers or director were watching a lot of Japanese anime, one of the main villains in the film is a ninja who is seemingly unstoppable; many of his scenes are so stylized you'd swear you're watching an anime. Rip Torn also adds to the film's silliness as the head of the corrupt corporation, OCP. He makes the main conflict in the film not even seem threatening due to the fact that he isn't menacing at all. Overall I'd say this film is more of a comedy than a sci-fi flick. It contains so many cheesy moments that it's best enjoyed with a small group of friends (my close friend opined once \"This is what Mystery Science Theater 3000 was made for,\" how right he was). If you are a fan of the series because of the grittiness and realism displayed in the first, avoid this entry. However, if you're looking for a good cheesy popcorn style sci-fi film, by all means, get some friends together and have fun! This film was made to be laughed at!",
         "This is the worst possible turn the series could take. Form the violence in the first movie and the mindless violence in the second, the third movie is suddenly as lame as possible. First off, let me say I don't understand why people find this third movie a better movie then the second. Because it tries a story line with a little more thought in it? True perhaps, but that's all it's got going for it. One painfull moment follows the other. I like lists, so let's list some. <<!!!As always, SPOILERS ahead!!!>> A black woman who's not even 40 calls herself an old woman during the deportation, the deportation itself is a complete fraud (pick out a cop and follow him around. It shows that their instructions were just \"run in that direction and act mean, but for crying out loud, don't hurt yourselves!\"), the laptop reprogramming of the ED-9something, cops who don't know how to defend themselves when they've got guns and the punkers got sticks, robocop who loses every fight he's in, dream sequences on screen like a soap opera (in the first movie they were just a read-out of the brain activity. A lot more real), Robocop obviously not weighting anymore then a normal man these days (2 of the rebels carry him) and the japanese man responsible for the killing can just walk around among his victims, never in danger. And do I even have to mention the flying he's doing? Add unmemorable villains and not one engaging action sequence and this movie has really nothing going for it. The decission to have no blood in the movie is almost funny when they have no trouble having a couple of suicides in the story. The story itself, isn't that worth it then, one might say? Let's just say it's impressive how they can make an almost epic theme reminding of the holocaust so incredible boring and unadmospheric. I certainly didn't care for any character, that's for sure. At least Robocop 2 had action and humour going for it. 2/10 (hey, it still is robocop)"

         "Having recently been taken over by Kanemitsu Corporation, OCP - known officially as Omni Consumer Products (but increasingly rechristened \"Oppressive Capitalist Pigs\" by Detroiters) - finally begins its project for the creation of Delta City over the trampled remains of soon-to-be-devastated Detroit. As part of its execution, a special goon squad (\"rehabs\"), headed by Commander Paul McDaggett, is deployed to evacuate residents by force and tear down the city (simultaneously, if need be). Amidst the chaos, a young, tech-savvy girl named Nikko, orphaned by the rehabs, takes shelter with a citizens resistance group that's banded together to strike back at OCP, first by raiding the Police Department Armory Warehouse for weapons. Murphy, dispatched to chase them down, ignores the order upon hearing a call for back up from Anne Lewis and other officers stranded within cop-killing Splatterpunk territory. This violation leads OCP to an executive decision: cut Murphy's past memories for good (a directive that technician Dr. Lazarus defies). With McDaggett unlawfully attacking citizens, Murphy finds himself in conflict over his prime directives: (1) serve the public trust, (2) protect the innocent, (3) uphold the law, yet (4) never oppose an OCP officer (who's in violation of the first three). Hampered in the ensuing mêlée against McDaggett and the rehabs, Lewis is killed and Robo severely damaged (but taken in by the rebels through Nikko). To keep Robocop off McDaggett's back, Kanemitsu deploys Otomos (android ninjas) to handle the cyborg once and for all. As an all-city battle looms, forces draw together for a stake in the final outcome.",
         "Omni Consumer Products (OCP) begins its plan for the creation of Delta City. As part of this program, a special Rehab squad headed by Commander Paul McDaggett is deployed as they evacuate the city in a forced manner tearing down part of the city. In this chaos, a young girl named Nikko is left alone and picked up by a group of citizens joining together to strike on OCP, first raiding a Police Department Armory Warehouse. Murphy is sent to the chase of this group, but he eventually ignored the order when he received a back up call from Anne Lewis and the other officers who were attacked by a group of Splatterpunks. This violation leads to the decision of finally cutting Murphy's past memories for good, as he finds himself between the line of Law Enforcement and Popular Opinion when the law is beginning to be corrupted, and he is betrayed by the law he sought to uphold when Lewis is killed, and he is left for dead... all of this thanks to Directive 4: \"Any attempt to arrest an officer of OCP results in Shut Down.\" At the same time, the new younger CEO of OCP begins relations with a Japanese Cybernetics Corporation headed by a man named Kanemitsu for Monetary support, leading into the deployment of the advanced android Otomo, a fully skilled Ninja with full human appearance, but still a machine. Slowly as all of Detroit joins the Motor City's cause, including the Police Department, McDaggett sees use for the arrested criminals to create his own army of criminals to strike down the City's militia once and for all. The only hope, Murphy overcoming the control placed on him by Directive 4, and bring down this corrupted plan.",
         "It's some time after Robocop put an end to the \"Nuke\" production, and things have changed dramatically since. Though OCP's CEO known as \"The old man\" has gone, his \"Delta City\" project has begun, but not before OCP's buy out by the Japanese robotic company known as \"Kanemitsu.\" It has formed its own police force to flush people from their homes and send them to OCP's special rehabilitation program; however, a little girl named Nikko escapes the program and is now with a group of rebels. Robocop and his partner, Anne Lewis, come upon activity at a church, where the OCP force led by a man named Paul McDagget is about to wipe out the rebels along with families. Robocop is heavily damaged by McDagget's forces and Lewis killed. Meanwhile, the new CEO of OCP receives notice that Kanemitsu will help with the construction of Delta City, sending Otomo, their ninja android, to assist. When the rebels repair Robocop, he seeks out McDagget, unaware of Otomo hunting for him.",
