         "If you like MMA, you owe it to yourself to see \"Fightville.\" This documentary takes you to the minor leagues of MMA, to the de facto \"farm system\" that exists for would-be's, poseurs and wannabe's who dream of making it to the Big Stage of the UFC. Some may make it to those big leagues. Most will not. \"Fightville\" depicts unsparingly the blood, sweat and tears of those who undertake the journey. Much of the film depicts the rise of Dustin Poirier, who now is an up and comer in the UFC. (In fact, he is headlining a UFC event on May 15th against \"The Korean Zombie\" in Fairfax, VA.) Equally compelling, though, are the stories of the fighters whose quest for pugilistic fame and monetary fortune fell short, those who juggle personal life turmoil, injuries, jobs and broken families to chase their dream. This is a compelling slice of life view of small town MMA in southern Louisiana. In the midst of this unlikely setting, we see the MMA training facility run by Tim Credeur, an MMA fighter, trainer and former contestant on \"The Ultimate Fighter\" reality show. Whether speaking to the camera about the lifestyle price to be paid, in beating the #$%$ of a fighter who has been skimping on training, Credeur embodies a 21st century manifestation of The Warrior Ethos. It is an ethos he tries to impart to all of his fighters � unflinching, all in and no excuses. Also fascinating is the side story of the Gill \"The Thrill\" Guillory, who promotes these small town MMA events. He runs the business on a shoestring, engaging his wife and kids to help him promote the events. He sets up the stage, contracts for the venues at state fairgrounds, rodeo parks and coliseums, promotes the fighters and does everything but wash dishes and sell programs. His passion for the fight game is palpable. \"Fightville\" also features a very slick soundtrack, which I really enjoyed. In short, if you are an MMA fan, watching \"Fightville\" will be a treat, like the biggest slice of your favorite pie for dessert. Each story line is fascinating. The tale is often bitter, occasionally sweet and offers a glimpse into modern day gladiators who continue a centuries-old tradition that propels some men to enter the cage to test their mettle. Two thumbs up for \"Fightville'!!",
         "Full of heart, the documentary Fightville follows two perspective MMA fighters as they try to become professionals. Set in Louisiana, Fightville is gritty, and unflinching in its portrayal of the young men pursuing their dreams in the world of mixed martial arts. It's beautifully shot, compelling, and deep. The fighters, their trainers, and the fight promoters have thought long and hard about fighting, and it's place in the world, and they aren't afraid to tell it like it is. Everyone in the film is well spoken, and their insights are interesting. But more important than all of that is the story of the fighters. They pursue their own unique American dreams in two very different ways. One is driven, and single minded. The other wavers, and questions. I found myself rooting hard for both of them. I won't spoil it, but the tension built until the end. The climax had me at the edge of my seat, and the payoff was well worth the price of admission. Before watching Fightville, I wasn't a huge fan of MMA. I've changed my mind. These guys are big hearted warriors, who dream big. Their pursuit of those dreams is a story worth watching.",
         "Fightville was an insightful look at the intense world of MMA hopefuls fighting for the chance to earn a pro contract. The directors portrayed the characters in a way that made you root for them and feel like you were right there watching them struggle and succeed. This film will appeal to both UFC fans and non fans alike. The young fighters featured from the Lafayette, Louisiana area are as authentic as they come. The raw footage captures the intensity and sacrifice these warriors make. UFC and other pro fighting circuits are the quickest growing professional sports franchise worldwide. Young wrestlers, MMA fighters and boxers are gravitating toward the sport as a place where they can continue to pursue their dreams of being the ultimate warrior. Fightville shows us how they do it.",
         "This film takes you inside the lives of people who are literally fighting for survival. They are doing everything they can to just win and fight another day. From the promoter to the fighters themselves this is an look inside the cage that left me in awe and with a deeper understanding of not only the sport but the people inside it. The film makers did great job getting interviews with the fighters, trainers, and promoters to present a amazingly real and close up document of the facts of their lives. I would also add that this does not glorify the violence of the sport but the commitment that all those involved have toward each other. It is beautifully shot and thoughtfully presented. I recommend this not just to fight fans but everyone because at the end of the day this is not a fight film. It is a survival film and a story of hope.",
         "The film is so much more than a look at mixed martial arts as a sport. It covers the personal stories of some very interesting individuals. We come to know some up-and-coming mixed martial arts fighters. They are humble, hard-working but serious in the octagon. The filmmakers are adept in capturing the stories, the fighting, and the surroundings. The cinematography is great and you'll see what I mean from the still photos. Whether you are a fan of the sport or not, I think you'll find something to relate to in the film. We are all striving towards a goal or goals and sometimes we achieve them and others, we have to pick up the pieces and try again.",
         "Bam! Bam! Bam! WARNING! - If you are someone who simply cannot enjoy (even slightly) watching a man being royally pulverized by another, then \"Fightville\" certainly isn't gonna register as entertainment for you. But, on the other hand - If you wanna see the real thing here where a bunch of very dedicated young men (who seem to have a lot of inner-rage to vent) punch the living daylights outta each other (all in the name of glory with little or no monetary gain), then this well-produced documentary (from 2011) is certainly worth a view. Through interviews with MMA fighters, their trainers (and, yes, even opinions from concerned parents) - Fightville introduces the viewer to these feisty, pugilistic, young lads from Gladiator Academy (located in Lafayette, Louisiana) who travel around the State with promoter Gil Guillory in order to proudly demonstrate (to the ever-curious public) all there is to know about anger-management, one-on-one combat and the disciplined art of MMA fighting.",
         "Fightville is a documentary mostly based on two fighters (Dustin Poirier and Albert Stainback) In dead end Louisana the documentary covers both their stories and explores their Personalities/Psychographics through MMA (Mix Martial Arts). MMA is hugely frowned upon and called 'Human cock fighting' but this documentary prevails that MMA is a way to keep people of the street and turn them into Physical/Mental/Social Perfectionists, as being a established fighter within MMA is their dream . Tim Credeur (UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) Veteran and BJJ (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu) Black Belt) their coach renowned for starring on the Ultimate Fighter Season 7 is like a guide/father figure and to those training at Gladiatots Academy gym as he has seen the Sport of MMAs Ups and Downs. Beautiful Cinematography and Footage of Fights is not limited like similar documentaries Summing it up: Two Fighters, Two Personalities, One Coach, One Dream.",
         "I had just Watched DUSTIN POIRIER aka The Diamond vs CHAN SUNG JUNG aka The Korean Zombie .. Like a Week Before I seen FIGHTVILLE on Showtime So I Decided to Check it Out Because it was a Great Fight .. & I knew JUNG aka Korean Zombie was a Great Fighter & Warrior & Really The Only Asian Fighter I Liked But I Wanted to see more of POIRIER .. & I am Pretty sure he will be a FEATHERWEIGHT CHAMPION in THE UFC in The Next Two or so Years ... Homey been a Fighter since He Popped Out The VA-JAY-JAY .. Fighting for Real But for FUN as a Pre-Teen & Teenager Based on what his MOM said & Broke The Jaw of The OG of The Block who was 5 Years Older After he Beat ALL The other Kids his Age UP ... Because The OG said he hasn't fought him Yet (lol) Just Watched POIRIER vs BROOKINS 2 Nights ago & Dustin took a few Good Shots then Crumbled BROOKINS with his Own Shots & Than DARCE CHOKED him While he was on The Ground .. Dustin has a Good/Great Chin & he Fights to Finish aka Not a Safety First or Points Fighter aka The Most Entertaining Type of Fighter & in My Top 10 Favorite Fighters already .. The other Fighter ALBERT STAINBACK seemed Tough but he was Not Just about Fighting & The Competition .. He was about The Show aka A CLOCKWORK ORANGE Walk Out OUTFIT & Theme Song & The Attention & Adrenaline Rush .. He hasn't Fought since JUNE 2010 Based off of SHERDOG so I don't know what he is up to .. I thought it was Awesome & Hilarious that DUSTIN .. KOD .. a Fighter with The Nickname .. \"The Sex Machine\" for his Last Fight of The Documentary (lol) He looked like a Good Fighter & Legit But Lame A/S/S Nick Names Always Bug Me .. If he is The Sex Machine .. Dustin made Sure MISSIONARY was The Only Sex Position he could Perform that Night ... PAUSE ... Also (lol) @ TIM CREDEUR saying .. \"Whats up MY BABY\" .. After Dustin slept The Sex Machine .. It Sounded Kinda Lame but he was PROUD of his Student or Fighter",
         "Fightville was such an excellent documentary and it gets you to see inside the life of a cage fighter. Cage fighters train day in and day out to be the best. The sport is not just a sport, but a way of life. They make unbelievable sacrifices that most people have a hard time doing. But in the end, when you have that win, it makes all the tears, sweat, beatings, and training all the more worth it. This movie did such a great job seeing the part of MMA that most people don't ever see. There's a lot more behind a pair of gloves and a clever nickname and more people need to realize this. This movie for sure gets a 10 out of 10.",
         "Yes, cheesy as it sounds, I DID feel the fight in Fightville. I will not tell you too much because you should see it for yourself, but I loved experiencing the up close access that this documentary shows. I love that the documentary is presented in the words of the families, the promoters and most of all the fighters. You can't help but feel the pain and sweet in this documentary. Pretty intense and very real. There was a bit of culture shock for me in this documentary too. I can't say I knew what a grind the sport is for those \"down in the trenches\" looking for a shot. You'll know what I mean when you watch it."

         "Yell out \"fight!\" on a street corner and a crowd will always come running--at once attracted and repelled by the violent spectacle of man acting on his most primal urge. The draw of two men fighting is as old as civilization itself, but as far back as Plato, the sport of fighting has been at odds with the notion of a civil society. Over the last decade, Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) has grown from a controversial no-holds-barred gladiatorial sideshow into a billion dollar phenomenon eclipsing boxing as the dominant combat sport in the world. But far from Las Vegas, in sweat-soaked gyms and low-rent arenas across America, the big lights are but a dream. Here, men fight to test their mettle, fortified with the mythic promise that an ordinary man can transform into a champion. FIGHTVILLE is about the art and sport of fighting: a microcosm of life, a physical manifestation of that other brutal contest called the American Dream, where men are not born, but built through self determination, hard work and faith. It may be a myth, but in FIGHTVILLE, that's what champions are made of.",
