         "Did you ever own a copy of Famous Monsters of the Silver Screen? My big brother had one, and I'd sneak into his room sometimes just to scare myself with the Lon Chaney Phantom picture. Did you start planning for Halloween in August, or make a movie involving an animated blob of clay, a ray-gun, or a pet lizard? I didn't, but I love this movie anyway. I really enjoy low-budget and high-budget fantasy and science fiction. There is so much creativity and enthusiasm behind these special-effects-challenged, cheesy old movies. Now translated into CGI, some seem too real for their own good (while admittedly, some characters, like Gollum and Kong, deserve Oscars for an amazing imitation of life). Using rare and hilarious footage, this film shows how many special effects greats started out with a lump of Plasticine and a dream. This is your chance to get a glimpse of it. America especially has become a nation of consumers. To steal a phrase from Wes \"Scoop\" Nisker, \"If you don't like the movies, go out and make one of your own.\" If you love the movies, why not do the same?",
         "Didn't know much about the personalities that had so much effect on the Sci-Fi industry. This entertaining and informative feature documentary reveals those behind the scenes people. The Sci-Fi Boys is pure fun and very charming. It hails the potency of childhood dreams. And those childhood dreams created a multi-billion dollar industry. I really enjoyed Peter Jackson's humble involvement. His pure childlike but bardic contribution pays great homage to the characters upon who's shoulders he successfully rides. From the pioneering beginnings of stop motion to the 35 million dollar budget of high tech CGI features, Sci-Fi Boys takes you through the process and the people( Spielberg, Harryhausen etc.) that are your guides through Sci-Fi fantastic cinema. I highly recommend it! Gregory Dogood",
         "I collected Famous Monsters back in the day and used to argue with my older brother that the magazine WAS, certainly worth the paper it was printed on. That being said I may be biased in my rating, The DVD brought back many great prepubescent memories that I had when I would watch and read about monster or science fiction films. Like hoping aliens or some kind of monster would do something, anything, so that the teacher would have to postpone the test! Really, the childlike knowledge,(does that make any sense), that I still have which now I suppose we call Optimism are certainly caused by my early exposure to the products these people were offering. Respect to the cast!",
         "\"The Sci-Fi Boys\" is a wonderful documentary that I enjoyed. However, I am sure that this film is one mostly of interest to the already initiated--folks who already love sci-fi and fantasy. Most others would find its free-form style and lack of a clear focus problematic--as well as the subject material itself. But for sci-fi/fantasy fans, it's great--sort of like sitting back and listening to various greats in the industry talk. While there are a few film clips here and there, it's just folks talking. In many ways, it's a lot like what you might hear if you go to a sci-fi/fantasy convention--and you listen to the various great panelists talk about their craft and recollections. You hear from the likes of Forrest Ackerman, Ray Harryhausen, Ray Bradbury, Leonard Maltin, Rick Baker and many, many more. Topics seem to flow freely--like a stream of consciousness--and include home-made movies, advances in graphics, the films of William Castle, \"Famous Monsters of Filmland\" magazine, and much more. It's odd, but for some reason the captions were all in Spanish--but the language spoken was English. My Spanish isn't terrible--so I could understand almost all the movie titles in Spanish--others might not be so fortunate. There were a few mistakes or omissions. First, when discussing the films of Ed Wood, Jr., John Landis mentions \"Robot Monster\"--a terrible film but one NOT made by Wood. Also, it's odd that the film would talk so much about the stop-motion work of Willis O'Brien and Ray Harryhausen as well as Fritz Lang's \"Metropolis\"--but also not discuss the great early films of Georges Méliès. Méliès not only did a lot of early fantasy, but his \"Voyage to the Moon\" is probably the first sci-fi film. Only George Lucas mentioned his name--and nothing more was said of this great filmmaker. Overall, while the film looks a bit cheap and a few omissions (mentioned above), it's a great look at the industry and is a rare opportunity to hear from a diverse group of great men. And, now that I think about it, no women were interviewed for the documentary. Maybe that's saying something...",
         "The Correct name of that periodical was \"Famous Monsters of Filmland.\" Much like the movie makers in this documentary, I too (genuinely) looked forward to each monthly issue. This documentary is an oral history enhanced with \"out takes\" galore. Half a century later I can still recall some of the great photos spreads that lied within. I can recall the actual smell of those slim glossy 8.5\" x 11\" magazines. I used to roll up the current issue and carry it about half-stuffed in my back pocket when they were still new. That was the essence of hipness as a pre-pubescent adolescent. That was in the 1950's. Aaargh ! Now you know that I am a grizzled old codger. The older that one grows the greater the cachet memories have. More than you youngsters can imagine. Seeing this flick was a quasi- divine experience as I could relate to it so deeply. I recorded it via TIVO natch'",
         "Boy, this one brought back the memories. I was one of those kids who grew up collecting FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND and watching Shock Theater (in our area, hosted by \"The Bowman Body\") around Midnight on Friday or Saturday nights. I read THE MONSTER TIMES and MONSTERS AND HEROES (which often featured the amateur filmmaking efforts of a kid named Don Glut) and ran home every Monday through Friday to see DARK SHADOWS. When I could finally afford a car (which usually turned out to be a lemon), I spent my weekends at the drive-in (usually watching a horror double feature; rarely anything that WASN'T horror or science fiction). THE SCI-FI BOYS brought it all back. For that, I can only say THANK YOU ALL."
