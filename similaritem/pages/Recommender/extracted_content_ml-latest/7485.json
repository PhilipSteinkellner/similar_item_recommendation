      "synopsis": "Minoru (Koji Shitara) and Isamu (Masahiko Shimazu) are two siblings. They are constantly visiting their neighbour's home to watch TV. The last straw takes place when their mother forbids them to go there with their friend to watch a sumo game finals. The children go to Heiichiro Fukui (Keiji Sada) an unemployed English teacher, for English tutoring. Arita Setsuko (Yoshiko Kuga), their young aunt, offers some extra work for him doing translations. Also, their mothers are a bit stressed: the money for their quotas and rent seem to have disappeared. After much ado, a lot of hassle and everybody suspecting everybody of being a thief, the money appears in a brown envelope. Kikue Haraguchi (Haruko Sigimura) is thought to have kept the money to buy a washing machine. Although some of the neighbours don't want to believe it, because she's paying for it in instalments, others think it's a clear proof of her guilt. Mrs Okubo (Toyo Takahashi) is the one gossiping about everybody. Grandma Haraguchi (Eiko Miyoshi) received the envelope without acknowledging what it was and left it aside among the library books. Mother and daughter have a little row about grandma's memory, although she's just scared off a door-to-door salesman, because her daughter feels terrified by them. Minoru has a quarrel with his father, who accuses him of talking too much. The father feels old, and had a bar conversation with a drunk neighbour Yoshikazu Ookubo, aka Zen (Masuo Fujiki) who has left him feeling lonely and depressed. Minoru and Isamu decide to start a strike of their own to get the longed-for TV set: they will stop talking altogether, both at home and school. Because of that, they stop eating altogether, and they can't even bite a bit of Arita's delicious dessert. They don't even ask their parents for their tea money to eat at school, so one of the teachers has pity on them and buys them something. Finally, the father decides to buy a TV set, paying in several months. He is the first person who buys something from Zen, who has left retirement to start working as a door-to-door salesman as well. The children can talk again freely. Tamiko and Heiichiro are clearly in love, but neither of them seems to be able to throw the question. Heiichiro is strongly advised to do it, but the film ends with him make senseless chit-chat with Tamiko about the weather.",

         "\"Good Morning,\" is one of my favorite's films. It means a lot to me personally, because -like all of Ozu's work- it demonstrates a brilliant understanding of the complexities of being human. It contains simple wisdom, humour, and kindness; and sadly the whole of cinema history has provided us with very few films which can make such a claim. Ozu celebrates the beauty of middle-class existence, all the while delivering a profound criticism of our tendency to permit \"small talk\" to dominate conversations. Ultimately though, it is the humour which makes \"Good Morning\" my favorite's Ozu picture, for it is a very funny movie. Very funny and very satisfying! I can hardly imagine an open-minded person not enjoying it. Because many North American viewers have a reluctance to watch films more than a few years old, or in languages other than English, Ozu's exposure here is still extremely limited. That is unfortunate because Ozu's films are quite universal. I feel confident that anyone could appreciate Ozu's genius in this film.",
         "In a small community of workers in Japan, two brothers decide to not speak because they want to force their parents to buy a television. With this single storyline, Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu exposes a delightful and critical view of the behavior of the Japanese working class under the American influence in the post-WWII. Once again the major concern of Ozu is with the family and human relationship. The situation of the retired people is magnificently pictured through the desperate men looking for a job; the domination of the USA in Japan is represented through the need of private English classes for the two brothers, and the translation of documents to English; superfluous consume of the American society is represented through the importance of the useless television for the younger generation, while their parents are concerned with have some savings for their retirement. The destructive little gossips, the difficulties of communication, and many other problems of relationship are also shown in this little gem. For movie lovers like me, I regret to inform that this is the first DVD of the great director released in Brazil. Only in festivals, and occasionally in cable television, Brazilians have the chance to see the work of this great director. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): \"Bom Dia\" (\"Good Morning\")",
         "For viewers who have seen only one or two of Ozu's statelier films -- say, \"Tokyo Story\" or \"Equinox Flower\" -- \"Good Morning\" will be a surprise. Two children take a vow of silence to coerce their parents into buying a television set: that's pretty much the whole plot. But what happens as a result affects almost every aspect of life in the nondescript, gossipy, elbow-to-elbow suburb in which the boys' family lives. This is a comedy, and like all good comedies it's very serious. The boys' act of rebellion is very un-Japanese, and it threatens many of the politely ritualistic social behaviors that mask and deflect the tensions in Japanese society. Whole alliances among the village's women teeter and threaten to topple. The family's authority structure is upended, with the all-powerful father crumbling against the stubborn silence of two little boys. What wins in the end is love -- or rather (Ozu must have found this particularly funny) love and television. The resolution will probably tear you up (it has brought moisture to the eyes of everyone I've seen it with) but it represents enormous changes in Japanese society -- the collapse of patriarchal authority, the invasion of foreign culture, and especially English-language culture, and the inexorable rise of that great leveler of aesthetics, television. Ozu saw the future, and he wasn't in it. So naturally, he presents all this in a gentle, even sweet-natured comedy. There may be greater Ozu films, but it's hard to think of one I actually like more than \"Good Morning.\"",
         "This movie is sometimes called a remake of Ozu's silent I Was Born, But..., however, for an artist that would repeat and retread various themes and story-elements throughout his work, \u0091remake' is a big word. Both I Was Born and Ohayo contain a strike by two boys against their parents, but that's about the only thing they have in common. It's much more interesting to look at the differences: In I Was Born, But... the kids go on a hunger-strike after seeing their father humiliate himself in front of his boss. The strike is therefore one for such old-school values as honor and dignity. No such lofty goals in Ohayo, here the object of the strike is that ultimate symbol of western consumerism, the television. One could conclude that in this change lies Ozu's criticism, that he is bemoaning how traditional Japanese values are being exchanged for materialism. That, however, would be far too simple. In I Was Born But,... the kids had to compromise, in Ohayo it's the parents who compromise. The kids in Ohayo get their television, the kids in I Was Born But,... had to learn that for their father, supporting his family is more important than upholding samurai-ideals. Neither movie is a criticism on, but a clear-eyed portrait of a changing society. The main theme in Ohayo is communication. The kids want a television, the parents don't and in an argument one of the boys remarks how adults talk a lot but never say anything important. Consequently, the kids refuse to talk until they get their tv. Chaos and comedy ensues and meanwhile Ozu and Noda incorporate some sharp observations in their script on our inability to communicate meaningfully with each other. The scene in which two people who have an inexpressed love for each other talk about the weather is as funny as it is tragic. And I almost forgot to mention: Ohayo contains some of the funniest fart-jokes in any movie. ***1/2",
         "While somewhat lighter than most of Ozu's features, this is still a rather perceptive film that is also entertaining to watch. The situation and the characters are all straightforward, yet Ozu's expert eye sees plenty of things worth considering, and each simple story development has a purpose. If the material remains generally lightweight when compared to some of his other movies, it still has the same thoughtful, low-key touch and genuinely human characters. The young boys drive much of the story in this one, and they are very believable, whether in their petulant responses to parental authority or in their schoolboy fads. Some of the latter can be slightly off-putting at times, but then such things do rather ring true with the nature of boys at that stage of their lives. The cast is quite large, so that none of the characters gets a lot more screen time than any of the others, yet somehow all of them not only come alive, but get some defining moments. Most of the adult characters are simple, yet easy to care about, and there are several good performances. The grandmother character and the aunt of the two brothers are probably the most interesting of the characters, yet all of them have a purpose. As is usually the case with Ozu's movies, you can watch it a second time and see additional detail in the characters' relationships and dialogue. This time, the issues involved are not as significant as usual, yet the simple plot provides some insights into the ways that families and neighbors communicate with one another and understand one another. It's probably more entertaining than enlightening, but yet there is some substance as well.",
         "Although I appreciate Ozu's film style & quality, I've never been a big fan due to the generally melodramatic themes of his movies. OHAYO is quite different. The multiple comic themes range from fart jokes & clueless gossiping neighbors to fears of obsolescence in a rapidly changing society. Particularly prescient is the early awareness of the Baka (idiot) power of television. In Japan it has been common for decades to have TV sets mounted in temples & shrines so that the Kami (spirits) can watch. We in the U.S. have long been \"a nation of 100 million idiots\" (and then some) from our obsession with constant entertainment especially in the form of TV. Our children whine & act petulant unless they have their own TV & DVDs in their rooms & even when riding in the car. In many homes the TV is constantly on, regardless of what might be happening either on the boob-tube or outside (such as visitors calling). Ozu saw it coming almost half a century ago.",
         "Last year NHK (national broadcaster in Japan) were playing 2 Ozu movies a night and I tuned into this by accident. Maybe because I have lived in Japan for 10 years and was watching it in it's native language and could understand the subtle nuances in the day-to-day conversation, or maybe simply because I related to the children, having grown up in a household where getting things that you actually want was very rare - quite simply, this movie moved me tremendously, the final scene brought tears to my eyes just *remembering* it a week later. This movie is probably most effective for anybody who grew up in a poor household with parents who tried their best against all odds to keep their children happy.",
         "\"Good Morning\" (Japanese, 1959): Directed by Ozu. As in all of his films, Tokyo is the stage, and he populates them with his usual team of actors. Think of the professional stability of Ingmar Bergman, Woody Allen, or John Waters, but Japanese. Ozu concentrates on small moments made meaningful. Unlike the quiet, black and white drama \"Tokyo Story\", this later film (in color) is a gentle comedy about how people build the character of each and every day with the smallest of gestures \u0096 which is this case is brought to our attention by two small brothers who decide to go \"on strike\" insisting that their Father get a television for the household. It's a loving, funny, and forgiving look at how silly we all can be.",
         "It may have the skimpiest of plots--two young brothers take a vow of silence until their parents buy them a television--but Yasujiro Ozu's 1959 picture is anything but slight, taking on the subject of language (ironic, considering the story) with attentiveness and intelligence. In his deliberate, contemplative manner, Ozu presents a wry commentary on the ways even the most innocuous words can harm (gossip) or become the building blocks of a relationship (a budding romance is confirmed by a conversation about the weather); he also notes Japan's growing fascination with the English language (the older boy studies it) and the increasing obsession, now with fourteen years of distance from the war, with American technology--the suburban landscape is peppered with aerial antennas as television begins to permeate the culture. It's subtly beautiful: each shot is perfectly framed (the camera never moves) with an excellent use of depth that highlights exactly what the director wants you to see and giving you plenty of space to focus; it's easy to see how a master of today's Asian cinema such as Wong Kar-Wai would be profoundly influenced by Ozu's languid yet carefully observed filmmaking. A delight; it's also a fine introduction for younger viewers to the magnificence of international cinema.",
         "Ozu's films always balance humour, heartbreak and social comment - in this film the balance is decidedly in favour of humour. Its hard to imagine a slighter story to build a full movie - two little boys who decide not to speak for a few days in a huff over being denied a TV. But Ozu builds a whole world out of this dull little suburb in a Japan just getting on its feet after the war and embracing consumerism as an alternative to..... well, whatever went before. I think only Ozu could make boring mass produced housing look so utterly gorgeous in full colour, and the minor bickering of the household ladies seem so important. He's helped by a fantastic cast, especially the child actors playing the little boys (oddly enough, there doesn't seem to be any little girls in this suburb). The story has layer up layer of irony (aided by numerous fart jokes) built up upon its slight foundations making an utterly fascinating film. As usual with Ozu, he doesn't lecture, although as always his sympathy is slightly tilted to the somewhat bemused father figures. Even the simple ending, a shot of laundry fluttering on a line, seems somehow laden with meaning. The whole film is a pure delight."

         "This movie takes a look at a very Westernized subarban Japan in the late 50's. It focuses mainly on the daily lives of a small community and the way its members interact. It also demonstrates the power of speech and the way in which small talk acts as a lubricant for our daily lives.",
         "Adolescent brothers Minoru and Isamu Hayashi live with their parents and aunt in a suburban housing complex on the outskirts of Tokyo. Because of the close quarters within the housing complex, all the neighbors get along well, although gossip does spread quickly amongst the housewives and amongst the men at the bar. Because of the friendly nature of the neighbors, Minoru, Isamu and their two friends, Kôzô and Zennosuke, who also live in the complex, will often go over to one neighbor's house, they who have the only television set in the complex. Despite the boys insistence they get one for their own house, Mr. and Mrs. Hayashi refuse to buy a television, due to the cost and believing it to be the downfall of Japanese society. In an argument with the boys over the issue, Mr. Hayashi accuses the boys of making too much noise while having their tantrum. The boys, in return and in protest, decide to go a \"silence\" strike, not only against their parents, but also any adult including their aunt, their neighbors and their teachers. This silent treatment causes many misunderstandings, especially among the housewives about some missing money. Will the boys get their way and if so will it be because of their protest? Regardless of the outcome, the process of dealing with the boys assists in drawing two of the adults in the complex together.",
