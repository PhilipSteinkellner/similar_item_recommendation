      "reviews": [
         "This lovely, little-known MGM musical from 1951 stands above most others of its genre by utilizing a strong, often (unintentionally) disturbing and moving storyline as a background for its delightful musical numbers and melodic score. Jane Powell is fresh as the first day of spring, and in fine voice. Vic Damone's equally engaging as her romantic interest. But the real surprise is the depth and vivacity of the \"adult\" performers -- Wendell Corey, Fernando Lamas (whose resonant baritone voice is fully utilized) and the delicious Danielle Darrieux in one of her few American movies. She provides charm, elegance and alluring sex-appeal as a woman who abandoned her daughter (Powell) shortly after her birth, divorced her husband (Corey), returned to her native France, and resumed her career as a Parisian nightclub performer, currently in love with her cabaret co-star Lamas. Corey unwittingly takes his daughter to Paris for a vacation, having no idea she will eventually discover the identity of her supposedly \"deceased\" mother. The sad undercurrents of the plot are glossed over by a lush Technicolored production and one riveting song after another. The riveting finale is staged and photographed and sung to vivid perfection. A delicious diversion, with a glorious cast doing full justice to its entrancing score and poignant screenplay. Simply a pity that the delectable, saucy Ms. Darrieux was never teamed with Fred Astaire, though Ms. Powell was one year later in the knockout \"Royal Wedding\".",
         "One of Jane Powell's best musicals for MGM is Rich, Young and Pretty and Ms. Powell winds up all three and married to boot. She and father Wendell Corey and housekeeper Una Merkel are in Paris where Wendell is on business for the United Nations where he works. But he wasn't always a high powered diplomat. After the first World War he took a French bride, Danielle Darrieux, back to Texas. Texas didn't agree with Danielle and she left Wendell and her infant daughter. Wendell has told Jane her mother had passed away. Of course all this deception by Corey leaves room for more deception by Danielle upon Jane's arrival in Paris. With a little subterfuge Darrieux and Powell meet. And Powell's also got eyes for a young French official, Vic Damone and she's forgetting about the boy she's seeing back home. The story line of Rich, Young, and Pretty gets a little too cute, but there are some talented players here to smooth out the rough spots. And Nicholas Brodzsky and Sammy Cahn wrote some nice songs. One of them, Wonder Why, was nominated for Best Song, but lost to In the Cool Cool Cool of the Evening. Still Wonder Why is a very pretty ballad, sung by both Damone and Powell. My favorite song however is Paris, a city that certainly has inspired some of our best songwriters. Here it's done by Fernando Lamas and sung well. Fans of this talented cast will want to see their stars perform even though the story is a bit silly.",
         "Jane Powell sparkles as Texas gal Elizabeth Rogers who travels to Europe with her single father and finds romance with a young man--and also meets the mother she never knew. MGM musical on a less-than-grand scale, yet underrated Powell really pours on the charm and her song numbers are fairly witty. The picture is a bit encumbered by the studio's restrictions--there are hardly any scenes set outdoors, and the shots of Paris are obviously fillers from MGM's stock--but the cast (including Una Merkel, Fernando Lamas and Wendell Corey) is colorful and the screenplay (worked on by Sidney Sheldon) is lively and fun. **1/2 from ****",
         "This is a good example of the romantic/musical/comedy light movies that came out in the 1950's and the 1960's. It's in color, with an excellent cast, some good music, a typical love story, and light comedy. It was the introductory film for Vic Damone, with excellent singing by him, Jane Powell, Fernando Lamas, Danielle Darrieux (a singer/actress whom I was not familiar with), and The Four Freshmen. With those outstanding singers, I cannot understand why the director of the movie had Wendell Corey sing two songs, when he couldn't sing worth a hoot. Perhaps it was meant to be a humorous contrast for the other singers, but I can imagine that Mr. Corey was embarrassed by having to do so. This is a good light-weight comedy that I will watch again.",
         "For being an MGM musical, \"Rich, Young, and Pretty\", has a strange look to it. Gone are the glossy backgrounds, those fabulous costumes, and great songs that were the trade mark of anything that came out of the studio. Yet, the film with its silly plot and predictable situations, is not a total failure. Thanks to Norman Taurog's direction, there are some good things to be found in the picture. It helps to explain Jane Powell, one of the most radiant musical stars of the era, was pregnant at the time this film went into production. It also explains why Ms. Powell, who had a beautiful figure, was dressed in the unflattering costumes like the one blue number she wears the first night she goes to La Parisienne with Andre Milan. To make matters worse, her blue dress is complimented with some sort of Dutch cap that makes this girl from Texas look she is Amish! The film is made better because of the presence of Danielle Darrieux, one of the best actresses from France and who could have had a great career in Hollywood, if it weren't for the way she hated the way movies were made here. Ms. Darrieux plays Marie Devarone, the star of the exclusive night club. Danielle Darrieux's Marie shows an exquisite woman who knew a thing, or two, about how to charm an audience, be it in the night club, or otherwise. The supporting cast is not bad. Vic Damone made his debut in the movies here. Wendell Corey, Una Merkel, Marcel Dalio, and the rest do what they can with the material they were given to play. The film is harmless enough and the allure of Jane Powell and Danielle Darrieux in the same movie is enough for making us watch it.",
         "Something about the city of lights had American cinema going ooh la LA in the early 1950's. Whether it was the presence of American artists remaining abroad after the war was over in \"An American in Paris\" or trips to the \"Moulin Rouge\", as well as this MGM musical that is refreshed by the presence of the lovely Jane Powell who sparkles when she sings and still gives me goose bumps. It's a slight story of Texas rancher Wendell Corey returning to Paris on business with daughter Powell and secretary Una Merkel and running into his ex-wife Danielle Darrieux whom Powell is unaware of the fact that she is her mother. She has her own romantic complications (with singer Vic Damone) and along the way gets to sing the pretty \"Paris\" as well as a jazzed up \"Deep in the Heart of Texas\" (partly in French). It is Wendell Corey who goes for laughs, having been very staid and dull in melodramas opposite Stanwyck and Crawford. His attempts to be a comic seem forced, and at times, he seems almost embarrassed. The comedy and music are overshadowed by the fact that Powell is unaware that her mother is still alive, giving a twist to the usual perfect family set-up that Louis B. Mayer's MGM usually presented. Darriueux didn't make much of an impact being back in films in Hollywood after a decade's absence, although she certainly is lovely to look at. If Fernando Lamas obviously isn't French, that's a small complaint. Still, it's another romantic view of Paris that probably wasn't nearly as well put back together after the war, but cest la vie!",
         "No need to recap the plot, which at the beginning resembles that of Giant (1956). Musicals generally live or die by the quality of the music. By that standard, this one is pretty much a snoozer following a string of forgettably bland numbers, which at least don't annoy. The movie itself stands as a clear instance of lead performers outshining the material� mainly, the always sparkling Jane Powell and a fabulous Danielle Darrieux. Even the seemingly miscast Corey, so usually dour, manages an agreeable father. While in a tacked-on role, a hunky Fernando Lamas is clearly on his way up. One can sympathize, however, with boyish crooner Damone in his first film-- his self-consciousness almost flies off the screen. I expect critics are right about the problems caused by Powell's pregnancy. The production has a less polished, more constrained look than the usual high MGM standard. This could well be due to a hurry-up schedule and Powell's growing girth. Whatever the reason, the movie's a chance to catch the ravishing French actress Darrieux in one of her few American roles. Otherwise, it's pretty forgettable.",
         "This is a nice musical brought to us by MGM. Jane Powell plays the daughter of Wendell Corey. Wendell has been divorced for years. His wife could not handle living in Texas. Wendell takes Jane to Paris on business and Jane falls quickly in love with Vic Damone. She would work with Vic in three other films. He played her love interest in Hit the Deck, played her partner in the cameo they had in Deep in my Heart & he played Debbie Reynolds love interest in Athena with Jane. The best song of this film happens early on when Wendell and Jane sing Deep in the heart of Texas. Back to the story. Jane's mother spots her in Paris. She is now in love with Fernando Lamas. She sets up a meet with Jane and does not tell her she is her mother. Wendell finds out and wants to leave. Jane has a fallout with Vic and talks with her mother before she leaves. She sets up the two so they can get back together. She also lets Jane know she is her mother by talking to her father in the next room. Neither one of them admit they know. Her father hints he will tell her after the final song of the movie. Enjoyable movie with a good run time of one hour and thirty five minutes.",
         "Firstly, I had seen Miss Darieux in several movies. In this one, not even a trace of a French accent - amazing. Also, enjoyed Lamas, an Argentinian with a what-kind-of accent. By the way, whatever happened to his heart-throb son? Back to \"Rich, Young and Pretty,\" I say pooh - double pooh - or poohpooh to the naysayers who dissected this movie and found fault with the performers and/or the script. The songs were good, but certainly not MGM's best. The happiest surprise was \"Deep In the Heart of Texas\" - what a joy, and the song involving the great Four Freshmen. The ballads were fairly decent - nothing more, nothing less. As for the fellow with the cane and cigar box who does not like Jane Powell - to quote Gen. McAuliffe when asked about surrendering to Germany - NUTS! I don't know if she was pretty or cute, so I settle for pretty cute. Her voice, not quite as strong as Kathryn Grayson, is still quite beautiful. One of that era's best singers was Vic Damone who could sing powerfully, or pleasantly. I enjoyed him. I loved the ending with its flying saucers - and knives, forks, spoons, and French cuisine. Yes, I enjoyed the movie, and I'm proud to admit it. Onward and upward.",
         "RICH, YOUNG AND PRETTY is a perfect example of how not to film a musical. First of all, the script is a shambles, even if Sidney Sheldon did have a hand in it. The story is trite from beginning to end, Jane Powell's voice is completely wasted with forgettable songs, and I kept thinking how this was the sort of plot featured in so many Deanna Durbin films--but done with more skill and polish for Durbin. As bad as the film is, there are a couple of compensations. First, Danielle Darrieux is charming and skillful in her role as Jane's mother, even tossing off a few songs in a professional manner. Her song partner, Fernando Lamas, has a rather thankless role but reveals a fine baritone voice for a couple of uninspired songs. Wendell Corey sports a mustache and seems to be filling in for Walter Pidgeon, as someone else suggested. Nevertheless, his is a pleasantly foolish role and he plays it with style, even when forced to warble off key in a silly nightclub number. For Jane Powell's fans, there is nothing distinctive about the songs she's given to sing. In fact, all of the best numbers are delivered by Danielle Darrieux who does well by them. The whole plot is so irritatingly simple-minded, with Vic Damone giving his worst performance ever in a romantic leading role and never bothering to sound the least bit like the Frenchman he's supposed to be. Jane is a rich girl who doesn't find out until the film's last moments that Darrieux is the mother who deserted her father way back when. And naturally, in time for the last clinch, Jane's father decides it's okay for her to marry the Frenchman (Damone). The artificial MGM settings are rigged to make us believe we're in Paris, but even that doesn't work. For an MGM musical of the '50s, this one is the pits. It's really a B-film wrapped up in A-film status but not making the grade."
