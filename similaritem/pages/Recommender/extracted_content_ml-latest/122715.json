         "This movie really is not a view of life in boarding schools, per se. I don't believe it was intended to be. It is a metaphor for the effects still felt today by nearly all Native Americans here in the U.S. The movie \"is\" a period place. All of the issues that the story touches base on are those that Natives all over Indian Country are dealing with today. It is not the direct reflection of one single reason why Natives today face the afflictions of poverty, alcoholism, abuse, unemployment, illiteracy, and loss of identity as a culture, but the culmination of many. Forced attendance into an institution specifically designed to strip away everything it means to be \"Indian\" just so happens to be the primary area of focus in this film. The sub-plots add depth to the characters as well as much needed comic relief. Even though this film is classified as a drama, it should be shown in every history class across the United States, right after the lesson on the first \"Thanksgiving\".",
         "I saw this movie because it was rated 9.5 at this site on April 9, 2010. Minutes into the film, I could tell that this was rating was due only to the subject matter and not the quality of the film itself. The script and acting are mediocre to poor, and the story is predictable from start to finish. If you don't know Native American history, this film should be an eye-opener. If you do, as I did before watching the movie, you will be pleased to see that this important aspect of Native American history was made into a movie. If only it had been made into a movie worth seeing. I could see that everyone involved with the making of the film tried their best, but it didn't work. Very disappointed. 9.5? No, it's just a 5.",
         "The story of American Indian boarding schools needs to be told. In the past Indian children were taken from their parents, often forcibly, and put into highly-regimented schools designed to eradicate all signs of their \"savagery.\" Use of Indian languages in these schools was forbidden and harshly punished. This movie probably should have been a \"period place\" showing the experiences of an Indian child thrust into the soul-killing world of the boarding school. Perhaps it was feared this approach would limit the size of the audience. In any case we get a modern-day story, set in northern Minnesota, in which a boarding school is glimpsed only occasionally in brief flashbacks. Surrounding these flashbacks lies a plot cluttered with a bewildering number of elements: the arrogance of the Catholic Church, shock treatments, commercial development of sacred Indian lands, an election for mayor pitting a white man against a red man, gambling casinos, a love story, hallucinations and visions, family secrets leading to tensions, a bizarre crucifixion-style murder, etc. There's even a subplot involving a geologist investigating earthquakes! All this clutter is unnecessary and self-defeating because the story which the movie wants to tell is strong enough as it is. It doesn't need to be \"packaged\" with elements which tend to detract from it rather than enhance it.",
         "This film is very powerful since it delves into all the horrific traumas that Native kids went through at boarding schools everywhere in the States, not just in Minnesota. This one should take the blinders off of every white person who thinks that Indians \"have always had it easy\" or \"good\"!! Viewers of this film should realize the horror of these death camps that were disguised as \"boarding schools\"! Many children died at the hands of the priests, nuns and all the other school personnel. I strongly suggest watching this for anyone who dislikes Native people for their \"bad qualities\"; the ones who think that Natives are only \"one of society's many problems\". You'll know what I'm talking about after watching it. I hope the film will literally open your eyes and see the truth! That's why this film was released, to make the public aware of the atrocities that occurred. ANYWAYS...that's why I gave this a 9 out of 10.",
         "I was surprised by the negative reviews of this movie. I found it entrancing. It's a glimpse into a different culture, and a different way of thinking. I don't believe this is a ghost story, as much as a taste of a different world view. I loved the Original American sensibility that permeates the film-- from the slow, considering way of speaking, through the belief that visions are real, to the effort to show that the unspoken of the past must be brought to light for harmony to prevail. The actors are so believable. I ended up with empathy for everyone (and want to know more of their story-- hint hint) The movie caught the insular nature of a small, isolated community. Until you've spent a fair bit of time in one, you wouldn't believe the power that authority figures have. Unless you've been around Catholics or Protestants of the older generation, you wouldn't believe the power that a priest can have. Unfortunately, I've experienced both, and the aunt/priest/lock-up-the- truth-sayer scenario rang true to me. I think that the European American scientist character is supposed to be a device to represent a modern western view of the situation. It is a little raggedy, but that's OK because the story is so powerful on its own that the character is a non-interfering sidelight to the story. I look forward to watching more films by these writers and directors.",
         "Older than America is an educational movie about Native Americans and their experiences while attending boarding schools. It also addresses the trauma and difficulties that they still suffer today. The main character, Rain (Georgina Lightning), is reliving her mother's experiences and trying to make sense out of them. **Spoiler**** The storyline involves a Catholic priest, Father Bartoli, who wants to stop Rain from learning about what really went on at the boarding school. Farther Bartoli convinces Rain's Auntie Apple to consent to shock treatments for Rain. These treatments were given also to Rain's mother and are the reason why Rain's mother is now basically a mute. Rain eventually breaks out of the institution with her memory of what happened in tact. Some of the Native Americans who were sent to boarding schools still suffer the consequences today. Many of the children who were sent off to boarding schools were taken away from their parents and never learned parenting skills. The children had no role modeling of parents at the boarding schools. The only parental figures were teachers, nuns, and priest. Numerous Native Americans who attended boarding schools suffer from alcoholism and depression that often lead to suicide. This became a vicious cycle for younger generations to view. **Spoiler** The main trickster is Rain because when it is least expected she surprises the audience with another escape or a joke. Because of Rain we can see what a culture shock the boarding schools still have on Native Americans and their families. Another trickster is Walter Many Lightnings who is actually a spirit. Walter unstraps Rains when she is in the institution and allows her to escape. However, earlier in the movie, he would watch her, and it scared her. Another trickster is Father Bartoli; he tricks Rain's Auntie Apple into believing Rain is a schizophrenic like Apple's sister, Rain's mother. Father Bartoli convinces Auntie Apple the only way to help Rain is to do the electroshock treatments. I would most definitely recommend this movie. I truly believe it is part of our history and should be included in all of our history books. This would be a great movie for all history classes to view. My daughter and I loved this movie and think it is one of the best movies we have seen in a very long time. However, we both view the Catholic Church in a much different way than before.",
         "Government worker Luke Patterson (Bradley Cooper) goes to a small Native American reservation to find out about a mild earthquake there. He becomes friends with the Indian Chief of Police (Adam Beach) and finds an abandoned school building where the earthquake took place. It seems some very mysterious and horrifying events took place there years ago--but the church and some local officials are covering it up. But things are starting to happen and the building may be haunted by creepy dead children. **DEFINITE SPOILERS!** This is based on true events. It seems up until the early 70s, Indian children were taken from their parents and forced to attend a Catholic school. There they were told to speak English only and worship God. If they disobeyed they were punished severely. This works into the story and it's downright horrifying. I knew nothing about this and, it seems, it's STILL not talked about. Filmmaker Georgina Lightning was very brave to get funding for this and get it released. \"\"END SPOILERS** Totally engrossing. I was never bored for one minute. I saw it at a film festival and the audience got so caught up in it they were actually gasping and saying \"no\" when the villain went after the good guys. Cooper's (who's excellent) story gets sidetracked completely after the first 30 minutes. Then it throws you head first into a story involving murders, ghosts, child abuse (VERY disturbing), visions, electro shock treatments--this movie doesn't hold back. It is difficult to watch but I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Disturbing and difficult but always fascinating. A 10 all the way.",
         "I watched this going in with high hopes with Adam Beach and Bradley cooper. What i really got was a alright story made into a pretty poor movie. I was trying to figure out what Coopers part really had to do with the movie. Will bring in a Earthquake expert too take a look at an area where supposedly an earthquake took place. Adam Beach was alright but he looked bored playing his part like it was a paycheck probably because he knew this movie would get lost or go directly to DVD. Not only was this movie lost it didn't get released until 2012 over 5 years after it was made. Well this would be the moment to start releasing older Bradley Cooper movies after his Hangover flicks. I have to be honest the lead female role in this movie was hard to look at and her acting was not much better. This tries to be a superstitious ghost type movie and turns into an unbelievable movie with zero suspense. Its amazing how 1 priest can try to cover up such a big mess you would think he would have help and he all by himself had that much power to keep it hidden. They turned a based on a true story into a suspense movie where only the past was the truth everything else was LIFETIME for TV. Bradley probably wishes he didn't except the part!",
         "Good cast, but not so well done as a movie. I love Adam Beach and Wes Studi, and was surprised to see Bradley Cooper. I watched the movie online and thought I had some issues with loading, but perhaps it was just poor shooting/direction. I didn't care for lack of resolution regarding one government man. However, I appreciated the story and the history. Personally, I am working with the Navajo and love to learn about native culture. (This movie reservation was in Minnesota). I have heard testimony of some of this boarding school history. This movie was disturbing, with disturbing images and concepts, but I believe that much was based on truth. I wouldn't recommend this for young kids, but would love for older youth to learn about this native history.",
         "Lets get this out of the way, the movie was just OK. But the story, the history... congratulations to Lightning for helping get this story out. I read many comments about \"boarding schools\" and \"1970s\" and the \"US.\" It's important to note that Lightning is Canadian. The truth behind the fictional story presented here is very much Canadian. As is always the case, it was a Canadian story set in the US to sell it better (see ARGO). The residential school system existed until 1996! Alberta, where Lightning hails from, had the greatest concentration of these institutions. The Residential School system is widely referred to as \"Canada's Holocaust\" due to the cultural genocide perpetrated against First Nations people by various Church organizations and the Canadian government. So again, congratulations Lightning for helping to raise awareness for this important subject. Too bad the truth is so buried below a sub par fictional story and an unnecessary Americanization of Canadian history.",
         "The first time I've ever written a review, but I felt compelled to warn others. Not since I watched Werewolves versus Vikings have I seen a film so poorly written with a multitude of clichés and very questionable acting. The subject matter may be serious at heart but it is cosseted in a third rate ghost story with elements that are not only implausible but also insulting to the audience. It truly has failed as a film because it belittles the subject matter it was trying to highlight. I watched this on demand and it's the first time in a long time that I haven't been able to watch something right to the end. I assume that other reviewers have given it higher ratings out of respect for the background message of the film, but that really can't excuse or compensate for the fact that this simply is a poor film.",
         "This is the clearest and most direct version of the abuses that boarding schools perpetrated against Native Americans in the United States and Canada. I disagree strongly with those who claim the film is inaccurate. In fact, the rapes, physical abuse, and neglect leading to murder of children are accurate according to the records boarding school survivors recount. Most films which depict Native American struggles fear to \"go there,\" to truly face the more hideous abuses that Native American children continued to endure until mere decades ago. The passing of the Indian Child Welfare Act in 1978 finally ended this pattern of kidnapping and horrifying deprivation, but the legacy lives on. Georgina Lightning did a fantastic, masterful job directing and writing this film. She has created a heartbreaking testament to the spirit of survival which many Native American women over the years have embodied. The film furthermore links racist abuse with cultural genocide and the manner in which white doctors turned trauma into a pathology. Women of Color have been diagnosed as mentally ill and institutionalized historically for reasons similar to the protagonist in this film. Few films truly reflect this reality. In other words, this is a brave, cutting-edge look at a tragic portion of U.S. history whose legacy continues today.",
         "This film tells the story of a native American woman who discovers that her schizophrenic mother is actually a victim of a scheme of widespread abuse, torture and a massive cover up at an institutional level. Even after reading the synopsis of the plot, I was still unprepared for the atrocities portrayed in the film. I have little knowledge in native American history, and the events portrayed truly shocks me. I'm sadly reminded of a similar film but set in a different country, \"Rabbit Proof Fence\". I'm glad to see justice is portrayed, and healing occurs. The plot itself is quite good, it's engaging because it mixes romance with drama and supernatural elements. I enjoyed it. Bradley Cooper's character is a bit redundant and out of place with the plot. It feels as if his character is added to the plot after the plot is written. Anyway, despite the apparently low budget, \" Older Than America \" is a good film and deserves to be watched.",
         "Visually, it was okay. Editing was good. The main story I understood. It was about \"Rain\" having these nightmares about her mom's boarding school. A priest who put her mom in a mental facility, wants to do the same to Rain. Why? because of the atrocities priest & nuns did to Native kids at the school many years ago. I got lost & confused & had questions, many questions. What is Bradley Cooper doing in this film? Why did a Native kill a white government worker? Why?! Was Adam Beach a real police officer or just an idiot? He was accepted into the FBI academy but didn't know Law or how to investigate? Rain was in a car accident & John said she had a bump on her head. Where was it? My list of questions go on..., Georgina Lightning wrote, directed & starred in this. A feat in itself. I hear she won all these Indie awards. For what? My questions continue...,",
         "What can I say? As an African-American the experience of the Indian-American is an exercise in parallels in many ways. Still, 1975 America is like Australia for the aborigine and the Maori of New Zealand. So much horror has been done in the name of the Christian God that it begs the question why any non-European wears the cross. This was less a movie than an historical journey into the time when all aboriginal people worldwide were subjected to the death of their cultures to save the savage men, women and children by the most unforgiving and brutal heathens calling themselves called to do the work of god. How can one have an identity when the spirit is broken and the psyche is fractured? This is an abject lesson for humanity founded on the religious principle that debt is the best slavery and the seeking of everlasting forgiveness of those debts keeps strong the invisible chains of bondage. Know thyself must mean more than what the European wants you to know about your ancestry. For the people who thought the acting was not so good well somethings are better left for historic value and not subjected to Hollywood's version as in \"Dancing With Wolves,\" although I loved Two Socks!",
         "I vote low average for a less than average movie. But, I am very very suspicious of those reviewers above who give it a 9 or 10 and call it \"the best movie I've ever seen\" or \"should be part of school history lessons.\" This is really the best movie you've ever seen? You were brought up Amish perhaps and this is therefore the first movie you've ever seen? And you honestly think this is a historical document, it's so factual and real? Come on people, stop ad agencies posting crap on our IMDb. People use our ratings to choose the movies they see, so professionals are muscling in to push up the numbers and try and boost ticket sales for crap movies. So, a sudden outburst of 9's and 10's, or a whole host of !!!! exclamation marks trying to catch your attention, or anything that is so over the top or gooey, cheek-sucking sweet - then push the numbers back down again by voting low!!!! Make it unprofitable to fake reviews.",
         "At first I thought it was the acting that was spoiling this well written film, then I actually realised that it was the shockingly bad direction. The camera angles and shots are actually worse than a bad Australian soap opera and make the interaction between the characters much poorer than it actually is. Again, this is a decently written plot with an important message behind it. However, the director and whoever actually gave this film to her should be completely ashamed of themselves. She has made this into a B movie due to her lack of understanding of basic shot, lighting and angle. In fact all elements of mise-en-scene. I have never seen a plot and actors destroyed so completely by a director. Completely disgraceful. A frustrating and unbelievable watch.",
         "I can hardly express my disappointment in this film. A premise with lots of potential was utterly wasted by a plot line that was both underdeveloped and meandering, soapy dialog and acting that was....just awful. Worse yet, though, was the inescapable feeling that the director was trying to grind an ax. I won't go into details because I don't wish to enter spoiler territory, but it was pretty obvious that this film was less about a story than it was an agenda. The cheap, unbalanced potshots at all-too-easy targets were tiresome and trite over a decade ago; in a contemporary film, they were just plain sad. In the end, I felt angry, but not at the film's intended targets. This film would have been a waste of money had I not seen it on Netflix, but it was still a waste of time. Nothing much to recommend it.",
         "The story told in this movie made me feel so connected to the intensity of the pain caused to Rain and her family and the children, by those who tried to destroy their way of life in all past, present and future. Rain and all the characters were forced into the dark secrets of the past because it had found their way into their lives and inescapable. I enjoyed how the movie was thought out, visually, conceptually, and with some sit on the edge of your seat suspense. Further more I applaud the development of the characters continuously going deeper and watching them change on the screen, to accomplish all those angles so timely makes it like another world to look into with all the players both in Rain's life and on the reservation, feeling like I get to see the big picture. The fluidity of the many circles and connections seen in the film make the final story such a great accomplishment, and a great conversational piece.",
         "A native American horror movie? \"older than America\" Is a native American thriller/ drama/ horror based on an Indian reservation. In the beginning the movie follows a geologist that has come to the reservation to investigate an earthquake that is uncommon in those parts. That story is kinda of a parallel story that never merges with the main story of the move. The main story centers around a school that was abusive to native American kids. It also follows the main character rain and her problems with seeing things that aren't really there. After looking at how the movie has two stories that never merge, how it is poorly directed, and by how it does not have an interesting story line I say that this is a bad quality movie.* As someone who enjoys a good thriller/ drama/ horror movie I thought the director Did not do a good job directing the movie. The two stories never really merge which leads me to come to the conclusion that the first story was just a filler for time Or they just wanted to add a famous face to the mix, Bradley cooper. interestingly The director was actually in the movie and though i understand it is hard to find Native American actors she should have spent more time actually directing the movie and the acting seemed mediocre at best.. The camera angles were subpar and I thought that the lighting was also not quality as it is hard to see some parts. The abuse of native American children during that time is a real and serious issue. The plot of this movie did not really do that serious part of history justice. The serious truths were cluttered by flashbacks, scenes of electroshock therapy, people building resorts on sacred land, and a deranged priest, Only to show small flashbacks of a boarding school that should have been mentioned a great deal more. At the end the movie gives some pretty gruesome facts about native American children in boarding school which implies it wants to get across a serious message. It simply does not. To a person who is interested in watching poor quality movies, this is A great movie for you to watch. Many elements of the story clutter what should be the actual intention of the movie, The directing is subpar, and it is simply not an interesting story. The movie was originally released in 2008 under the title of \" older than America\" and was re- released in 2012 under the title \"american Evil\". This movie also went straight to DVD. These fact show that No one really ever wanted to watch it and i'm not even sure it was intended to be a quality movie that people wanted to watch.",
         "In Minnesota, modernized Native American couple Georgina Lightning (as Rain) and Adam Beach (as John \"Johnny\" Goodfeather) are troubled by her nightmarish visions. With help from visiting geologist Bradley Cooper (as Luke Patterson), they uncover some mysterious events. \"Older Than America\" is an issue-oriented film, it explores / exposes the United States government's policy of taking Native American children away from families and reservations in order to assimilate. The emphasis is on making these children Christian (using abominable force). Writer/director Lightning's topic is commendable, but the use of the supernatural does not work; that even Mr. Cooper, in town to investigate an earthquake, has visions perpetuates myths of different color. This can work well in drama, just not this time. The song played over the end credits, \"Someone Call an Angel Down\" written and performed by Derek Miller, provides a haunting coda. ***** Older Than America (3/8/08) Georgina Lightning ~ Georgina Lightning, Adam Beach, Bradley Cooper, Tantoo Cardinal",
         "The main subject of this film i.e. the attempted destruction of Native American culture and identity is a really important subject matter. So why has this been cheapened by using it as the plot to a two bit ghost story? As other reviewers have stated.. the acting is shocking, the dialogue child-like and the plot is all over the place. I am still not sure why the geologist character was in the film at all. At the start he saw a vision of a dead friend of his.. this is never again mentioned as the film progresses. There is a bizarre murder of an official which plays no significance to the rest of the film. The whole thing is bizarre. The money put into this would have been far better spent on creating a documentary examining the real impact of real live characters who were abused by the system featured in the film. As a Brit I know almost nothing about modern native American culture.. after watching this film this is still the case. It just seemed to be filled with as many clichés as I would see in Twilight or other 'fantasy' films featuring Native Americans.",
         "So where do I start? I guess I should start by saying why I am reviewing this in the first place. As you may have noticed, there are some 10 star reviews which are obviously written by those whom have never watched a film before or they have just fallen asleep through most of it and dreamt what they missed... This film is in no way, at all, in any time, in any place or mind worth giving even a chance! I have never been so bored and never looked around to see the faces of confusion on how bad a film is...ever! Everyone who I watched this film with was just looking at each other as if to say \"are we really watching this?\" Sure enough, everyone I was watching this with in my home, on a DVD, decided to go to another room. Me being me, I decided to give it until the end just in case. Bad choice. Everything about this film is bad except for maybe some of the cast members. The Cop, his wife and a guy who is working for the government studying earthquakes are all good actors and so are a few others in this film but, the director completely fails them all making them all look completely fake and ridiculous. The plot behind this film is actually a good one of which is taken from true events. It could have been done with some of the same cast and have been done quite well if it wasn't for the director. It's got terrible lighting, awful camera angles, some unbelievable screen play which would not even be good enough for your worst soap opera and most of all an incredibly bad script. I don't write reviews often, in fact this is my first on IMDb but I couldn't not stress to everyone how deeply awful this is, just in case you may be stuck for a film to watch one night and decide to take a trip to the DVD rental store like I did. Thank God I only paid 2 dollars for this although it is not worth a cent!"
