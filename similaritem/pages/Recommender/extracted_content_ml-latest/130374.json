         "Going by so much outrage against it in India and subsequent banning of this documentary by the Indian govt., I started watching this expecting to see something offensive about the brutal gang rape incident or something offensive against the country. But as it went on, I was fully mesmerized by complete portrayal of truth and reality encompassing most relevant and notable people. This is one of the most terrific and marvelous pieces of documentary ever created. It really amazes me how BBC comes out with such realistic works that even the local media houses fail to capture. The best part of the whole documentary is the true depiction of one of the victims and the way director captured him with zoomed visuals focusing on his body movements and portraying the true mindset of a criminal. I hope this documentary stays on the internet so that willing Indian adult citizens can watch it. Once again, there is nothing offensive in this documentary against the victim, her family or to the country. It is just a realistic piece of work that Indian govt. should support than to ban it. I can't understand that if parents of the victim supported this documentary to such an extent than why should the govt. be so worried about. Hats off and salute to Leslee Udwin and her team. Kudos to the BBC !",
         "India'a Daughter, a documentary by Leslee Udwin (it is part of BBC's ongoing Storyville series), is based on Delhi Gang Rape of 2012. This is not my effort to review this documentary. I am just putting across my thoughts. With great angst, helplessness, lump in my throat and tears in my eyes, I watched the whole documentary. The events were reconstructed to show the incident which occurred on 16th December, 2012. I have no clue, why Indian government tried to put a ban on its release in India (it was supposed to be broadcast on 8th March, 2015 on NDTV 24 X 7 and by BBC). BBC decided to do the broadcast on 5th March, 2015. The documentary has not projected India in bad light. It has not fabricated the truth. I went through loads of emotions while watching this documentary, felt the pain of Jyoti, pain of her parents, also loads of anger towards the attitude of the guilty, and defense lawyers. Why the hue and cry over the documentary and why the ban: The documentary states at the beginning that it has been made with the co-operation of Jyoti's parents (even reveals her name). It covers the interviews of Jyoti's parents, Mukesh (one of the guilty man), defense lawyers � ML Sharma and AP Singh, two surviving members of the JS Verma Committee set up to modify India's rape laws (after Jyoti's death), the person who first saw Jyoti and her friend lying naked and bleeding on the footpath (who got bed sheet and water from a hotel on the other side of the road), the police officers who investigated the case, the doctor who examined her, and also the families of the rapists, including the mother of the juvenile. The documentary also shows the interview of Kavita Krishnan who says, how the protests happened. It is shocking to see Mukesh narrating the incident without any sense of guilt. No sense of regret is felt in his voice. He says that it was girl's fault. According to him, she should have been silent and allowed them to rape her. Oh my God! What a sick mentality. He says, how they threw both of them before gleefully divvying up the belongings. One rapist got a pair of shoes, another scored a jacket. An item which was left behind was probably her intestines which they wrapped in a piece of cloth and pitched it through the window. Mukesh even argues that the death penalty for rape could only be bad news for victims: \"Now when they rape, they won't leave the girl like we did. They will kill her. Especially the criminal types.\" He is sitting very coolly without any visible expressions, when he was read out the list of Jyoti's injuries � from bite marks to the removal of her intestines. Flicker of a smile playing on his lips actually irritated me. It is unnerving to see this unfazed Mukesh looking into the camera and narrating the happenings of that night as if he was narrating some film story. His manner of describing his fellow convicts and also about his dead brother and reiterating the thought that they needed to teach the girl and the boy a lesson is absolutely disgusting. This unapologetic misogyny is so disturbing. Another shocking thing was responses from the defense lawyers - ML Sharma and AP SIngh. Their biases and prejudices are disturbing. No identity for females of their own according to these lawyers. They describe women in terms as disparate as diamonds, food and flowers � objectifying the female fraternity. Look at ML Sharma's analogies and logics: \"She should not be put out on the street just like food. The 'lady' in the other hand, we can say the 'girl' or the 'woman', are more precious than a gem, that a diamond. It is up to you how you want to keep the diamond in your hand. If you put the diamond on the street, certainly the dog will take it out. You can't stop it.\" AP Singh is shown saying: \"If my daughter or sister engaged in pre- marital activities and disgraced herself and allowed herself to lose face and character by doing such things, I would most certainly take this sort of sister or daughter to my farmhouse, and in front of my entire family, I would put petrol on her and set her alight.\" Asked later if he stood by those comments, he insisted that he did. Do they even deserve to be lawyers? It is so painful to see Jyoti's parents Asha Singh and Badri Singh. Jyoti was the light of their lives, and now they don't have clue, how to move ahead and leave behind the tragic death of her daughter. They are simply inconsolable. Her father Badri Singh tells Udwin: \"I wish that whatever darkness there is in the world should be dispelled by this light.\" In spite of the fact that Indian government has banned this documentary to be broadcast in India, Badri Singh tells NDTV that everyone must see 'India's Daughter'. A few thoughts: The tragedy is, no change has happened even after this Nirbhaya incident. Reports say that a girl / woman is raped every 20 minutes. Leslee Udwin has not shown that there is some easy answers or quick fix solutions to this. Justice Leila Seth puts it across so aptly that change is not impossible. Education is the answer, sure, and hope is something that we haven't completely done away with. For there's nothing that a person is not capable of � one just needs to strike the correct notes. India's Daughter has lot of moist eyes moments. Just an attempt to compile my thoughts after watching the documentary with a great lump in my throat.",
         "The documentary covers the unfortunate incident that occurred on Dec 16, 2012. A rarest of rare case that shook the whole nation. The documentary is short, simple and to the point. It gives to you straight, what's wrong with the society. The Gender Inequality that prevails in the society even today. How the mentality needs to be changed. If the government thinks it puts us in a bad light then they should think about delivering the verdict fast and giving justice to the deceased, because delaying that is a shame. The ban should be lifted, it should be up to us if we want to watch it or not. Hope there comes a day when we all can live peacefully without fear.",
         "I live in India and the point of view towards women in our society from Historical culture heritage till modern world is described at utmost accurately as Mirror shows our true face in reflection. Recent claims of Leaders about knowing truth will educate people about criminal mind thinking and people would act accordingly. Decision of ban was made and all copies of this videos were completely removed instantly. This turned out nothing but false statement, in video there is not a single thing about it. A tragic event took place and shook the world in December 2012. Everything and anything about a innocent girl, who was passionate about opening a hospital in her rural village to help locals in future is ruined as she was suffered a brutal death caused by four low mindset criminals in one unfortunate night. Impact before and after incident on lives of victim and criminals involved is recorded as it is, not a shingle shred of unwanted education is exhibited. The act of ban indicating rigid, inflexible mindset of Leaders towards change in Modern society taped in video clearly. This BBC documentary is banned by our current Indian Leaders, who are nothing but lamest person on earth. This curiosity to watch this banned Documentary in such a short notice is a remarkable step by government to stop the world from getting root of truth. Nothing but a purposely done to act to hide ugly mindset in our society that exists and faced daily in our life about child marriage, restriction on gender basis. Veracity of this BBC Documentary is crystal clear and everyone should watch this video. The Question raised in the end would obviously confronted by society. Showcase of what the tragic incident happened to common man, it was suppressed instantly by government. I believe there is no need to evaluate this documentary, because the Director has done a remarkable job in exposing the truth and immediate ban from Indian government internet is cogent evidence. Only one final question raised is that, when this creepy mindset will change about women otherwise consequences will be inevitability grave? That answer is only given by you, after all you are the judge.",
         "British actress/producer Ms. Leslee Udwin's documentary \"India's Daughter\" possesses a redeeming quality. It does not have any controversial material which could help in sensationalizing the brutal crime which took place on 16th December 2012. This is something crucial which its detractors should note before they accuse it of denigrating India. Its strength lies in the fact that it makes a genuinely bold attempt to make sense of the tragedy which has destroyed late Ms. Jyoti Singh Pandey's family. For this purpose the balance between good and evil is established by a parallel depiction of candid interviews with her mother Mrs. Asha Devi Singh and Ram Singh-a diabolical criminal who appears to be perfectly normal as if nothing wrong had happened. It is Ms. Jyothi's father Mr. Badri Singh Pandey who deserves audiences' appreciation for maintaining stoic calm throughout the film. India's daughter begins with poignant scenes which recreate events of the actual crime. They feature police officers, hospital staff, defense lawyers, legal experts and women's rights activists. It is through their interventions that one comes closer to understand the true reasons for ghastly crimes against women in India. There is also a brief footage involving former Delhi chief minister Sheela Dixit who describes why women are less valued than men. The heavy use of archival footage from NDTV takes viewers to the time when the whole Indian nation rallied for Ms.Jyoti Singh Pandey's cause. Without putting the dreaded scenes of poverty in India at the center stage which have been hitherto recognized as key features of numerous documentaries about India, Ms. Udwin's film is able to maintain its neutrality by depicting the sentimental aspects of criminals' families. In many ways, they can be termed as this film's weak spots as due to the nature of abhorrent crimes committed by the criminals, there would hardly be anybody who would like to sympathize with them. In an age like the one in which we are currently living, dissemination of information happens at a reckless pace over numerous high tech platforms. The banning of a work of art appears to be absolutely ludicrous in such a fast moving world.This is one reason why \"India's Daughter\" is freely available on Internet for viewers who would like to understand the sick mentality of certain men who do not want to see women grow and prosper in life.",
         "First of all I don't know what exactly is offensive in this and whom it may offend. If we expect the accused to be respectful to women or not say offensive things towards women ( which even the defense lawyer so proudly supports), then we are bound to be disappointed. There has always been discrimination on gender basis in India , so nothing should be expected from these people.Actually not their fault most people are brought up with these values. Lady in the Documentary says education is the best way to tackle the problems India faces , but I think poor people for whom making both ends meet is a very difficult task and asking these people and their children to go for 'not so important' education' may be a difficult task. So if my opinion was to be taken it should more be about making strict laws,ensuring better law and order in the country and teaching our younger generations about equality not just on gender basis but on caste basis too . Controlling population would help too.",
         "India's Daughter is a very difficult film to watch. And hearing quotes like the one listed above during the course of the film is definitely unsettling. Now I am not saying you shouldn't see India's Daughter, you really should, but the film is difficult because it's about a horrible case where a young woman was gang raped and very brutally murdered. The details are very unsettling and what's more unsettling are many of the interviews--interviews which reveal a sad rape culture in which the victims are traditionally blamed for these vicious crimes. But I am glad the interviews are in this documentary because instead of a narrator talking about the incidence of rape and violence against women in India, it's the people themselves who talk--and that makes for a stronger, more impactful film. The story begins back in 2012. A medical student, Jyoti Singh, took some time from her very difficult schedule to go out with a male friend and enjoy a movie. On the bus ride back home in the early evening, the friend was beaten and Singh was gang raped by five men while their friend, the driver, drove them about town during this long and horrible ordeal. When they were finished with her, the men literally tore her to pieces and threw her and her friend from the vehicle. Miraculously, she survived several painful days--long enough to give testimony which helped authorities find the men responsible. Fortunately, this case was not ignored or swept away. The Delhi police quickly began investigating and capturing suspects. At the same time, students from the nearby university took to the streets to protest this assault as well as to raise awareness of the prevalence of assaults in the country and the devalued role of women. In this country, the UN has estimated that there have been 50,000,000 cases of recent infanticide of females because folks often have so little regard for women. Likewise, violence against women of all types is largely condoned. As for the police, though they appropriately investigated the case, they also attempted to violently squash the protests. But, despite this, protests continued and occurred in other major cities in the country. The government was forced to do something. The story both outlines the series of events and allows many of the folks involved in the case to talk and give their side. Singh's parents, one of the perpetrators, several defense attorneys, government officials and rape activists all talked about the crime as well as the prevailing pro-rape culture...or, in some cases, made excuses to justify these rapes. In the case of Jyoti, she wasn't able to speak because of her death. One of the convicted men, however, blamed her as she was out late at night and said he and his friends were 'teaching her a lesson'! This is sick, but the lawyers were often even worse in the film, as one defense attorneys stated on two occasions that had Jyoti been a member of his family, he would have poured petrol on her and set her ablaze for being out at night...even if she was with a male escort! It's hard to watch and hear this sort of stuff and you'll likely be filled with anger as well as tears. However this is what makes this a great film--as exceptional documentaries are often great because they cause such a strong affective reaction within the viewer. You are angry and should be angry...and with anger, change is more likely to occur. A truly remarkable and important film, very well made and with an incredibly strong impact. Leslee Udwin has written and directed one of the strongest films of its type I have ever seen and even more remarkable is that this is the first time she ever directed a project!",
         "This film is so powerful-- I can see why it has the support of Susan Sarandon, Sean Penn and Meryl Streep. It is hard to get it out of your head once you see it-- and you shouldn't, you should act and be part of this important movement. The editing was brilliant, the access unbelievable and the content quite horrifying. The events will hopefully move the world to change. Leslee Udwin does an fantastic job of not only telling this really difficult story. The film is just over 60 minutes but it feels like it ends at precisely the right moment-- when you want just a little more. Kudos to all involved. This could go down as one of the most important documentaries of this century and it would certainly be deserving.",
         "Don't bother watching this documentary. This was made so poorly it's obvious this is for ignorant, uneducated bigots that believe everything they see on TV. The producers wanted to make money out of a horrible act and turn the entire incident into a documentary for shock value rather than educating people. Don't support these people; don't believe any of the crap in this documentary. Once this documentary released the friend of the victim who was there during the attack even publicly admit that the information they gave is inaccurate and fake. The so-called facts they give are racist, one sided with no proof and bashes an entire nation rather than stating what really happens. Throughout the film you'll notice they try to blame the entire nation and culture for rape but won't give any accurate information. India doesn't even make the top 10 countries for highest rape rates but they constantly pull out inaccurate exaggerated numbers about the country, clearly the producers of this documentary haven't done their research. This documentary is equivalent to those racist documentaries on how \"horrendous\" Africa is or how \"disgustingly insane\" Thailands sex industry is. This documentary is made to just bash India and send out false information. Waste of time, don't bother. If you're curious on what really happened then do some research rather than watching an hour of this crap, you'll thank yourself later.",
         "Its because of poor blurry pigs like ML Sharma that India still can not solve the archaic social \"laws\" and \"norms\". Someone who says he will gladly burn his daughter lives not deserve to be a lawyer, he belongs to the gallows or the electric chair or lethal injection in death or chemical castration along with his \"helpers\" as if the rapist he has dared to defend. These monsters are not \"people\", and can not be reasoned with. The sad part is that he is not the only one who claims really inhuman things like that and believe in them, a large part of society is such that the dowry killings, female infanticide, malnutrition, wife beating, RAPE..the list can go on. Rural society are the worst for him, first of all, they do not have adequate awareness and education, etc., regardless of the small piece of mind that you have can not keep up with modern India. Its this kind of people who can not handle women to be free and liberated and think in their wrong brain that his well within its rights to rape a woman. Rape is a clear example of that and many of our politicians, police officers, as well. All they crawl out of the backlog and narrow-minded parasitic colonies are grown and where it is okay for them to treat women as animals, something that will be used and abused. No wonder you can not sympathize with women victims, rural or urban, but instead seems to be some kind of perverse pleasure in a woman's pain."

         "INDIA's DAUGHTER is the story of the short life, and brutal gang rape and murder in Delhi in December 2012 of an exceptional and inspiring young woman. The rape of the 23 year old medical student by 6 men on a moving bus, and her death, sparked unprecedented protests and riots throughout India and led to the first glimmers of a change of mindset. Interwoven into the story line are the lives, values and mindsets of the rapists whom the film makers have had exclusive and unprecedented access to interview before they hang. The film examines the society and values which spawn such violent acts, and makes an optimistic and impassioned plea for change.",
         "This documentary film pays tribute to the remarkable and inspiring short life of Jyoti Singh and documents the brutality of her gang-rape and murder in Delhi in December 2012. It also examines the mindset of the men who committed the rape, and - perhaps most importantly - it sets these specifics against a wider in-depth exploration of the patriarchal society and culture which not only seeds but may be said even to encourage violence against women. The focus of the film's exploration is on the compelling human stories behind the incident in the context of a world in which brutality against women is so commonplace. Ultimately, the film is optimistic - the case has been a catalyst for change, and the massive public response to the incident bears witness to an attitudinal change on the horizon, which the film seeks to amplify."
