I had really been looking forward to see this movie, so I was a bit disappointed. I think the movie is best for people who don't know that much about horse jumping, because the jumping and the fall is ridicules. They make it sound as if she is this really good jumper, but at the competition the jumps are very low and her riding is very bad, looked like if it was her first time jumping a horse. And well, then the fall. I don't know how many time I've fell off an horse, but enough to know that that fall was very ordinary and didn't look at all dangerous. The acting wasn't that good in the beginning, but gets a lot better as the movie goes on. And a huge plus to this movie is all the good looking guys :D SPOILERS: The horse didn't fell or anything so how could it get injured? And in the ending where she tries to jump for the first time after the fall, why the hell does she not wear a helmet, I mean, in the beginning the doctor said that her brain is saved by the helmet, but then she just choose to jump without one after her accident. That seems pretty stupid."],
