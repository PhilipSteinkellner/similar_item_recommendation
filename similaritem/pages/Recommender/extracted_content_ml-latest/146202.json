Little does Annie know that this was all part of a big plan to turn her into a prostitute! They move to New Orleans and soon Annie has to start \"working\" at the job which was intended for her from the start. She tries to escape, but the Sex Traffickers have a network throughout the USA and send coded telegrams to each other. There is really no place to go. Even though this movie is technically \"incomplete\" since some reels are now lost, there is still a full story here. This movie also contains a strong message about how innocent women can be forced into working in the sex industry. And since they are women, the corrupt system is unfair towards them. The customers do not receive the harsh penalties that the prostitutes get. I was impressed with this movie. Although it was a different era (horses and wagons are often visible along the city streets) the message could still apply today."],
