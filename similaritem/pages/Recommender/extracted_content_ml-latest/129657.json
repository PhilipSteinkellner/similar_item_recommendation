            "content": "Okay, so maybe cinema life has not been so kind to hunky hotshot Taylor Lautner in the aftermath of the phenomenon \u2018Twilight\u2019 film series that had a majority of hysterical young female admirers drooling over their bags of stale movie house popcorn. The good news for the youthful muscled Romeo is that there will be \u2018Twilight\u2019 tarts lining up just to see Lautner read the middle section of your Aunt Mabel\u2019s phonebook. In the derivative and disjointed street thriller \u2018Tracers\u2019, the chiseled Lautner will certainly be a draw for the hormonal honeys out there looking for an excuse to scream at the top of their hysterical lungs. As a vanity vehicle for the ex-Twilight lothario the underwhelming \u2018Tracers\u2019 may very well take a backseat to the option of watching the film\u2019s star recite the aforementioned phonebook.\r\n\r\nThe best sell in \u2018Tracers\u2019 is indeed Lautner\u2019s kinetic physicality for athletically bouncing around in a synthetic, boneless urban suspense piece. The doubts are not questioned in Lautner\u2019s labeling as being an impressive physical specimen. After all, the performer certainly gives it his all in assuring that his fitness and finesse are on display to charge \u2018Tracers\u2019 with a sense of fueled urgency. It is too bad that director Daniel Benmayor oversees a fast-paced but flaccid actioner that offers a skimpy story in between the impressive gymnastic gestures of Lautner\u2019s harried character.\r\n\r\nSo what is the fundamental foundation that feeds the relevance of \u2018Tracers\u2019 existence? Well, in addition to showing off the streetwise marvelous moves as demonstrated by the movie\u2019s lead star, the gimmick involves acrobatic movements known as parkour. Hey, \u2018Tracers\u2019\u2026the mid-80s called and it wants its outdated fad back! Sure, the art of parkour was indeed an instrumental wonderment that gave distinction to the awe-dropping French import \u2018District B13\u2032 but, in the case of \u2018Tracers\u2019, the stunts looks woefully repetitive and never really gives any considerable flavor to the strained action or transparent storyline.\r\n\r\nNew York-based bike messenger Cam (Lautner) zips through the streets much like an errand bullet from a shaky gun. The cluttered and busy streets of the Big Apple does not stop Cam from doing what he does best on bicycle wheels in terms of darting to his assigned destinations. However, the crafty Cam receives some considerable heat when he is targeted by tough Chinese gangsters to whom he owes some big time money. Cam\u2019s antagonistic street thugs are not too patient with the beleaguered biker to grant them an expected payback. Bottom line: Cam needs to pay up or he and his loved ones will pay the ultimate price by being snuffed out from the street-minded riff raff.\r\n\r\nThings start to look up for the compromised Cam when his accidental bike crash results in his meeting (and inevitable attraction) to the fetching bad girl Nikki (Maria Avgeropoulos). The \u2018parkour princess\u2019 was ducking and dodging the cops prior to her rimmed run-in with Cam. Nikki, both sensual and sinister, triggers Cam\u2019s imagination and spoils him instantly with a new bike, not to mention his introduction to her parkour partners-in-crime, a bunch of high-flying, graffiti-loving street renegades that spend the majority of the time leaping and flipping on the city\u2019s concrete surfaces. Nikki\u2019s clique seem to hop and bop more convincingly than a twitchy kangaroo with a hot foot. Alas, Cam has a new crew and has adapted to the physical philosophies of parkour where he predictably excels at without question. Even the hyperactive group\u2019s leader Miller (Adam Raynor) is tickled by Cam\u2019s ability to soar in the air and make the hardened urban streets his personalized pouncing playground.\r\n\r\nIn its own clumsy way, \u2018Tracers\u2019 is well-intentioned because it strives to promote the art of parkour in the spirit of all those conveyor belt break-dancing movies that the studios kept churning out in the mid-1980s. There are some spunky and well shot scenes with New York\u2019s edgy landscape as the convenient backdrop for action-packed mischievousness. Plus \u2018Tracers\u2019  is\u2026um\u2026Taylor-made for the fit-looking Lautner to showcase his inherent athleticism on full display for the masses (read: the ladies) to be awed over with wonderment. Nevertheless, \u2018Tracers\u2019 never taps into anything innovative or creative to go along with the aerobatic awareness that the movie pushes so eagerly.  The flat and thinly-veiled story, patched-together montages of parkour-inspired pluckiness, the toothless tease of an eye-rolling love triangle among Lautner\u2019s Cam, Avgeropoulos\u2019s Nikki and Raynor\u2019s Miller and the ambivalence of Lautner\u2019s Cam to stroll in the garden of trouble-making tendencies all renders \u2018Tracers\u2019 as a weak-kneed crime caper that ironically lacks any genuine animated bounce-and-pounce.\r\n\r\nGranted this flimsy, frenetic vehicle is structured for Lautner\u2019s on-screen fitness skill set but the spotty material never quite capitalizes on the star\u2019s charisma or potential to enhance the skimpy plot with some meaty revelation. The stunning Avgeropoulos serves as automatic eye candy but her Nikki never manages to muster up any mysteriousness or cunning curiosity pertaining to her \u2018dangerous diva\u2019 persona.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the pulsating platitudes in Benmayor\u2019s impish but incomplete tumble-and-rumble tale is without a noticeable trace.\r\n\r\nTracers (2015)\r\n\r\nSaban Films\r\n\r\n1 hr  34 mins.\r\n\r\ncast: Taylor Lautner, Maria Avgeropoulos, Adam Raynor, Rafi Gavron, Sam Medina, Luciano Acuna Jr., Josh Yadon and Johnny M.

            "content": "> Recycled theme with the bike and Parkour stunts.\r\n\r\nI think the first time I saw a movie that had Parkour in it was the 'District B13'. After that plenty of flicks came, among them this one as well. The movie was about a struggling young bike messenger who meets a girl belong to Parkour gang. Later he joins them that changes his fate, but whether he gets the girl or not, that tells with the thrilling story development and some amazing stunts.\r\n\r\nEver since the 'Twilight' series, I wanted Taylor Lautner to make his foot steady in his acting career. Because I was rooting his werewolves gang in that movie. His last movie I saw was three years ago, 'Abducted' that did not go well. At least this one looked much better, but not enough. Like always I hope he comes back stronger.\r\n\r\nConsidering this film, the story was as old as the cinemas. A reused plot, there's nothing new. More like another version of 'Point Break', but everything was under a limit. Adding the Parkour and bike stunts to it, gives somewhat a new flavour. The young actors and fresh faces were highlights. From coming under the B movie category, it is simply a nice entertainer, but appraising from the out of that, definitely a disappointment. In the end everything is how you look it and what you get from it.\r\n\r\n6/10",

         "The two young stars, Canadian beauty Marie Avgeropoulos and Taylor Lautner, are both considerably better than the material. Which is a back-handed compliment since the material is pretty terrible. What you have here is a targeted-to-young-audience \"street drama\" with pretensions of being an action thriller because of the backdrop of Free-Jumping. In fact the closest antecedents would be the \"crime dramas\" of the 1940s. Sort of. That is a lot of ambition here and very little in the way of delivery. There are problems galore. The script is all over the place. Sometimes it thinks it is a rom-com. Sometimes it thinks it is a Van Damme knockoff. And sometimes it thinks it is West Side Story. The free-jumping scenes are over-directed. What that means is that while the film tries to maintain a \"street cred\" sort of realism, the action scenes are so well choreographed you might think you were watching a music video. This creates dissonance, which does not help the viewer experience. And the action climax, the last 10 minutes which is where most films get to shine, is actually weaker than the first 10 minutes, where the romance starts. Which is hardly a great recommendation. Bottom line: the two stars deserve better. Much better.",
         "He's handsome, she's gorgeous. He owes money lenders a lot of money, she's has some dough. It's your usual boy- meets-girl flick, but this time, there's a lot of running around and jumping, all in the name of parkour. The only thing that kept me awake was the action, which, after awhile, got a bit blasé. Lautner's character may have got into trouble because his desire to pay off his debts, but it certainly doesn't absolve him from using ill- gotten wealth to clear them. 2 out of 5 stars wwww.facebook/jeffleemovies.com",
         "Moronic bike messenger meets a pretty girl and then teaches himself parkour in a montage in order to join up with her parkour gang, led by an older guy who you will immediately peg as the movie's villain. Anyway, this dumb kid can't pay his bills and owes the Chinese mafia $15,000. During his training montage, I kept thinking to myself \"maybe this is why this kid can't pay his debts -- he's doing this instead of working.\" It's a pretty by-the-numbers movie of its type. The lead character is one of the most hard-to-like protagonists I've come across in recent memory. The guy is a total loser who seems to have the intelligence of a gerbil. They give him a hard-luck backstory that will have you rolling your eyes. He's a high school dropout who doesn't show up for work and turns into a thief living in a makeshift tent on a roof. I'm not sure he even bathes and he certainly doesn't shave that scruff off his face. The stunts are okay but the plot (and especially the romance) is uninspired. It's one of those movies where characters have to do the stupidest things at all times in order to keep the plot moving. There are also a frustrating number of loose ends that are not tied up by the end of the film. But there is a twist late in the movie that was somewhat surprising, so I'll give it that. Ultimately it's a forgettable movie but it's worth watching once. If you enjoy laughing at bad movies you'll probably get more entertainment out of it than most people. Oh and here's an example of this movie's great dialogue: \"...tattoos are like scars that you wear on the outside to hide the pain that's on the inside.\" Script must be by R.M. Drake.",
         "Surprisingly, this seems to be inspired by the book, Tracers, by J.J. Howard. Although, it is not listed as an adaptation, the book and the movie follow the same plot. Taylor Lautner acts in a low-budget action movie that seems to take the Direct-To-DVD route. Unsurprisingly, the trailer is unconvincing. Perhaps, the trailer didn't show much except pointless parkour scenes. So when I watched it, I have already lowered my expectations. It turns out that the movie is just borderline entertaining. Calling it an action thriller is an overstatement. The story: Taylor Lautner acts as Cam, a bicycle messenger, who is in debt. One day, he knocks into an attractive female, Nikki (Marie Avgeropoulos). And guess what, he becomes interested in what she does: parkour. If you are wondering where the story is leading to, for the first hour, it is leading to nowhere. You see Cam training hard and falling for Nikki. There is no sense of threat and there is no life-threatening or thrilling action scene. The last half and hour sees Cam realising what he has involved himself with. The action plot catches up late and it becomes rushed and pointless. It is almost for the sake of action sake, a character turns into a 'villain' and gives Cam the chase of his life during the climax. The parkour and chase scenes are not too bad however at times, they are marred by extremely shaky camera work. Acting wise is just passable. Music is serviceable during the action. Overall: It is screened in Singapore's cinemas. I would say the shaky camera work and tepid action storyline are not worth the watch on big screen. It is disappointingly tepid when it is classified as an action thriller but if you are able to overlook at its classified genre, it may be worth a watch on a rainy and boring day.",
         "Quickie Review: Burdened by the debt he owes the Chinese mafia, Cam (Taylor Lautner) must find a quick way to earn money. In his desperation he joins a group of street runners who use their skills to commit high-paying crimes. Cam soon finds himself in criminal world with higher stakes than he expected. Other than the parkour scenes there is no other redeemable quality to Tracers. In fact there is a severe lack of quality in acting and story logic. This should have been a simple crime-heist movie with some parkour action in it. Instead there are numerous instances of forced drama that you will not care about at all. This movie is simply a waste of time. Full Review: Let's be blunt here, other than the Twilight fans nobody is looking forward to a Taylor Lautner movie. Then again I used feel the same way about Kirsten Stewart and Robert Pattinson, but lately they have been making good decisions in choosing their roles. So I thought I'd give Lautner the benefit of the doubt. I was wrong. I'll give Tracers this, the parkour scenes were well done. There were plenty of these chase scenes and they did bring some excitement in an otherwise dull movie. It's not to the skill level of parkour master David Belle in the French film District B13, but the chase scenes were certainly the best parts of movie. That's where the kudos end for me. I think everyone would agree that movies should try to make us empathize with the main characters. However, the writers try to achieve this by going overboard and giving everyone a troubled past. I mean we have characters who are in deep debt with the Chinese mafia, have been abandoned by their father, had a mother who died after being evicted, living on scraps on the streets, attempted sexual assault victim. With all these problems and horrible past I'm shocked they are even functioning human beings! Every other scene is some character deeply brooding about how their hoping for a better life. Then there is a love story that doesn't make sense beyond \"hey you're kinda hot, I'm kinda hot. Let's get it on.\" Oh and of course that comes with an obligatory love triangle that you see coming from miles away. There is no chemistry because the dialog and the performances are cringe worthy. Honestly, why these people are even interacting together makes no sense. As if the movie wasn't bloated enough with unnecessary backstories, there are random twists and turns in the story that are very illogical because there was no previous setup. I am sure some will say I'm overthinking this. No, I'd argue it's the writers who overthought this movie. There was a good hook here: using parkour skills to pull off heists. All that was needed was a simple story to give reason for these chase scenes, but they try to add drama with poorly written characters and the laughable performances didn't help either. Definitely not worth parkour running out to see it. Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",
         "The story presents a common used plot line of a desperate loner who gets cornered into learning a new thing or skill only to get betrayed by his mentor at the end. The movie shows really nice parkour action. The freestyle bike and chase action is also not bad. What really reduces the action's quality is for me the way the movie uses the camera to capture those action. The overly zoomed and overly unstable camera movements may look good to the common shootout or hand to hand combat. But it cuts away great parts of the parkour moves. Taylor Lautner doing a good chunk of the parkour moves is really something nice for this movie. It really adds the authenticity. Too bad that the other cast don't really balance his acting well enough",
         "I really enjoyed this movie. It did exactly what it intended to do, entertain. The pace was just right for me. The character relationships were, for the most part, believable. I don't think they set out to win an Academy Award, but more to make a quality action film of this genre that would entertain a wide variety of tastes. The ladies will like this along with their men. The only weak spot was the character of Miller and that was more the writing than the acting. Also I cringe when an actors lines have to explain the plot instead of the story itself doing the job but that was very minor in this case. Marie Avgeropoulos is new to me and I want more. I rated it 9 because I got more than I expected. Truthfully I hope there's more. I can easily see how a series of films based from this could be possible.",
         "\"Tracers\" offers decent parkour action scenes and a better than average BMX action scene. The parkour isn't nearly as well choreographed as the opening scene in \"Casino Royale\" or most of the scenes in \"Banlieue B13,\" and is often not credible because the characters make seemingly blind leaps on unfamiliar cityscapes, but the scenes are shown in a realistic manner and Taylor Lautner the other actors seem to do much of their own stunt work. The script brings entirely new dimensions to the concept of \"lame.\" It might pull passing marks as a high school creative writing assignment if it were submitted on a day when the instructor was in a good mood, but fails miserably as a movie script. The film often feels like some insipid urban hip hop dance movie with predominantly lily white protagonists and parkour substituted for dance. The inciting incident involves the protagonist being distracted by the love interest to the point that he damages his property. In a fit of frustration, he discards it, even though it could easily be repaired and he needs it for work and he's desperate for money, then goes home to his well-equipped garage and does an analogous repair for his landlady's kid. Meanwhile, the girl feels bad because this person she doesn't know damaged property that could be replaced for a hundred dollars or repaired for fifty, so she buys him something to replace it that costs about a thousand dollars and somehow tracks him down and has it delivered to his place of employment. This is just one example of the muddled motivations of the characters. There's a Chinese bookie that wants his money right away. Why? It's not as if he needs the money. He should want his money on the street earning vigorish. If the borrower is still paying but running a little late, all the better as it provides an excuse to tack on extra charges. Why do the hero and heroine fall in love? Because they're both so irresistibly attractive, but have absolutely no other active love interests and both have athletic bodies that they keep hidden beneath baggy sweats. Because they have troubled pasts and limited future prospects. Because a movie like this needs a central love story. The romantic angle seems superficial, to put it mildly. If you're a criminal, why reveal part of your devious plan in a room that the police undoubtedly have wired for sound? If you're planning something that requires a team of five people to use parkour to get out of a dangerous situation, wouldn't it make more sense to rehearse in that same area so everybody learns the terrain rather than keeping the location a secret? If you need to stop the action for a scene with exposition explaining the meaning of the title to the audience, would it make sense to consider a different title? What does jumping through windows have to do with parkour? Characters are given flimsy generic backgrounds in a half-hearted effort to make them three-dimensional, but character development is pretty much nonexistent. The parkour moves are not nearly as extreme as in other films, but they're made to seem too easy. We don't see the grueling training that is necessary to master the techniques or any consideration of different approaches to clearing an obstacle. The dangers and need for practice are given lip service in dialogue, but not shown, other than a shot of a scar that has long since healed. Some of the free runners seem to be there to fill the screen, as there is little interaction between the characters. Dialogue is heavy on exposition with little subtext and even less humor. If there is a moral or theme, it would take a far more astute observer than this humble critic to understand it. Parkour is described as overcoming obstacles in your mind, but never becomes an allegory for overcoming the obstacles in life. The film lacks passion. Not that it should be melodramatic or devolve into pathos, but everyone behaves as if they are on Quaaludes when they aren't scaling walls. The most dramatically intense scene occurs when something happens to a car that hasn't run in a very long time. The parkour and BMX action scenes are fun to watch but not great. The story is a hackneyed and derivative disappointment. The actors do well with the action scenes and as well as can be expected with the dialogue they're given. The one love scene is shot so modestly it won't need to be edited out for network television and might not even cause much furor if shown in Muslim countries. Production values are adequate, although the use of jiggly-cam in static shots is distracting.",
         "Taylor Lautner may always be remembered as Jacob, the annoying werewolf boy from the Twilight Series. People have a hard time seeing him as anything else, but Tracers is the second action film I've seen him star in, and this kid has the perfect make up to be a huge action star. Lautner is more than just another good looking actor, as he can speak several languages, is a martial arts expert, and an avid parkourer, all skills he uses in his latest film, Tracers. Lautner plays Cam, a down on his luck bike messenger, who comes to befriend a group of parkour enthusiasts. What they do fascinates Cam and he wants to join them, but when he does, he realizes that they aren't just clowning around, they use their skills to commit crime, and once he's in, Cam has no way out. Original action films are hard to come by, as most people are satisfied with all the special effects and dead bodies. It's a genre that really doesn't call for originality, that's why when you come across a film like this, it's a breath of fresh air. The stunts and moves you see in this film are nothing short of magic, and it's star Taylor Lautner did them all himself. We are so used to seeing Lautner as the sensitive love interest in some romanticized film, that it's hard to even imagine him as an action star, but that changes 10 minutes into this film. It's the stunts, the attitude, his characters whole personality, that makes his a unique a-typical action star, and it is really something to see. On the surface, Tracers may be nothing more than another story about a group of burglars, but what they can do is extraordinary, and was really fun to watch. This film is original, fast paced, and brings to light a new action star, who isn't in his sixties or the WWE. It may not have all the bodies and explosions normally associated with this type of film, but as I said, It was a lot of fun to watch.",
         "It might be unfair to Taylor, but if you've seen Premium Rush (and you should watch that rather than this), you can see he lacks a bit of charisma. Maybe talent, but I'm not going to go that far, he's still young and maybe he finds his way (no pun intended). Unfortunately he's not even close to achieving that here. The story is a mess, the action scenes help a little, but the acting destroys most of it again. They all do look good though. If that polished look is enough for you and a minimum amount of suspense does the trick, then go ahead and watch this. But the movie does not have enough of everything to keep you occupied or on the edge of your seat. It's all too neat, even when it's gets finally \"evil\" for a moment. Add clichés and predictability and you have the end result here"
