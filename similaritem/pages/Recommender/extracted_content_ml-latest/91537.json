Her parents refuse to discuss what happened with her. She rapidly descends into a downward spiral of depression, and stops eating, to the point that one day she collapses in class. Then she is committed to a psychiatric hospital when after resisting for nearly a month she eventually starts eating again once she receives a letter from her twin. She returns home, but is still very concerned about her brother, believing him to be living on the streets; she decides to try and find him. After a year, she is still searching when one day she sees her father send a postcard from the town where Loic is supposed to be staying. She confronts him and he admits to having sent the letters, she isn't angry though, as she wouldn't be there if he hadn't sent the original card when she was in the hospital. Shortly after this her boyfriend, Thomas, is at a cemetery, visiting his Grandmother's grave when he sees Loic's grave. He asks Lili's parents what happened and they confess that Loic died in a climbing accident when Lili was in Spain; they make Thomas swear not to tell her. At the end of the film Lili discovers her brother's favourite guitar in the boot of her father's car, realising that her parents were lying and that he may well be dead, but she leaves it lie and doesn't ask them about it.",

         "When nineteen-year-old Lili Tellier (the sweet, pretty Mélanie Laurent) returns to her parents' cookie-cutter suburban house after a summer studying in Barcelona she's told that after a fight with their father Paul (Kad Merad) over his messy room her fraternal twin Loïc has run off without explanation. We don't know much about Loïc other than that he is a talented musician-songwriter and a rock climber who abhors his dad's drab conformist commuter-train life. Waiting in vain for a call back on her cell phone, Lili is so deeply troubled by the news of Loïc's disappearance that she eats nothing for the next eight or nine days. She collapses and is taken to a psychiatric hospital where she's put to bed and she and her parents are told she can't see anyone till she eats. This she refuses to do and her condition steadily worsens. Protesting this regime, Lili's father forces the doctor to let her see a letter that has come from Loïc. She gets better and is released and letters keep coming. They show Loïc is drifting from town to town, surviving on odd jobs and playing his guitar for money. Lili stays out of school and becomes a supermarket checkout person like fellow university student Léa (the radiant Aïssa Maïga of Bamako) who became a good pal in Barcelona, and socializes with her and Léa's meteorologist boyfriend Thomas (Julien Boisselier), who helped try to \"spring\" Lili during her psychiatric confinement. Loïc's letters are a mixed blessing. They give her a thread of hope but leave her in much doubt. Lili can't move forward with her life until she has learned more about Loïc and actually seen him. Is he homeless and desperate or just finding himself? Is there some deeper cause for his absence than a fight over a messy room � as one would think � and as the psychiatrist said there must have been a deeper cause for Lili's depression than her brother's disappearance? Melanie Laurent has to be the film's center and its mirror. She must achieve balance, suffering and fading yet still somehow appearing to remain alive also to a future as yet undetermined. Isabelle Renauld as Isabelle, Lili's mother, is harried yet always appealing. Paul (Kad Merad) is perhaps the most important character, a drab office worker, a shut-down dad, repressing his anger and self-pity, seemingly without emotion, but capable of more than it seemed. As Lili grows closer to the sensitive and pained looking Thomas, she learns that he and she grew up nearby and have similar backgrounds. The exotic and lovely Léa goes to Mozambique. Lili decides to move out of the house and Paul has new plans for himself and his wife. Don't Worry holds surprises in store for us. You might call it a mystery of family life. The film's delicate accomplishment is in the way it reveals a secret world hidden in the heart of the commonplace, love behind indifference, a lust for adventure behind timidity. Things are not as they seem. Like a book Thomas presents to Lili, the story ends in a way that is partly sad and partly not. To some extent the film stands or falls on its surprises because they are the necessary stepping-stones out of the drabness. The suburban setting is also central � identical houses that kill the soul highlight emotional ties that alone make life bearable. Lioret works in wide screen, with a bright, conventional palette. The depression happens in the light of day, where it's most hopeless and inescapable. There is nothing chic or showy about this film; it avoids either the glamour of elegance or the glamour of destitution and places its events right at our doorsteps. We may feel a little manipulated in the withholding of key information till the end, but this is how we're drawn into the characters' claustrophobic world. The acting is fine and the changes are subtly modulated, and Don't Worry succeeds in making us both feel and think. Part of the Rendez-Vous with French Cinema at Lincoln Center, New York, March 2007, Don't Worry had five César nominations and two wins -- Meilleur Espoir Féminin for Mélanie Laurent and Best Supporting Actor for Kad Merad. No US distributor.",
         "I was given this movie and did not know anything about it. I have been very touched by the story. The actors are very good in their roles and don't overact. The film was quite hard sometimes however it really shows how strong the family links between brothers and sisters can be. The relationship between Lili and Grenouille is also full of reality. It is hard sometimes to understand how the father react to the cruel words read by his daughter on the cards she received but it is his way to protect her and it is a very noble act. Melanie Laurent is a little rising star for the french cinema. I really advise you to see this movie as it is a beautiful one.",
         "Philippe Lioret is a sound middle-of-the-road filmmaker; he doesn't do precious or pretentious and it's doubtful if the academics who genuflect to Godard will ever find him worth even a footnote. On the other hand if you enjoy thoughtful, well-crafted stories well directed and acted he's your man. He gave us a top of the line Chick Flick in Mademoiselle in which Sandrine Bonnair's sales rep encountered Jacque Gamblin's jobbing actor _ he was part of the entertainment at a sales conference - and spent a bittersweet twenty four hours with him before returning to her life; Lioret used Bonnaire again in L'Equippier and once again she was on the business end of a one night stand, this time with Gregori Derangere but the film also addressed the impact of the outsider on a small close-knit community. He scores heavily again in this one - it translates roughly as I'm Fine, Don't Worry About Me and Melanie Laurent is outstanding as a young girl (19) who comes back from holiday to find that her twin brother, Loic, has walked out of the house in the wake of a row with his father. The parents make light of this but she was very close to her brother as twins often are and winds up with clinical depression. When she recovers she moves heaven and earth to find him but it is, alas, never going to happen despite the postcards he keeps sending her telling her not to worry. It's Julien Boissoilier, in yet another fine performance, who inadvertently stumbles on the truth which I won't reveal as the film was only released today. Suffice it to say this is one to see again.",
         "Philippe Lioret is french movie director. Most peoples haven't even hear about him. here's what the movie is about. Elise,let's call her lily, is a twenty years old girls. When she comes back from Spain, her twin brother is not at home anymore. He has left home after he had intensively argued with his father, and lily's missing him a lot. Very soon, lily will be reproaching to her parents not to do enough to find him. This classic conflict between parents and their twenty years old daughter may seem ordinary, but.. But Melanie Laurent, who plays lily, is simply great. Kad merad who plays his father is astonishing too,just like every single character. the movie is becoming progressively more and more better. Although the movie beginning didn't seem to be fantastic, when i left the theater, i was thinking: what a slap in my face!!! And if you want to see a great movie that put in scene particular relationships between different peoples, that will blow you away,don't hesitate, go see this movie.",
         "Elise is a young woman 19 years old who return home after having spent a school year in Spain. She meets again her parents and is surprised not to see her twin brother, Loïc. Her parents explain to her that her brother has left home after a violent quarrel with their father. But, she is astonished not to have received phone calls from him. She suspects that something arrived to her brother, but she has no means to get news from him. Then she decides to stop to eat. Her parents are obliged to send her to an hospital and it's only when she receives post cards from her brother that she stop her hunger strike. But things are not simple and she shall discover later truth about his brother disappearing. The movie is a very dramatic painting both on conflict between parents and child, but also on love that ties twin brother and sister. Acting is very good, specially for Mélanie Laurent and Kad Merad and I consider this movie as a great one.",
         "Don't Worry, I'm Fine is a relatively simple film, but it soars thanks entirely to Melanie Laurent's revelatory performance. The film is about this young woman's struggle to go from being entirely dependent on others to learning how to rely on herself and be her own woman, and along the way Laurent goes through the darkest stages of depression and finds happiness. She keeps us with her the entire time, our heart hurting when her's does and our spirits lifting right with her. The kind of emotion that she digs into and pulls out is rare to see in film these days, but she is at the peak of the acting world. The way she emotes her struggle is wrenching and very empathetic. As a whole the film doesn't have a lot going for it, it sticks pretty close to it's one theme and goes with it, but at the end of the day it's a character piece that finds it's strength in Laurent's extraordinary work here.",
         "Fans of Eric Rohmer,you have got to move on:this world of youth is not a rosy one ,not a world where all that a girl has to do is choose between an apartment in Paris or a small house in the suburb.Philippe Lioret does not show young people going to the beach,or contemplating their navel or waiting for the green ray. Melanie Laurent shines in her part of a desperate girl whose twin brother has disappeared.She puts the blame on her father (Kad Merad) but this man,as the movie progresses ,becomes more and more pitiful ,and more and more endearing.He's got a strong guilt feeling and the only time he rebels against a -perhaps unfair- accusation comes relatively late in the movie when he says he gave him all that money could buy.Isabelle Renauld is equally efficient as the mother and good support is provided by Aïssa Maiga and Julien Boisselier. In Lioret's excellent work,the character who moves me deeply is the father ;the conclusion of the movie leaves us with a man who finally gave all,who wrote his self-criticism,a good father who tried his best and who deserves all our sympathy. Like this?Try these...... \"La Stanza Del Figlio\" Nanni Moretti \"Ordinary people\" Robert Redford",
         "I have no words to describe this movie, it's not the most amazing movie i've seen, but, it cracked me... It is a simple story, beautifully acted, beautifully written. I saw it not knowing what to expect, but i love Melanie Laurent, so i said well i'm giving this film a try, and when the movie ended... i was speechless I is so real, it has so much emotion, there is no fancy things, no big things, no special effects, no no thing, it's just a feeling, the movie it's simply that, emotions. The simplicity of this movie, its beauty, everything about it is perfect. Watch it.. you won't regret it",
         "this film is basically one of the best movies i've ever seen (and i've seen a lot). it is very rare for me to get so exited about a film. it means a lot that i had thought about it all week and couldn't get it out of my mind... the story is hard to tell without revealing anything, but it all begins with Lili coming back home from vacation, and her parents telling her that her twin brother has run away... thats when it all begins. the main theme song is amazing, and the actress which later appeared on INGLORIOUS BASTARDS is rare... a must see movie.",
         "This is a very low budget movie. There is no very famous french actor starring in it, the director is not really famous. I went to see the movie with a friend who had already seen all the movies I wanted to see at that time. The most famous actor is Kad Merad, but he is not famous for is acting talents, but is famous for a show he presented on French TV. Nevertheless, I hope he will be famous one day for his acting talent. And I hope Melanie Laurent and Julien Boisselier will also be too. Because in such a low budget movie, you cannot hide the mediocrity of the actors or of the script behind great visual effects. And this movie fully complies with the \" good actors and good script\" thing. It is the story of middle class family with two kids living an ordinary life. Everything will be changed when the son, a musician leaves the house after a argument with his father. The daughter is completely moved by this. As we watch the movie, we'll feel a profound empathy with the actors. I hardy seen a movie where one can feel the subtle changes of feeling of the characters. It is so extraordinary that I wanted to applause at the end of the movie, as if there were comedians on a stage. It lost the kind of unreal thing that rises from the fact that it is a picture on a screen and sounds coming out of speakers. One last thing I'd like to mention is the main song of the movie. I was a little chocked by the fact the voice doesn't sound like a song made by a 20 year old boy. but it is really a magnificent one. it sounded to me like the best song Nick Cave had ever written, it is really a great one."
