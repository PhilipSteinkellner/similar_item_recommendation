      "reviews": [
         "I saw Lie with Me at another recent screening and I loved it. As a 30 something woman I felt that this movie really spoke to me. I got from it all the things I loved about Lost in Translation and the Sunset/Sunrise movies with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Visually I think it is stunning, and the sex is really hot, but never gratuitous or porn-like. The supporting characters are strong as well and nicely developed in very economical scenes. The film never drags and there is not a single wasted frame. Eric Balfour smolders and I totally bought Lauren Lee Smith's journey of self-discovery. I highly recommend this film � Hope it gets released soon!",
         "Lie With Me is 100% honest. The sex is over-hyped as being X-rated. The sex scenes are long, filmic and beautifully shot. The film is not really about sex, but about the psychological. The female lead enjoys sex and pleasure and shuts out love and intimacy until she meets the male lead who is very intimate and emotional. Not a scene is wasted. Supporting characters comment on relationships, loneliness, the body as something that is unsexy. The leads are physically beautiful, lovely to watch from a filmic sense, and give naked performances. There are people in everyday life like this and it's honest to see it up there on the big screen. A brilliant film.",
         "Probably one of the most honest depictions of the contemporary urban relationship dilemma to hit the big screen in this(or any other) year. Lauren Lee Smith delivers a performance that is, to quote David Spanner, Vancouver Province, \"a performance that's likely to be as good as any you'll see from a Vancouver actor - make that any actor - this year\". I couldn't agree more. The picture unfolds as a dark, yet very real glimpse into the life of a young, promiscuous,and emotionally challenged woman. Lauren Lee Smith was perfectly cast in an extremely challenging role that required not only an understanding of the \"dark side\" of modern relationships, but a clear ability to approach the character of \"Leila\" with honesty, courage and a sense of honesty that transcends most films in this genre.",
         "This movie is the best thing i've seen come out of Canada in awhile. It shows Toronto beautifully, in a way I've never seen in a film before. I think it is a very honest portrayal of women and sex. Not all women, but the women who cannot grasp what love is in relation to sex. This movie is entirely about love, and I think everyone's ridiculous obsession over the sexual content is underestimating the story. Everyone should see this film, it needs our support, and not just because you see sex, inside and out. You should see it because it explores love in a way that has never been captured on screen before. It explores love as something that is slow and developed and tangled up somewhere, as the main character struggles with the idea of its existence. This film could not have worked without the two main actors, who made this movie what it is.",
         "This is one of the most realistic portrayals of what it is like to be a woman who is sitting on the fine line between sex and love. Can you truly have both? Can you love someone and have great sex? I loved how this film captures the magnetism between two people.The heat, passion and possibility of love derived from attraction. The fact that sometimes you don't see love until it's too late. When you have it do you truly appreciate it? It also makes you see the addiction of those feelings, of being complete yet helpless in the arms of another and never wanting that feeling to stop. The main characters did a great job and had awesome on screen chemistry. One of the best love stories I've seen that wasn't like a \"chick flick\". If you have seen this movie already you might want to see the following titles: Wicker Park Or Love Me If You Dare (french film). Both of these movies deal with the Closeness and Connection between lovers that were probably kismet.Minus the rawness of sexual activity.",
         "There I was, lying in bed, finished the end of The Tonight Show looking for something to watch. When I read the description of the movie showing Lauren Lee Smith - I automatically thought about Lara from The L Word. I always wanted to see more of her (other than The Last Kiss). She's so beautiful and delicate so it was very interesting see her play this role. The chemistry between her and Eric Balfour was hot and naughty, but also romantic. It seems to me that she really had to let her guard down to play this role and I thought she was superb. Also, I no longer see Eric Balfour as Milo from 24 anymore, he has a nice body and booty. I recommend this film for just about anyone who is tired of the same old boring and predictable love scenes. This move is far from the norm in the department.",
         "I was truly surprised by the emotional depth and haunting quality of this film, which could easily have felt merely cheap and tawdry because of the abundant nudity and almost explicit sex that dominates it. The excellence of the performances, however, acts as a counterbalance to the sexual titillation. In acting this tale of the struggle between sheer lust and real love, both leads radiate a subtlety of emotion through facial expression and body posture that makes the largely non-conversational characters \"speak\" in articulated ways. The sparse voice-overs effectively assist the development of the relationship. In a society where wide sexual experimentation at early ages exposes many to the pitfalls this film explores, this is a strong statement about the human hunger for love and real relationship.",
         "I liked the characters in this film and the actors playing them. But the truth is this film falls short in its effort to examine sex addiction vs. the complexity of love and relationships. I suppose it is easy to dismiss this work as a well produced soft porn flick. It seems to want to be much more. The problem is the characters are not all that well developed. We do not know what the two principal characters find in each other that will transcend their heavy breathing. They say they love each other eventually, but who knows why? Frankly I have know idea what the lead female character has to offer in terms of substance. At least the male character is seen reading Steppenwolf and not the cliff notes version, either. So I guess we can deduce he has depth and intelligence. The female lead, however, seems to work in photo developing shop as a clerk. Yet she has quite a varied wardrobe which she somehow is able to afford. That's about it in terms of her personality and depth. But they do have attractive bods and I must guiltily admit I enjoyed that. If the sex scenes were edited out, the theater would be empty half way through any screening!!!",
         "I was totally enthralled with this film from beginning, to end. There really isn't much dialogue in this film, but I believe that is what makes it that much more emotional, and sincere. This is true life, it feel totally real- the situations and the sex scenes, not at all like other wannabes. I haven't seen a film like this in a while. It was very refreshing. I won't lie, I'm a sucker for love stories, and this one just happen to be done really well. I recommend this film to those who want to see something different from all the weak love films out there. I've seen quite a few, and Iknow those who decide to watch this film will not be disappointed.",
         "This movie disappointed me a bit, as I expected a lot more when I saw the trailer. We cannot say it's totally disinteresting, because I think the main idea is good and quite original, but the way this movie was done is far from being great. It's too slow and dialogues hardly exist. At some moments it turns out boring� In my opinion it pretends to be a complex movie and tries to mess up with ours heads when it totally changes the feelings which are supposed to exist in a relationship between two people just by sex, but it didn't achieve that goal, because it's too superficial at some crucial moments and characters aren't themselves too deep. There isn't really a plot, but a sequence of scenes, most of them sex scenes! But just sex is not enough to keep a relationship or even to make a movie (except if it is a porno�), and sometimes this film seems to be just sex! Beside that, the entire \"story\" is too centered in the main character. From the beginning it seems we are seeing a monologue, a \"secret diary\", where she tells us her intimacy, her desires, her obsession about sex and, most important of all, her incapacity to love! But her \"secret diary\" is not made from words�sex is the only way to communicate! Once again, it's not enough�"

Leila learns that her parents are divorcing and she is affected by their decision. When Leila meets David, she has a torrid affair with him. David is an artist that lives with his father, who is very dependent on David. Leila and David have a complicated relationship since he is a possessive man that demands commitment but Leila does not know how to love a man and has the need of different partners in her sex life.",

But all that changes when a chance encounter has Lelia meets and beings an affair with David an artist looking for a committing relationship. David is just as sexually aggressive and ravenous as Lelia and whenever they get together, they grow more hopelessly entangled, both physically and emotionally.",
         "Leila is a sexually voracious young woman who connects with men through brief physical encounters. One night at a crowded house party, Leila meets David and its lust at first sight. Later, as she has casual sex with a stranger just behind the house, David and his girlfriend mirror her actions in their car. Leila and David's eyes lock as they watch each other having sex with others, a courtship ritual that initiates their own sexual affair. Seduction is easy and very satisfying. Leila and David get to know each other -- which means being intimate -- in bed, at the park, on the roof, everywhere. For them, and for other members of their generation, sex is a form of communication. But Leila starts to realize that her attachment to David is different from anything she's experienced before, and David is just as serious about her. For the first time, they experience needs and desires that go beyond the physical. It is an emotional connection they crave. Afraid of the feelings they have unleashed in each other, they retreat to the safety of their former lives. Real life, and the messiness of emotional attachments, have punctured their sexual and romantic bubble and threaten to keep the lovers apart. David's father dies after a long illness and he turns to his ex-girlfriend for support. Leila, meanwhile, is distracted by her parents' looming divorce. Leila and David are trapped between two worlds. Anonymous sex, or sex without context, is losing its appeal. But a conventional approach to commitment - marriage and the seemingly inevitable divorce that follows, as evidenced by Leila's parents -- is not the answer. They set out to find a way to build lust and love, spontaneity and substance, into a new life together.",
         "An outgoing, sexually aggressive young woman meets and begins a torrid affair with an equally aggressive young man in which their affair begins to bring a strain on their personal lives."
