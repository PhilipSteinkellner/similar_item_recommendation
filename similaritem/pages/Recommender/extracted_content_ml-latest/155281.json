         "This flick being shot in Newark is all about racial matters about a black lawyer becoming a major. It's almost all talking that you will confront but still even as it isn't that good after all it is still on the wish list of so many film geeks out there. therefor are a few reasons, Don Schain the director was know for making sleazy flicks just like this one but became a well known producer like for example the High School Musical franchise. On the other hand, Cheri Caffaro, is here to see and does what she does best, going full frontal a few times so that's also a reason why some are searching this flick due this cult actress. And last, Lana Wood is in it, sister from Nathalie Wood. And surprisingly she goes naked too. As said, sleazy it becomes towards the last 20 minutes due the rape scene. A Place Called Today shows how the US was back then full of racism and not everybody going free of being a racist, black or white. And the corruption going on. It's hard to sit it trough due the talking going on. But on the other hand, such flicks are out of order nowadays. Only available on NTSC VHS and really hard to get. Gore 0/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 0/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5",
         "One of the few Cheri Caffaro movies. Yes, she gets tied up again and abducted nude wrapped up in a sleeping bag. The movie is very heavy-handed in what's supposed to be social comment for the early 70s. Altogether pretty dismal for a movie, except for when Ms. Caffaro is on. Even Lana Wood (Natalie's sister) can't do much. Still, I picked the tape up used for five dollars so I don't feel too badly"
