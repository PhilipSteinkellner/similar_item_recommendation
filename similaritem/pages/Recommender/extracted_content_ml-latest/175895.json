         "The film versions of Michel Houellebecq's novels are a sorry lot. The German filming of Elementary Particles comes out as a cheap TV movie, name actors notwithstanding. This film, helmed by the novelist himself, proves that the author may not be the smartest interpreter of his own work. If Mr. H. weren't a star, there's no way any producer would allow the release of his film in this shape. If you haven't read the book, I can't imagine what can you make of this abortion of a film. In deciding what to include from the book Mr. H. chose to make do without the core part of the book, the story of the \"contemporary\" Daniel. This robs the remaining sci fi/cult conceit of any deeper meaning and the story of the future \"neo-human\" Daniel is worthless without its human contrapunt. He focused instead on the part taking place in the Canary Islands, which is the least essential for the whole story. The actors are mostly well chosen for their types, but only if you know the book - they have almost nothing to do in the movie. I wonder why I am giving it even 3 stars - perhaps for some impressive sceneries and for one or two dialogs that work. The result reminds anybody who would forget that cinematic storytelling is a craft as well as art, and you can't break the rules of the craft without consequence.",
         "From Daniel 1 to Daniel 25. The opening scene of the Elohimit revival meeting is promising. The next thousand years collapses into an unexpected longeur. He once again addresses big ideas, but without giving them big thought or serious attention. This time the main subjects are mankind's desire for immortality, as made possible by cloning, and, again, human love. At times he gets bored with his own rants in misantrophy, racism, paedophilia and torture. The novel barks up the wring tree. The film is a cosmic desert. Upsetting that Houellebecq wasted \u0080 7 000000 on this project.",
         "The book is a masterpiece. And basically.. you have to have read it to make any sense of the film. Which.. basically.. is just a few snippets from the book. But it's some of the main snippets so there's enough for the reader to relate to the themes of desolation and isolation. It's a shame there was no real space for all the laughs from the novel (except the bimbos in bikinis) but.. there was enough madness and surety to compensate. Also.. there's a shot where Daniel looks out over the sea at an Island.. and an old man walks by with his corgi.. and that was worth the 10 stars.",
         "I have read all novels and poetry written by Mr. Houellebecq. No other contemporary 'oeuvre' is, in my humble opinion, as relevant as his. If you have read 'la possibilité d'une île' and watch this movie, you might be disappointed that Mr. Houellebecq did not include the main character of the book, 'Daniel the comedian', in his film, but instead replaced him by the son of the prophet, also named Daniel. I, for one, think this was a wise choice, because the story of 'Daniel the comedian' is entirely irrelevant to the central message and theme of the movie. The pace of and the photography and acting in this movie are close to perfection. No other director than Mr. Houellebecq himself could have filmed this marvelous book so beautifully: Mr. Houellebecq succeeded in transforming his poetic literature into poetic cinema. With 'la possibilité d'une île' he gave us poetry on screen. I sincerely hope he himself films more of his books."
