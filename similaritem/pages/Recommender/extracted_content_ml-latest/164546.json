      "synopsis": "The film opens at the Clinton Correctional Facility in 1995. A documentary filmmaker (Hill Harper) shows up with his crew and equipment to sit down with Tupac Amaru Shakur (Demetrius Shipp, Jr.). The filmmaker wants to get the real story from the man himself. In 1971 New York City, Tupac's mother Afeni (Danai Gurira) is released from prison along with her fellow Black Panthers following her acquittal of several charges. She is pregnant with Tupac and she voices her complaints to a reporter over the unfair treatment of black individuals in the country from not only society, but the system sworn to protect its citizens. From an early age, Tupac is taught about black pride and is witness to multiple injustices in his East Harlem neighborhood involving racism and police brutally against African Americans. His stepfather Mutulu (Jamie Hector) is an Afrocentric Black revolutionary who has influenced Afeni, who in turn influences her son and Tupac's sister. Mutulu is wanted by the FBI for a robbery of an armored truck and the murder of two police officers and a guard. FBI agents follow Afeni and her children, despite her telling them to back off. Mutulu is eventually caught during a raid when cops burst into the Shakurs' apartment, with cops violently pinning Tupac and his sister to the ground. As Tupac gets older into his teens, he distances himself more and more from his mother's ideals and behavior. He eventually moves out on his own, along with his sister. At one point, Tupac catches Afeni outside his apartment purchasing drugs from a dealer. He punches the dealer and pulls his mother away, scolding her for being an addict. He later takes her to seek treatment, assuring her that she is strong enough to overcome her addiction. During his teen years, Tupac attends the Baltimore School for the Arts where he becomes close friends with Jada Pinkett (Kat Graham). She promises that they will always be friends. Tupac reads her a poem that he wrote for her and about her. Tupac's music career starts when he joins the Digital Underground record company for their hit \"Same Song\". Under his manager Leila Steinberg (Lauren Cohan), he begins to have hip-hop albums produced. Although his music is popular, he gets into hot water with record producers for songs like \"Brenda's Got a Baby\", which is about a young girl who is raped by her cousin, has a baby on the bathroom floor, turns to prostitution and selling drugs for money, and how she is ultimately murdered on the streets. Tupac argues that the song comes from real stories in the streets of the impoverished and how nobody is willing to help people like the subject of the song. He also points out that the song sounds good, and the producers agree on that. He is also criticized of misogynistic lyrics toward women, which some speculate is attributed to his feelings toward his mother. In response, Tupac releases \"Keep Ya Head Up\" as a tribute to black women. In 1991, Tupac also starts an acting career by appearing in movies such as \"Juice\", as well as collaborating with other rap artists like Biggie Smalls (Jamal Woolard), both performing to excited crowds at venues. He generates as much praise as he does controversy in what he does outside of music, such as donating money to poor black citizens. He is seen giving money to two women and a little girl. Outside of his performances, Tupac has frequent run-ins with the police when he is caught jaywalking and is beaten by two racist officers. On another occasion, he and one of his friends catch two white men assaulting a black man. When they try to intervene, one man pulls a gun on Tupac and tells him to get lost. He goes back to his limo and gets his own gun. It turns out the two men were off-duty cops, and Tupac is arrested for shooting at them. Another incident occurs when Tupac is performing at a music festival in 1992. Tupac and his guys are confronted by other guys looking to start talking trash. Tupac tells them off, but one of the guys tries attacking him. Tupac fights him off, and a brawl ensues. Someone fires their gun. In the ensuing chaos, a 6-year-old boy is shot and he dies in his mother's arms. Tupac becomes involved with a drug dealer named Nigel (Cory Hardrict), and they do business together in music. When things go sour, Tupac and Nigel have a falling out. Nigel's guys want to retaliate against Tupac, but Nigel says that nobody touches Tupac unless he says so. The other guys appear to go against Nigel's orders. In 1993, Tupac meets a young woman named Briana (Erica Pinkett). She seduces him in the club and gives him a blowjob among the crowd. They have sex, but Briana starts stalking and harassing Tupac with multiple phone calls. She is with Tupac and other men in a hotel room one night. Tupac receives a massage from her and he later falls asleep. Briana barges into his room hours later crying and screaming, indicating that the other men raped her. Tupac is later on trial for rape and harassment charges. On November 30, 1994, Tupac is attacked by three black men in the lobby of Quad Recording Studios. Tupac is shot five times before the men flee. Biggie and other guys in Tupac's entourage rush to him before he is taken to the hospital. When Biggie tries to visit Tupac, he is turned away for not being a family member. Tupac checks himself out of the hospital early against doctors' orders. The following day, Tupac's sentence is declared in his trial. He is found not guilty of rape, but is found guilty of illegal touching, and is thus sentenced to 18 months in prison. Tupac calls out the judge for not looking him once in the eye since the whole trial began, stating that the judge doesn't care about justice, and that Tupac's life is in God's hands. This is where the documentary filmmaker's work ends. While in prison, Tupac hears Biggie's song \"Who Shot Ya?\" and interprets it as a \"diss track\" bragging about Biggie's alleged involvement in his shooting. Tupac encounters Mutulu in there, who encourages him to work after he gets out. Mutulu later murders another inmate by stabbing him to death. Tupac is also assaulted by two guards while in prison. Following his release from prison after serving eight months of his 18 month sentence, Tupac signs a contract to Death Row Records under Suge Knight (Dominic L. Santana), and he collaborates with artists like Dr. Dre (Harold House Moore) and Snoop Dogg (Jarrett Ellis). Tupac and Dre work on the hit song \"California Love\". He releases the track \"Hit Em Up\" as a response to \"Who Shot Ya?\" in which Tupac brags about supposedly having an affair with Biggie's wife Faith Evans (Grace Gibson). This causes a rift between him and Jada when she confronts him about the song, but Tupac is rude to her and she turns her back on him. While working with Suge, Tupac is witness to much of Suge's brutalities. During a dinner party, Suge calls out a member of his group for stealing money from him. He force-feeds him the food off his plate and has his other guys beat the man up. Tupac meets Kidada Jones (Annie Ilonzeh), daughter of record producer Quincy Jones. She is angry at Tupac for comments he made about her father for going around having relationships with white women. Tupac defends his comments by saying that successful black men tend to go after white women instead of other black women, but he meant no disrespect by it. He tries to sweet-talk Kidada but she has none of it. Eventually, Kidada warms up to him and they start a relationship, which evolves into an engagement. Kidada meets Afeni, and Afeni tells Tupac she approves of Kidada. In Tupac's final months, he decides to split from Death Row Records to start his own company to produce more music, movies, and TV shows. Suge reminds Tupac that he is still in debt from other business dealings. Later, however, Suge offers Tupac a chance to become partners, with Suge taking over the west coast part of Death Row, and Tupac taking over the east coast. Tupac agrees to it. On September 7, 1996 in Las Vegas, Nevada, Tupac, Suge, and the rest of their guys are leaving the Mike Tyson/Bruce Seldon boxing fight at the MGM Grand. One of the Death Row guys alerts Tupac and Suge to a gang member that jumped him and stole his chain. Tupac and company confront the gang member, and Tupac punches him in the face, knocking him to the ground. Suge and his guys start assaulting the man as Tupac is pulled off of him. Tupac stops by his hotel to change his clothes. He tells Kidada about the situation. She tries to go with him but Tupac assures her he will only be gone for an hour. Tupac and Suge drive from the hotel with the rest of his guys following them. On the road, they are chatted up by two women pulling up next to them at a red light. On Tupac's side, another car pulls up with several unseen gang members inside. Tupac takes a look and a gun sticks out. Tupac is shot multiple times before the car flees the scene. Suge rushes Tupac away from there and drives about a mile before his tires blow out. Police officers on bikes try to stop Suge until the other guys show up and one of them shows the officers his badge. Suge desperately tries to save Tupac as others gather around him, but Tupac starts to lose consciousness. The ending text states that Tupac died six days later at a local hospital from his gunshot wounds. To this day, his murder remains unsolved. By the time of his death at age of 25, he released 15 albums, seven posthumous albums, sang and recorded 713 songs, and acted in seven movies. The film concludes with a clip of the real Tupac Shakur talking about people knowing the real him.",

         "Damn!! Had the so called pleasure of seeing this so called Biopic of Tupac today, and well as you can see by my rating and the title it is not good. But do not think i am a hater, I love most films. And for the people who know me, they know how much I admire and love Pac. So it was incredible disappointing to see this garbage. It baffles me how even the actors involved were okay with this. This film has just bunch of random scenes, which have no connection to one an another and no introduction to lead them in, it was like the writers, and i do mean writers! because there was 3 decided to put random scenes and then were like \"How are we going to connect them? what will be their part in the overall story\" and the director replied \"Who cares, we will show the audience the progression from Tupac from child to adult and have it in between interview with him, trust me it will look cool\" But it didn't. Not only that, but some of them were not introduced or had any real meaning to the story, while others were complete lies. Jada Pikett-Smith came out and said every scene involving her was a lie and never happened! What?! Gotta be joke, right?... Nope, its true. She came out and publicly said it. I cant believe that after such great story telling biopics like Notorious B.I.G and N.W.A we get this piece of trash! I'm sorry but this movie was terrible. They made Pac look like an idiot. its that simple, he listened and agreed with people in the film from first contact, his actions and rise to fame were overlooked by him acting like a spoilt brat. his charisma and portrayal of thug life, gangster type was non-existent as he coward back from any real decision in the film. Do yourself a favor and watch Tupac: Resurrection 2003 documentary then this film! It is much better.",
         "Not only the actor ruined the image of the legendary 2PAC with his bad acting and ridiculous flow but also the script so badly written and produced that I almost walked out of the theater twice! HBO or a similar production company must take this icon seriously and consider recreating this movie for future generations to appreciate the vibes, soul and spirits this rapper has brought on to this world.",
         "The hype about this movie was unreal. Things like \"We will make Biigie's movie look like a cartoon\" were flying around everywhere.... What a colossal disappointment. To have the life of such a person and character like Tupac and mess it up this bad, takes a special kind of bad. I thought that a small scale studio would have done a better job in exploring some unknown past but instead it focused on all the mainstream points of his life trying to shove a song anywhere they could. The whole movie had zero flow, nothing seems to connect to the previous or future scene. It just feels like a mash-up documentary that someone made on Youtube and threw in a few Tupac songs. The point of the movie was to make people discover and appreciate the personality, vision and spirit of Tupac. To show that he was a visionary and more than just another \"rapper\" from the block who cares about money, ice and women. Tupac was like shown as someone who is only hungry for glory and needs to settle some score instead of reaching out to people and connecting with them through music. I can't really find one good thing about the movie except the Tupac's mom who only felt like a real person. The rest of the cast is flat out trash with no previous experience acting anywhere. If you are a fan of Tupac, avoid this garbage at all costs...",
         "This was the greatest blunder and disappointment in movie history. The director should be ashamed of himself! I don't want to get into the specifics of why the movie was bad. Just know that the scenes were choppy and didn't flow together, the story line was off, and it was widely inaccurate. Notorious seemed like a hit movie compared to this. One of the most saddest parts of this film, was the complete way they ignored his paranoid and prophetic part of Tupac. One of Tupac's defining traits toward the end of his life was his constant foreshadowing of his own death and his paranoia during his daily life. Songs like 'Only Fear of Death' and 'So Many Tears' are evident of this. He would rap about being reincarnated, coming back a ghost, and his funeral being empty. He would talk about being killed in his sleep and his complete distrust of all the people around him. This part was completely and utterly not discussed in this movie whatsoever and removes the most interesting part of Tupac out of the picture. That God inducing and and death side of him is what has immortalized him to this day to a prophetic level and it is not even mentioned in the movie. This movie has completely failed and this needs to be done over in another movie or perhaps a series. I would give it a one out of ten. Do not even go to the movies to support this motion picture.",
         "This trash had no business going to the big screen. You have a rookie producer and a rookie director tell the story of one the most iconic music figures EVER!!!!! The story was lazy. The characters were poorly directed., The best thing about the movie was that Shipp Jr. kind of looked like PAC. Other than that there was no reason to watch this garbage for more than 5 minutes. I looked like LT and Benny did all of their research on YouTube. It seemed like they took direction from the same people that probably game them money i.e. Haitian Jack, Sean Puffy Combs, and Suge Knight. This film was a disaster and a disgrace to the Legacy of Tupac Shakur. Its not meant to tell his story. Its meant to exonerate their benefactors. This is truly a poor excuse for a movie. This trash shouldn't even be on Life Time.",
         "This movie was a huge disappointment. Not only was it choppy and all over the place, but it didn't even get basic elements of the story right. The guy who played Tupac was decent but failed to capture the magnetic and charismatic part of Tupac's personality (which is the most important part). The other actors were also 'decent'. The fault of this movie lies solely on the director. Now its a very tall and difficult thing to portray Tupac's life in 2 hours and 30 minutes, but this was a HORRIBLE attempt. The movie's scenes flowed inorganically from scene to scene, and many of the things portrayed did not even happen in Tupac's actual life. While Jada's actress did a good job acting, almost all of her scenes actually were untrue and did not happen in real life ! Also, it seems as though the director doesn't even intimately know Tupac. The movie failed to focus on the charismatic and important parts of Tupac and solely focused on the hard/thug side. There was no scene about Poetic Justice, him living in the shelter, or the tragedies in his childhood from Baltimore. There is no mention of his projects to bring the community together and stop gang violence toward the end of his life. No mention of him prophetically predicting his own death. No mention or description of his decent into misery and hopelessness. There was a lack of the community part of him and an emphasis of the hard and thug side. One of the biggest things about Pac, was the way he talked and used God-like metaphors when he was speaking. It was prophetic and brought a certain chill to his words. This was taken completely out of the movie! In the Death Row East interview, they literally changed what he said and took out his comparison of Juda was to Jesus, and altered what he said for absolutely no reason! When you listen to the real interview and the fake interview, they changed it and actually made it worse than the real one. What could possibly motivate the director to change the real interview for a fake one? There were multiple characters introduced without a backdrop or explanation of who they were. I will not mention the scenes due to spoilers but there were two characters (who were unexplained and not introduced) that would randomly come and give him advice, and be shown committing confusing and unexplained acts of violence a second later. The director is to blame far more than the actors. The actors would have been decent if given a better script and direction. It is a tall order to fit all of Tupac's life into one movie. However, this did not pull off an average or decent attempt at it. It was worse than average and offended Jada Pinkett Smith and disgraced Tupac's legacy. Somebody has to re-do this movie as soon as possible !!!!!",
         "Honestly this movie sucked, the way LT (The producer) and everyone involved hyped it up they literally made it seem like it was going to be a masterpiece and even went as far as saying BS like \"It's better than Straight outta Compton\" well it wasn't, and they probably knew it wasn't because I heard they never even paid to show the trailer on TV or anything. Look, I get how people are saying \"they tried\" and I really feel like LT wanted it to be great but did he honestly believe for a second that he was meant to do this film? Did he not take a second to think what other films or experience he has under his belt before going about making this? (because he has NOTHING under his belt) I guess not, and I don't even want to give them props for trying to make it because before anything they should have realized they shouldn't be going anywhere near a 2Pac film JUST BECAUSE OF THEIR LACK OF EXPERIENCE! I mean LT has nothing notable he has done Benny (the Director) JUST has music videos and one random movie that apparently isn't very good (EVEN if his one movie was good it still shouldn't qualify him to be able to Direct a 2Pac film) Even though Demetrius did a great job playing 2Pac, and a lot of the other actors, it just SCREAMS something is wrong just because of the fact pretty much everyone except the two walking dead actors were nobody's... WHY WAS THIS GREEN LIT TO BE DONE THEN? PEOPLE WITH LITTLE TO NO EXPERIENCE made this film and THAT IS A PROBLEM, perhaps this is the reason John Singleton left the project! I heard LT's little story about how John wanted a scene where 2Pac was raped in jail and I don't believe that for a second, LT seems like a rat, and I followed the way he hyped this up, he was clearly lying, and if he wasn't he really thinks it's a good film then (Typical for first movies people make). The biggest problem was there was just way to damn much they tried to cram into one movie, honestly scenes will play and just when your getting into something it just stops, then goes to a new place, new scene, and it's like this the entire way through, THERE IS NO DETAIL, the scenes aren't aloud to breathe it felt, as a result there are just too many characters that just come and go, you never really see connection with them all and it's just tiring because you never get to see exactly who everyone is and what they did with 2Pac. One other annoying thing I thought was how they got Money B, Noble, and EDI to play THEMSELVES, that was wack as hell and just screams inexperience and even low budget (even though the film wasn't really low budget) and to make matters worse, EDI, and NOBLE didn't even say any damn lines! THEY WERE THE OUTLAWZ! 2Pac's rap group and didn't even say anything in the movie! Everything was just quick and rushed like I mentioned before, one scene in particular Pac tells Biggie \"We have to use that platform to make change\" and you want this to be elaborated on but it's not! It's like the screenwriters said \"oh yeah lets just put this random meaningful line in here to show 2Pac cared and then that's good enough! on to the next scene!\" Obviously they had all this written in the script, I just cannot believe they knew it would be all this content squeezed into a 2 hour film and said \"Let's film it!\" an experienced film maker WOULD CLEARLY REALIZE it's just too much and would not work. I have been hyped about this for over 5 years, I love 2Pac as do MANY other people so just that fact alone you would think they would have gotten nothing but the best film makers to do this, but that isn't the case, it really makes it look like they just wanted to get rich off 2Pac, they clearly went out of their way to get nobody's to be on board, I don't know man, it honestly was one of the biggest let down's of my life. What they needed to do was make this a TV series, a two part movie would have been better but not by much... a TV Series would have been perfect, there are just way too many great 2Pac moments that all need time to be explored and explained, a movie should have been out of the question from the very start... To top all this off, the whole suing of 2Pac's OWN MOTHER to get this done is absolutely bananas, and now that the movie has been released we can all see why Afeni (2Pac's mom) never wanted it done by LT... Real shame, 2Pac would be ashamed and disrespected! No lie 2Pac would probably have killed LT Hutton just for the fact that Afeni had a damn heart attack 2 days before going to court, its just insane, LT is probably the one responsible for her having that heart attack, just the stress of having to go to court could have killed her. In closing I just want to say, I don't respect LT, or Benny for doing this, they should have realized FROM THE START THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE REQUIRED EXPERIENCE TO DO SOMETHING THIS BIG",
         "Now I enjoy those biopics for many years, the buddy holly story, straight outta Compton, Ray and a whole bunch of others, but this lifeless, mean-spirited hack of a mess brings nothing new to the table, not only it's a disgrace to the legacy of the great tupac shakur, it is an insult to anyone's intelligence, shipp jr is fine as tupac shakur, but the rest of the actors are terrible, the screenplay is an absolute mess, the story is out of control, the writing is predicable and the editing is silly, I Agree with Jada pinkett smith, this movie is a disaster, more life a lifetime TV movie then a movie itself, this movie is just a total disaster at all cost, what a joke, shame on everyone who is involved in this film I give it a D- one of the year's worst films.",
         "Generally am somebody who dislikes rap, being a diverse listener of music while raised primarily on classical and opera as a result of coming from a musical family. However, once in a while there are rap/hip hop figures that are talented and have music that is more than tolerable for rap. One such example is Christopher \"Notorious B.I.G\" Wallace, whose life was documented in the 2009 film 'Notorious', which did have issues but there were things such as the brilliant performance of Jamal Woolward that made it watchable. Another example is Tupac, whose life is documented here in 2017's 'All Eyez on Me'. 'All Eyez On Me' could have been good, for somebody who did have an interesting life. Unfortunately it really does fail to do this artist and his life justice. 'All Eyez on Me' isn't without redeeming values. Its best asset, and the only outstanding thing about it, is the lead performance of Demetrius Shipp Jr, who perfected Tupac's look and mannerisms to startling effect. The cast were largely miss, but there were a couple of hits in the form of Jamal Woolward, again as Notorious B.I.G, and particularly Kat Graham who really tries to give some heart to the film and to her scenes with Shipp Jnr. However, 'All Eyez On Me' goes on for far too long (have sat through many long films and there are a lot that are brilliant, such as 'Lawrence of Arabia', 'Ben Hur' and 'Gone With the Wind) and such a length isn't justified by how little it does with its content. It does try to cram in too much, some of it in a short space of time, and doesn't explore any of it in enough detail. Some scenes were random and unnecessary, succeeding in slowing the film down and making one question why they were there in the first place. With the information given in 'All Eyez On Me', it all felt like a series of bullet points, explored in cliff-notes form at best and at worst telling us nothing. Didn't care for the idea to spell out Tupac's every thought when it once again tells us little, as one can see 'All Eyez On Me' is very short on revelations or anything new (which is misleading as it was advertised in a way that it would tell us something new and un-told) which is frustrating and feels like a cheat for fans. Some of it, especially the scenes detailing Tupac's relationship with Jada, felt like the truth had been distorted for dramatic effect/license. Didn't see the need for the narration either in filmed interview form, that was very clumsily inserted and basically spoon-fed events with no subtlety whatsoever. Amateur hour Youtube and music videos have better production values than here, and while the music was good a lot of the placing was random. It's all poorly scripted, flatly directed and whose bright idea was it to bring in performers and such as themselves and not give them anything to do. In conclusion, Tupac deserved better, in no way does 'All Eyez On Me', despite Shipp Jnr and Graham's valiant efforts, do the man and his very interesting (which couldn't have been less compellingly depicted here) life justice. 2/10 Bethany Cox",
         "I was truly disappointed after watching the film, basically because there was a chance to portray the life and times, the ideology and thoughts, and, the black and white of a truly exceptional being who was a combination of so many beautiful, unlovely, raw, and sometimes contradictory things and turned it into 2h 19 mins of superficial shots of Wikipedia references. Instead of introducing Tupac Shakur to an audience/generation that he may not be known to, and highlighting his significance to those who do, this film manages to render him into someone below average: No one will ever watch this movie and think \"Hmmmm.... now I get what all the hype surrounding him is\". No one will see this film and comprehend why Tupac's legacy is so important. No one will see this film and understand why he is what he is. The dialogue is not of a proper standard to narrate and discuss the life of someone who was a true craftsman with words. Many key events are done in an embarrassingly corny manner (Listening to \"Who shot ya?\" in the jail yard, witnessing a man being beaten by police as a teenager, meeting Kidada Jones, the entire *%$#&^% thing...) For those who are \"meeting\" Tupac through this film, I advise you to go and watch his interviews and read his poetry, because there's so so much more to him than this. And I think I speak for many when I say that a more skilled crew of filmmakers should redo this project, he sure does deserve it.",
         "They said John Singleton was trying to defame Tupac with his script, I'm starting to wonder if they lied. It barely touches on his younger life, glosses over the main bits and moves on way too fast. The dialogue is boring. The controversial sexual assault scene did not go the way he said it went so I'm wondering how much more was fiction. One of the biggest things I noticed was that Tupac was almost too perfect. People know he wasn't perfect, he was flawed, he was paranoid and he had a hot temper to go with it. This movie skips all of that. It's too scared to show anything that may put him in a bad light, but fans of Tupac accept his flaws and respect him regardless. Perhaps the next director who picks this up should remember that. Although the acting wasn't too bad and mostly the script was shabby, I've always thought Romany Malco would be a better fit for Tupac since he has a stronger on-screen presence and more acting experience. Someone needs to pick this back up and do a movie that actually fits his legacy, I'm not even a big fan of rap music or Tupac, but if the Biggie Smalls movie and NWA movie got such great reviews and actually did a good job, I can't imagine how annoyed Tupac fans are feeling that this is by far the weaker of the free. My recommendation, do not pay to go see this movie at the cinema. It doesn't deserve any box office plaudits. It needs to bomb to put the people behind it to shame.",
         "This movie wasn't as interesting as Notorious. Notorious concentrated on so much of Biggie's character and the rest of the people that were in his life. However with this movie 8 years later, it just was all over the shop and a disappointment. Demetrius Shipp Jr could've been given a better script to play as 2pac because honestly, the script made 2pac like a fool and the rest around him. As someone said on here, scenes were going wayyyyyyyy too quick and like, I prefer to watch a biopic that is steady and easy on the eye. Why the hell did they have to get blooming newbie directors instead of the ones who did \"Notorious\"? Seriously they know both rappers and its just terrible they let this go to waste. They really treated this project poorly as well as the actors. I say if 2pac was alive today, he would seriously be very angry at what they did to his legacy by creating this movie!",
         "This movie was hyped to be a wonderfully poignant look at an epic entertainer who made his mark on the world. It is extremely disappointing. With the exception of Tupac's mother, there is very little character development. Scenes are very rushed and end up seeming random, incomplete and not well interconnected. The movie jumps all over the place without developing the story line well. There are a load of \"era\" errors -- cars, cell phones, brands, etc... that weren't even around when Tupac was, but are all over in the film. This was just generally a horrible fail of a movie. I was holding out a great deal of hope and left feeling like my 11 years old could have told the story better - by simply reading a book about Tupac. This movie is a downright disgrace. There were so many ways it could have been better. It is shameful that this was even released. I really was hoping and expecting to at least be entertained. This movie just completely misses the mark. It is a waste of time to view this movie. You will never get that time back. Just don't do it. Ya, it's that bad.",
         "I'll keep this short and sweet.. It was alright at first, it seemed to have promise and had me pumped to continue watching, but it was a slow downhill from there. Now I look back and think \"what a load of crap\" Basically, it was WAY too long. I can't stand long films as it is, but this dragged and dragged and dragged. I was nearly falling asleep and the mrs kept asking if I was alright. No, I wasn't. I was bored. And tired. And waiting for the film to finish. That's not the way you want audiences to be when watching your film. It seemed like it was made by university students, too, as opposed to ACTUAL filmmakers. It was well made if you're making it for a college/uni project. But for an actual film.. no way. The acting was a little off, the storyline was only semi-factual, it was too long and drawn out. So we ended up walking out. I've never walked out of a film before. But I walked out of this one. So before you watch the film.. don't watch it.",
         "When I think Tupac Shakur, I think poet before rapper. For a man that made a career out of being a rapper, his lyrics and his music fit the soul of an aged poet. And like most people, he was a flawed man that was prone to the violent underbelly that often lurks in the Hip-Hop world. You take a man like that and many would be flabbergasted to even believe his life story as fact. The larger than life being of him should have made a great film. Instead, Benny Boom's All Eyez On Me is a vague biopic that never comes close to reaching the heights of Tupac's life and career. Plagued with a poor script, bad acting and lazy direction, All Eyez On Me falls very short of the extremely high expectations for this film. The film itself is poorly written. While some scenes are tense and Boom does achieve a sense of uneasiness, he completely fails at conveying any real drama with his actors. The film also is simply glossing over Tupac's life and leaving the viewer to rely on what fan's would call common knowledge. While I did know a little more than your average Joe, I couldn't imagine the film playing to the overall masses who do not know these little trivias about the man himself. It was pretty annoying. While the script is partly to blame, my biggest complaint lies with the most important part of the film: Demitrius Shipp. While I can't deny Shipp looks exactly like Tupac, I have to say the man is terrible as Tupac. He doesn't have the voice, bravado or swagger of Shakur. He feels like a simplistic imitation of him that, with more work and direction, could have been something. Afeni Shakur is portrayed by The Walking Dead's Danai Gurira. Gurira is criminally underused here and really never lives up to the potential that her role could have had. Dominic Santana as Suge Knight is extremely corny. He plays the character like a mix between a street thug and a lost puppy. Whatever he was going for, it didn't land at all. Overall, All Eyez on Me is a film that relies on the glitz and glamour of Tupac's life instead of what made him who he was. The film tries to capitalize off of the major success of the much more superior Straight Outta Compton. While it does have energetic music sequences that seem to sacrifice story for a cool editing trick, it never really recovers from erratic scenes of drama that really never land and a really dull central performance from Demetrius Shipp.",
         "There's no doubt that Tupac Shakur was a influential and controversial artist at the same time. He tapped on conversations that many weren't comfortable hearing in the mainstream, but was trying to bring to light topics that needed a light shined to break to those trying to find guidance. All Eyez on Me tries to juggle both the truthful and hedonistic side of Tupac and leads with really problematic results. Demetrius Shipp Jr., while many questioned his portrayal as the lead, does fine with the material given, and made me realize is the issue isn't Demetrius. Where the film fails is mostly due to Benny Boom's direction where the films editing crams in the first hour where Tupac came from, when he was younger cut in between talking in jail and the scenes are so brief and have no connective tissue between moments. Tupac's creative process is almost inexistent, outside of only one moment of him writing while laying in bed naked with other women after a drunken night. The supporting cast is okay at best. They don't leave me with much to say since they were just there. But Snoop Dogg's character is so obviously ADR'd (replacing the actors dialogue with the real Snoop Dogg). Errors in Tupac's life are more prominent than ever. Even to the point that Tupac is performing Hail Mary to a sold out crowd and the audience knows all the words, however Hail Mary came out AFTER he died. But nothing is as frustrating as the ending scene where it shows Tupac's unfortunate death, orchestrated with Gospel music as heard bleeding in the middle of the street, only to next see some text saying \"Six Days later, Tupac died in the hospital\" as if nothing happened in between time. All Eyez on Me is a frustrating watch because there were glimmers of a more dimensional story that could have served a character like Tupac better. The direction is lackluster, the writing is flat and try's too hard to make him a prophet, and the editing makes it hard to enjoy the film as a whole. As I left, I couldn't help but think \"Maybe John Singleton's crazy idea of Tupac in jail would have made a better movie.\"",
         "I grew up listening to Tupac / sometimes on a daily basis, even today in my 30's he is on every playlist I create. Needless to say I was sighked to see this movie. I came out of the movie sad and angry for Tupac and all his fans. Honestly it's been 3 days and I'm still angry - every time I hear his songs now - I feel bad for him. Someone needs to make this movie again. He wasn't just a poet and activist. He was an old school Thug.. An OG. They portrayed him to be some calm, collected, normal adult. He was anything but. Every scene only went a few mins then a change to story line. No depth to anything. The biggie and NWA movies were amazing in comparison. When you listen to Tupac's music you hear his rough and raw passion and anger in every lyric - this movie was inJustice to every lyric he ever sang. Just so random. Why not get a good director. Why not explore his beef with biggie more. Why not showcase his thug nature. Picture me Rolling? What made him write that etc etc. none of this was there. So disappointed.",
         "I waited. We all waited. I wanted to like this. I really did. I rarely trust critic reviews. But I do check them out sometimes. One thing to learn from a movie before its theatrical release is, if they don't release early critic reviews within a week of its release, then its because they know they made a bad movie that critics will tear apart and don't want that influencing opening box office numbers. Well this movie had no reviews leading up to its Thursday night release. I saw the premiere and hoped that this wasn't going to be the case. Sadly it was. I came out of the movie so very disappointed and underwhelmed. I checked online to see if critic reviews where finally released....and low and behold, they were just as disappointed if not more than me. Like I said, I rarely trust critics, but this time they are really giving you a much needed warning when it comes to this over-hyped movie. John Singleton was the original director before leaving the project because they wouldn't let him use his vision. He has since foreshadowed that they were gonna 'ruin' this movie. He was right. Sure the actor looks almost exactly like Tupac, but his acting was below average and his portrayal was very very off. Sure it has Tupacs music and some biased portrayals of his life, but this is stuff we already knew and didn't really execute the message in any way that made this movie a must see. There are a few scenes that seem nostalgic, but overall the movie has production value similar to a made for TV movie. This is unfortunate considering it was made on a budget of 45 million. The final act, that everyone really came to see was somewhat intense but the ending overall was almost disrespectful to Tupac rather than celebratory. This was an overall moneygrab disaster. Speaking of moneygrabbing, its obvious they chose Tupacs birthday as a release date to cash in knowing it would be a frontloaded weekend for the movie. Other than that, I am glad this movie will become a flop. When it comes to Tupacs legacy this movie should not be considered canon. Its a shame, this is a story that the public wanted for years. But it wasn't the right movie at all. Save your money and skip this and listen to his music and watch documentaries of his life. I hope the upcoming Johnny Depp led movie based on real life detectives who worked on the case of Tupacs death is much better. This is simply not good.",
         "To be honest, I cant believe this got a green light to be released in theaters, this should have went straight to DVD, it actually made me think of that God awful movie the Lifetime channel did on Aaliyah. I just seems like the director or writer didn't do their homework and talk to people who were really close to Pac, like they just used Google and read what we already know, and even if that was the case, It could have been presented in a more cohesive way, instead it felt disjointed and somewhat thrown together.",
         "This should have went straight to Netflix. This movie was straight up boo boo! I could have been doing something more productive with my time like building building that play better movies. I guess I was expecting to much. But this is PAC, like 2 PAC but on a more positive, note the nachos were on point though.",
         "The clothing I thought was exceptional, because I always hate it when films do a era based story and the clothing is so over the top and not near to the actuality of the time period. Same goes for the cars. I felt some of the cars should have been 2nd guessed upon, but overall, not too critical of that. In terms of the club settings, I felt that the looks of the venues felt modern and not retro to 1994. I don't believe there was that much LED lights going on in hip-hop clubs. Let's get to the meat and potatoes of the matter. The first 20 minutes of the film bore me to death. I literally sunk in my chair with each passing moment. It felt rushed, film just splicing together, and (spoiler alert) the direction of an interview from prison surrounding the beginning of the film makes me question why that was necessary. I understand they tried to be simplistic and try to hint to huge Tupac fans of his life and career with little pieces of truth here and there that weren't fully focused on, but felt it could've been explained better. The movie doesn't start for me until Tupac joins Digital Underground. Originally I thought until he joined Interscope records as a solo recording artist, but looking back at it, it really begins with DI. There were a few gem moments in the film that were funny or cute, but also heart-breaking and sad. You empathize with what Pac was going through. Still to this day, I feel Pac was innocent of the sexual abuse case in 1994, also being set up at Quad Studios with being shot 5 times and having jewelry stolen. Anyways, the movie ends with Pac being shot at in Vegas, no big surprise, except, that's just it. It felt so blatant, forced, and obvious. I walks out of that theater so furious and let down that I should of waited for this movie to come out and just saved the movie I invested into it. There is a small part of me that hopes this movie doesn't make back the 40 millions dollars it was suppose to surpass. Final thoughts. (Spoilers if you don't want to read any further). The fact that they tried to create a subtle yet obvious relationship between Pac and Jada Pinkett Smith is hilariously insulting. Yes, it is true that they both kissed twice in their lives with one another; including once to see if there was any chemistry beyond the friendship, which wasn't anything sexual. The other time was when they were on the t.v. show \"A Different World\" together. I respect Jada both as Pac's friend, and as an actress. The fact she hated the film/script is justified. Also the fact that she gave props to both actors playing Pac and Jada for giving it their all from what was \"Given.\" I felt Demitrius Skipp J.r.'s performance was exceptional, however, the way the script was and how it turned out became questionable. There are some powerful scenes he's in, especially the one with his mother Afeni in prison. One of the biggest parts of the failed script was the inconsistencies and inaccurate moments during the film that related to Pac's life. I wished that They started the movie with Afeni being arrested as a member of the Panther 21, instead they just started with her beating her own case. Again, felt rushed. i could go on and on, but you know how Hollywood likes to flip things around to make it \"Epic\" which it failed to do. Overall, this film was just below average, but average at best. I understand that there were rumors on John Singleton creating a scene that Tupac was raped in prison, and even that was true, and if Pac got actually raped in prison, John Singleton would have still been the only director to make this film work. It's a damn shame how I can't retrieve both my time and my money back. If you are a true Tupac fan, you would, can, and will take this review seriously and give this movie 3 out of 5 stars. Or in IMDb world. 4 1/2 outta 10 stars. I applaud the actors' hard work (me being one), but the script is the downfall of this iconic human being. That's the key also, the human being. It portrayed more of the Thug side of Pac, than the human being. RIP TUPAC AMARU SHAKUR and AFENI SHAKUR #DEARMAMA",
         "This review of All Eyez On Me is spoiler free ** (2/5) TUPAC SHAKUR. EVERYONE knows his name, everyone knows his legacy. The prolific rapper, actor, urban poet and activist may have had a short career spanning only nine years from 1987, to his death in 1996, but in that time he became one of the most recognizable and most influential people in the world. Until someone with a gun brought his run to an end \u2013 he was just 25 years old. Two decades on, and an unsolved case later the truth of his life comes out, in All Eyez On Me and it turns out - backstage his life wasn't as perfect as you may think. He grew up in East Harlem to an activist mother and a militant step-father; he went to a normal school and dreamed of being a revolutionary. Showing this in the opening is a promising start, which director Benny Boom whisks by in a wicked pace. The film skips to his teenage years he's surrounded by violence and drugs which his mother (Danai Gurira) resorts to. A by the numbers plot which sadly takes a formulaic turn as it speedily heads towards a downward spiral. Unlike the hardcore lyricist himself the film suffers from backstage problems. Boom's style of directing is a little heavy-handed; sure enough the idea is fresh as there have been plenty of films like this before there was Notorious and Straight Outta Compton. There's no light touch here, even the deviation between light-hearted comedy and serious melodrama is poorly handled. The shaky editing and the poor screenplay are no help either which leaves the film an uninspiring mess which is something the man himself was not. Albeit, newcomer Demetrius Shipp Jr. is fantastic as Shakur, there's emotion in his performance. From the violence surrounding his early years, through his mother in rehab to fighting his own battles, he's brilliant. And there are excellent efforts from his supporting cast too, such as Gurira, Kat Graham and Jamal Woolard who does an honest job playing Biggie. These efforts lift the film's spirit into trying sentiment in the third act, in the run up to Shakur's last moments there's an instrumental soundtrack to perhaps get the tears flowing. But after the previous acts being poorly executed this is perhaps left unearned. All Eyez On Me is a poorly executed and overlong biopic about a short, yet shining career of a seemingly perfect man that rubs off all the heart and soul of his lyrics. Tupac deserves a biopic as perfectly polished as himself, too bad this isn't it. VERDICT: This offers a great cast and sterling performances, but sadly leaves an uninspiring stench over what was once a shimmering career.",
         "I am a huge fan of Tupac Shakur. I think that he is great rapper but, once it comes to making a movie on him, does it really work. For the most part unfortunately no. I am a huge film buff and I have never seen a movie have as much grasp as this one. This movie sucks the audience in to the movie but once the time comes it fails to escalate us and lets us out into the open with no easily thinkable thoughts. This movie doesn't have any subject matter or doesn't get too in depth with what happened back in 2Pac's time. What we want is a movie like this to get in-depth but, it doesn't. So audiences who want a movie like Straight Outta Compton where you learn about the history of these symbolic musicians, you will not have the least bit of enjoyment with this film. That being said, the music and background score is flawless along with our lead actor Demetrius Shipp Jr. who was was the perfect rookie actor. He was the glory of this movie and hope for it.",
         "I am not going to bother going into the story,because whoever is a real fan will already know. The movie was a bitter disappointment,it almost seemed like a made for TV movie or something that should have just gone straight to Netflix.The story moves at a quick pace,but this is a problem. The movie is already fairly long 2 hrs 20 mins,but feels like it rushes through the story. The actors were average at best and no one really shined in any role.For this reason the best I can give is 5/10.",
         "First and foremost, let me just say right off the back, I am a huge Tupacologist. I was introduced to his music by father growing up as a kid in Essex County, NJ (Home of Outlaw Immortalz). Odd thing was that my dad was in his mid 40's. He had both a cassette and compact disk of Me Against The World and Biggie's first album. Not even ten years later, that music would enter my ears yet again, and my Tupac education began. Every documentary, TV series, and interview I dug up and watch has led me and millions of other Tupac loyalists around the world anticipating what I hoped to be a classic American film, and not just another hip hop movie. The best bio-pic portraying a man's life in the music industry has been \"Ray\" the Ray Charles movie. So accurate, so fresh, so classic. I've enjoy others like the Buddy Holly Story, Ritchie Valens, and a few others. However, after months, let alone years prepping for this movie, the moment I stepped into that movie theater, I kept praying to God, \"Please don't make this movie not worth watching.\" Well, somewhat passable, but otherwise, a let down. From what I saw from this movie, this film should have been a 2 part movie series, the first appearing on Pac's b-day, then on Wednesday September 13th, the day Pac died. The reason I say this is because just like Jimi Hendrix, it's impossible to capture a life so intriguing, yet so simple in 2 hours and 20 minutes. In many ways, I wish this was a t.v. bio-pic, and not just a movie that felt so rushed to get to the end."
