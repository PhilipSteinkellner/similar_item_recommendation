         "I love this movie and the other two movies in this series. I believe that it is the best of the series b/c it was a lot lighter than the other two. My favourite part might have been in the end when everyone is around the campfire and they burst into a horrible version of \"We Are The Champions.\" Though it was horrible it was hilarious and very cocky. I'm sure all of us would break into this song after beating everyone in the world in hockey....though it's hard to believe Canada didn't kick Americas asses. I am a fan of Queen also and I believe this movie may have had a great deal with that as well.As a girl I have to say that when I was ten this was the first movie that I saw boys for more than just stupid pricks. If you want to be a kid again watch this movie and enjoy but don't bash it b/c it wasn't made to entertain teenagers and adults.",
         "This is clearly above and beyond all other movies ever made and it definitely deserves the number one ranking on IMDb. It's not even close. Why, you ask? Only because it has everything a movie could possibly need. Think about it, you've got Coach Gordon Bombay, Pacey from Dawson's Creek, kids from Morgan Park High School in Chicago(I live a block away!) which actually does not have a hockey team, Keenan's knuckle puck, Team Iceland, Goldberg for comic relief, the team from Trinidad & Tobago whose fans play Caribbean drums after they score a goal, that hot chick from Maine, and We Are the Champions! Come on, it doesn't get any better. Evereybody now, \"Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack!\"",
         "Unfortunetely for us, the Estevez & Mighty Ducks fan, this was the last good ''theater'' movie of Emilio. It is very sad to say but it's the truth. That movie is really funny, you laugh even if it's way too much stupid. The cast play well their characters and they add new characters so it add a bit of fantasy in the movie for their new plot. It's not half the 1st but still it's pretty good! It's your typical fast-food sequel made for the big bucks but hey, they do what they can with that plot, it failed but for the fans it was a success!! Estevez always do movie at that time (D2, Judgment Night, Another Stakeout, Loaded weapon...) that man was everywhere and he was indeed my favorite, that's an actor I really miss!",
         "Rising like a phoenix from the ashes, D2 spreads its wings and soars to new heights of artistic merit. D2 is the rarest of sequels, a sequel that is truly better than the original. All of the jagged edges in the original film's plot have been streamlined, and the new ground being broken, (Self-Doubt, Conquering your fears, Sexual Identity) fit in seamlessly, giving this film a more robust feel, similar to that of Chunky Soup. Emilio Estevez (In his star-making role) plays coach Bombay with a smoldering fury that makes it very clear that he is Martin Sheen's favorite son. The rest of the cast is equally brilliant, especially the ducks themselves, whose performances are so real, you cant help believing that they are truly kids. The direction is bold yet beautiful, and instantly recalls that of the early german surrealists. The electronic score by Goblin is eerily effective in creating suspense in both the game and locker room scenes, and lets the viewer know that this isnt a game anymore, and that national pride is on the line. A masterpiece of baroque visuals and dry wit, D2 is a most worthy rental upon your next excursion to the video store.",
         "i liked this movie as good if not better than the original. some of the players are missing from the first movie,but the new players make-up for it. this movie is a tad more serious than the original. more nicely done hockey games,and amusing antics by the hockey players. if you liked the first movie,then i don't see why you wouldn't like this one. i give D2: the mighty ducks *** out of ****",
         "\"This isn't a hockey game, it's a circus.\" - Coach Gordon Bombay, D2: The Mighty Ducks. Rarely does a movie character sum up his movie so well. D2: The Mighty Ducks is a circus; a cacophony of conflicts, dopey characters, fighting, eccentricities, miscommunications, clichés, and inpenetrable goofiness. Here's a movie sequel that continues to beat a dead horse into the ground by offering the public a sequel to a Disney movie that can only be liked by reciting the word \"nostalgia\" or \"nostalgic.\" At this point, it isn't that The Mighty Ducks films are bad movies in the usual sense, but it's that they are so unambitious, uninspired, and bland that it makes it hard to accept them as \"take it for what it is\" entertainment and harder to like them on the typical \"good movie\" level. Emilio Estevez, still portraying the greatly motivated man driven on the idea of success, reprises his role as Gordon Bombay, who the opening credits show us has gone on to be a minor league hockey player being seriously considered for his first NHL appearance until he injured during a breakneck game. Now, Bombay's chances are done and he talks to a close friend about making money, until opportunity knocks when the idea of him coaching Team U.S.A.'s hockey team in the Junior Goodwill Games is proposed. Bombay quickly signs a suit's contract, bands the Ducks together again, and they quickly rustle up the skills and the motivation to win at this year's event and show audiences that Ducks stick together. Need I go further? Should I mention that the kids are now teenagers, yet are still as brazen and as goofy as they were in the first film? Should I go on to mention that Bombay becomes too consumed with coaching a more honored and admired team, and lets all the pressure gets to his head to the point where he is scolding and yelling at his players? Ned I mention that this newfound consumption on Bombay's part has greatly upset a number of players, fueling Ducks-heckler Russ Tyler (Kenan Thompson) to aggravate the players? And do I even need to mention that in the third act the Ducks will discover Tyler's surefire knucklepuck and graciously adopt him to the team? One can also make note of the never-ending barrage of one-liners the film haphazardly includes in order to sound hip, motivating, and high-spirited. When one of the only girl players is called a \"lady,\" she forcefully replies, \"I'm no lady, I'm a duck!\" And when the Ducks face their opponents from Iceland, the crowd chants, \"We will, we will quack you!\" in attempt to see how much the audience can cringe in a small period of time. This is kids sports movie-making 101, although it's not harmful as much as it is non-beneficial to any of its viewers. It provides sweet, genial escapist delight and I believe that's what a number of Disney-movie fans seek, which in that case, renders D2: The Mighty Ducks a success according to them. To me, the film is overly long and winded, still far to content with capitalizing on the surprise success of its predecessor, is chock full of clichés, and anchored by its dull characters and formulaic premises. I guess you can also say I'm getting tired of hearing \"We are the Champions\" at the end of the picture further capitalizing on \"the in-game spirit.\" At least the film knows one thing and that's how to properly utilize Estevez. Starring: Emilio Estevez, Joshua Jackson, Michael Tucker, and Kenan Thompson. Directed by: Sam Weisman.",
         "***SPOILER ALERT*** This movie isn't a complete and utter disaster, but it is pretty damn bad. I honestly just think that Disney should have left it alone, but no, they had to go and make a sequel to a really good movie. OK...the story sort of picks up where it left off, Grdon Bombay is in the minors and while playing he receives a leg injury, so he returns back home. Then he's asked to coach Team USA in the Junior Winter Olympic Games. Of course this makes Bombay get all his ducks back together, still missing a few from the first movie, but i think for the most part they were acceptable losses, with the exception of Karp. Then they go off to play, they start to win when...oh my God, surprisingly there's a team better than them that they will have to overcome. And heres the most original part, they face them in the finals...gasp...and even more original than that...they win. oooooo... The humor in this is even less mature and more for kids than the first. Which I think really killed the movie. The characters I think were the only likable attributes of this movie. Especially the addition of Dean Portman. The movie was also infested with music by Queen...watch out. Overall not as good as the first, by any means. 3.5/10",
         "Mostly a good , solid movie, marred only by 2 sub-par plot lines. The whole Kenan thread was a bit ridiculous - I'm not sure you can add a player mid-Olympics, even the junior Olympics, but even if you could, has he ever ice-skated in his life? Maybe, but it's never even asked - but the only big problem I had with the thing was the stupid knuckle-puck. As a hockey fan, it was a moronic addition that would've been best left on the cutting room floor. Even with the ludicrous nature of the movie, this was a little bit out there. Much, much worse, however, was the giant disaster that was Gordon Bombay's coaching. First of all, he got a big head coaching a junior USA hockey team that had trouble winning a tournament without Canada (and I don't remember Sweden, Finland, Slovakia, or the Czech. Republic being represented either), so it was such an easy schedule that they should have swept, but they lost a few games and had trouble with freakin' Iceland in the finals. Weak. Here's a suggestion, you sexist blowhard: play your best goalie. I don't care that she's a woman, WHY WAS JULIE SITTING IN FAVOR OF GOLDBERG!?!? Goldberg didn't even practice in the offseason. He obviously was the goalie because he was the fattest kid on the team, not the best choice as a goalie. Now, that's fine last year, when it's just a regional thing meant to be fun and teach sportsmanship, but you're in the big leagues now (said/written mostly tongue-in-cheek), you have to play your best goalie, which was clearly Julie \"The Cat.\" My buddy and I were talking about this, and agreed that the \"secret weapon\" status is exclusively the domain of a one-trick-pony type. In that case, Knuckle-puck Kenan could've been a nice option if you really wanted a secret weapon. (I almost titled this review \"D2 Review\" for the rhyming, but decided on the alliteration instead. I think I made the right choice.)",
         "As much as I liked this movie, along with the other Mighty Ducks movies, I just have one question? Where is Canada? I mean, Iceland??? Sorry but it is just hard to get too into it knowing that the team that wins every tournament at all ages, said team being Canada, was not in there. Its too bad really because they would have smoked team USA just like they always do. That would have made the movie so much better! But I guess it makes sense in a way. I guess the writers of the movie knew that if they included Canada in the movie, it just wouldn't make sense to have Team USA beat them, so they put a team like Iceland in it instead so it would be easier for the Americans to win, and more realistic in a way. But still, Writers, Canada wins every time. It would have been nice to include them because we all know, there is nothing wrong with the team the movie is centred around, losing. Take for example, Sunset Park. The team doesn't always have to win to make a successful movie.",
         "i havent seen the first one in years so i cant say anything about it but i watched D3 and D2 this month and id have to say i liked them both. in D2 i thought there were a few funny scenes and it kept me interested. oh and by the way did you know most of the actors were 16 when they made this movie i would have never believed it. oh and vincent larusso (adam banks) was so cute in this one and the 3rd one. and julie started in this one and i always thought she was really cool."

Much to his surprise, he is given the job of coach of Team USA Hockey for the Junior Goodwill Games in California. With most of the Ducks and a few new players in tow, he sets forth for LA. All appears to be going well for a while, but the hype of Hollywood starts to get to Gordon, and he is distracted when Iceland, the favourites to win the title, appear on the scene.",
         "After hurting his knee in an accident in the minor leagues, Gordon Bombay returns home. Jan has been promoting him as a good coach, and now, he has become the coach of Team USA. The Ducks are gathered again and joined by five new players- Dean Portman (a big enforcer), Ken Wu (an ex-figure skater), Julie Gaffney (a REALLY good goalie), Luis Mendoza (a \"speedster\"), and Dwyane Robertson (a cowboy, good puck handler). They are up against the world- including the big boys from Iceland. Can they win against the world?"
