         "I saw Rich Mullins three times in concert. I read every interview and watched everything I could on him and by him. I've known for the past 22 years that he wasn't perfect, that his relationship with his father was not good for most of his life, that he had a \"dark\" side to his nature, his soul. And I knew his heart had been badly broken by a woman long ago and that he never found another that he was interested in. I considered myself as prepared as anyone could be when I went in to see the movie. When I saw the trailer I thought that the scenes didn't depict the impish, whimsical depth that Rich always showed. I hoped that I would see more of the giddy nature Rich always had in concert, the hopefulness he always shared in his songs and in his interviews. Instead what I saw was scene after scene of an angry, tortured man who never was happy. Ever, except for once when he was dating a girl in college. I wasn't shocked that he'd gotten into drinking or smoking--he implied as much in his music if you listened. But I lost track of the times the movie showed him waking up next to beer bottles, or falling over drunk. And the depiction of his father surprised me not so much by how cruel he was (was he really that cruel?) but because Rich's own brother is a producer for this film. I felt betrayed and disappointed that although a film has to pick a \"thread,\" a focus, this director--who by his own words sees Rich as his \"hero,\" --chose to focus on such anger and despair for almost the whole two and a half hours. In my opinion it is quite possible to illustrate brokenness without having the protagonist be in a constant state of negativity. Rich Mullins was a non-conformist but the way the director/writer had it played he was a jerk about it. As I've already said I know he wasn't perfect by any stretch, but I do not, cannot believe he was a constant jerk. I agree with the statement that it was acted well, and Michael Koch certainly held his own. But whether it was his or director David Leo Schultz' doing, the delivery of even the \"fun\" parts with Rich and the talking he did during his concerts was done without the humor and whimsy that was quintessential to Rich Mullins. I also agree with the previous poster, it dragged in the middle in the very place it should have been exciting--the take off of his career. The upshot was Brennan Manning's influence in Rich's life. But as the previous poster stated, if you want to read Rich's biography and interviews, and watch him on Youtube you'll get a far better picture of who Rich Mullins really was.",
         "I'm going to get the bad out of the way. If you're hoping this movie \"solves\" all the problems of the so-called \"Christian movie industry\", it does not. It is too long by at least a half-hour, we never feel like the main character really is Mullins until almost a half-hour into the film, and it seems preachier than it needs to be, often using way too much dialog to communicate messages that filmmakers should be able to make with far less talking and far more skillful directing, acting and editing. Anachronisms abound for those who look for them (certain musical equipment and instruments appear years and years before they actually were available), the lighting seems to be an afterthought, and in many cases (as I implied earlier) paragraphs of dialog abound where lines would do. If you think this movie is just as bad as so many Christian films (virtually all that I have seen in fact) are, you'd also be wrong. Refreshingly, this film does not sanitize the smoking, drinking, cussing (okay, maybe it eases up on the cussing, I'm okay with that), broken character that Rich apparently was. That, I found refreshing. And when Michael Koch finally \"finds\" the main character (or should I say, when we finally believe in him and the director finally sets the character free), he carries it well, warts (and there are many) and all. I was impressed with how Koch sings and plays the part so well (using his own voice by the way), too, right down to the occasional sloppy piano and idiosyncratic vocal stylings. The stress of growing up with such a broken father-son relationship plays a major role, as it should, and explains much of what we need to know about the character (reminded me of Johnny Cash, actually). I was fortunate enough to meet Mullins during his too-short life, about 7 years before his death. By \"meet\", I don't mean shake hands after a concert, but in fact along with a small group of folks got to spend hours and hours with him talking and really getting to know each other. He was, by far, the most interesting person I have ever met. So� I am a little biased in saying that beyond the flaws in this film (again, typical of so many Christian movies, and of so much Christian music for that matter), is the story of a man who was worth knowing and knowing about, not in spite of, but partly because of his flaws. I can probably count on one hand the number of Christian songwriters who come close to Mullins' talent and transparency (even if I'm missing a finger or two), and I'm thrilled that this film might introduce some new people to his work. Even more, maybe more people will come to grips with the fact that Jesus not only doesn't mind their brokenness, but loves them right in the middle of it all. That would thrill Rich the most.",
         "This movie was recommended to me by a friend with whom I shared my feelings of spiritual \"wandering\" if you will; a believer with lots of questions and a feeling of emptiness that comes and goes. The acting was very good and the story honest. I am use to movies that lead to an obvious conclusion, however, this movie wasn't the typical countdown to an epiphanic moment. Rather, it was exactly what I needed in realizing I am not alone in my struggles for meaning. Wear comfortable clothes because this movie is a bit long. My rating of \"8\" out of 10 is relative to movies of this category. This film should not be compared to Hollywood blockbusters, and justifiably so; the film is a message to each viewer who wishes to receive. The feature was not, in my opinion, made to entertain but more importantly to potentially impact your life in a far greater way than even the most popular movies ever could. Enjoy.",
         "The storyline is simple enough � the life of Rich Mullins. He is the author of the song \"Awesome God\" as well as hundreds of others. He was part of a resurgence of contemporary Christian music movement in the 80\u2032s and 90\u2032s - a culture he would come to hate and leave. The film documents his struggles with his faith, addictions and insecurities while his songs were some of the most popular in the world of contemporary Christian music. If you are looking for a nice, neat film with a simple conflict/resolution arch of a story � Ragamuffin isn't for you. Ragamuffin is a dark, brooding film that exposes the insecurity and grit of Rich Mullins' faith. It's messy. It doesn't resolve. It's redemptive and agonizing. All of which I think is authentic to Rich as well as his God. The acting and cinematography are top shelf. Michael Koch delivers an incredible performance of being true to Rich's eccentric, authentic faith without pushing the performance into a sappy mess of emotion. The movie has it all - great acting, great filming, and great storytelling. Highly recommend it. And stay for the credits for real footage of Rich.",
         "I knew and met Rich several times when I was a Christian Concert Promoter. I have mourned his loss for a very long time. I agree with one reviewer who said that the film was rather dark and perhaps some of our darkness reflects in the film so that makes it darker. I do wish that there was a little more of his quick humored funniness that came out in the movie, but I think I understand why it didn't as much. For one reason, it was done through the eyes of close family. They hurt for his hurts and probably are closer to that at times. Especially when he's gone and you were unable to fix it for him. Second because so few saw the struggles he had which just increases the realness and the authenticity of how God works with us. But let me say this. He was an amazing profound and deep poet. He was a saint who related to Christ's sufferings equally to his blessings and in doing so almost always seemed to be directly dialed to him. Second, he had huge talent! Third he had a truly sacrificial heart! He was amazing! Lastly, I thought I would hate the film any way because after all who could ever be Rich ? Even pretend or act to be Rich? I enjoyed the film more than I thought I would. I think they did a good job that was one of the toughest. When you play Lincoln or George Washington. There aren't too many people around to know how they were in real life. I would say they did as good as they could and it was awesome and entertaining and moving! It even touched my life as a father to my kids. Was it as good as seeing Rich do Rich? Well, it was the next best thing, but wish I had more time with him. He was once in a life! Love you Rich! See this movie. You'll not regret it!",
         "I am a big fan of Rich Mullins, I have all his albums, and have been to several of his concerts, so when I saw this movie I quickly bought it. I have to say for a man who wanted his legacy to be one of joy, this movie presented him in such a depressing way. I know he was a flawed man, a lot of his songs reflect his (and our) struggle with being like Christ and living for him, but the makers of this movie seemed to dwell so much on his flaws (was he an alcoholic?) that it took away from the joy he had in writing music, singing, ministering to children and teens and sharing the love of God with others. The continuity was terrible, one minute he had short hair, the next he had long ugly, unkempt hair and that was a big distraction in watching this movie. In all the interviews and pictures I have ever seen him in, he never seemed to look as disheveled as the movie depicts him. Yes some of his music was introspective and dark, but a lot of it was whimsical, joyful and hopeful like, Pictures in the Sky, and With the Wonder, and so many were truly inspiring like, If I Stand. I didn't know the man personally as did some of the contributors including his own brother, but from what I have read about him and seen of him in concerts and interviews, and just listening to his music, he deserved so much better than this sad depiction of his life.",
         "Rich Mullins relentlessly pursued Jesus in his own life, of which fact this movie is not ashamed. However, the movie does not portray Rich as larger than life. Rather, we meet an enigmatic man who wrestled with rejection from his father and from the love of his life. While striving to live in obedience to the commands of Christ, he struggled with sin and often confused those closest to him. His struggles did not subside but rather were compounded by his own musical success as he lived with the emptiness that still remained. Unlike in many Christian movies, sin and rejection are not something that an unsaved person or lapsed Christian is ceremoniously delivered from, but are an expected part of living in this world. Overall, I would give the acting an 8/10; it's not Hollywood, but it's not bad either. I would give the writing a 7/10, as the dialog seems contrived and heavy-handed in a few places. Fortunately, this happens seldom and the writing is overall pretty believable. For production and cinematography, I would give it 8/10; again, this isn't Hollywood, but it's great for an indie film. From a historical accuracy standpoint, I would give it 7/10. There are a few occasions where locations of events and names of people (even those closest to Rich) were changed, but overall it seems pretty accurate. Other reviews have also mentioned one particular anachronism, i.e. that musical instruments/equipment are seen years before they were invented; the reason for this is that the concert scenes in the movie were filmed live at Mitch McVicker concerts in 2012. Having a limited budget, this movie had to make do with what it could get. As for the accuracy of the details of Rich's life: Given that many of those working on the movie were close to Rich (such as Mitch McVicker, and his brother David Mullins), I have no reason to doubt overall account of his personal life. Rich's music features prominently into this movie, and Michael Koch (himself a musician by trade, not an actor) does a pretty good job of approximating Rich's voice and re-creating his songs. Don't be disappointed if your favorite Mullins song is not featured, though; it's only a two-hour fifteen-minute movie! ****Spoilers Ahead**** This film is quite open about Rich's faults: His struggle with alcoholism, his chain-smoking habit, his struggle to be accepted by his father, his hapless pursuit of his love interest, and his highly dependent relationship with Beaker (whose name was changed in the film). Twice in the movie he chides Beaker for leaving his vicinity for mere minutes to perform mundane tasks (such as getting a cup of coffee from the hotel lobby). One gets the sense that Rich, for all of his shameless demonstration of the love of Jesus on many occasions, was excessively dependent on those closest to him. It is also interesting what the film chooses to focus on and chooses to ignore. For example, while the Order of the Kid Brothers of Saint Frank is described, the Ragamuffin Band doesn't get a mention. Also conspicuously absent are the details of Rich's experience on the reservation and his interest in Catholicism. But this movie does focus well on the aspects of Rich's life that it chooses to explore. In the end, this is a story about a man who is deeply enveloped in loneliness and rejection, but who finds his solace and comfort in learning to love and obey the God who made him. As he is ignored by his fiancée' in the midst of his burgeoning success,telephone calls home seeking comfort are welcomed by a tender mother but dismissed by a calloused father. One turning point for Rich in this story is his friendship with fellow alcoholic and ragamuffin author Brennan Manning. When Rich learns of the death of his father, with whom he was never really reconciled, he is devastated. Frequent flashbacks to the paternal castigation of Rich's childhood days still haunt the grown-up Rich, who feels like he never measured up in his father's eyes. He still has trouble viewing God as father, since his own father was so hard on him. Brennan leads Rich on a mini-retreat in which Rich writes a letter to himself from his father, and comes to realize that his father did truly love him, but that he had difficulty expressing that love verbally. The movie is also careful not to pit Rich Mullins as the hero against the Big Bad Christian Music Industry (as tempting as that might be). In one poignant scene, Rich gets in an argument with one of his producers at the record label. Although Rich seems to have some pretty valid points in the argument, the producer points out that Rich is being proud and disrespectful. In a subsequent scene, Rich begins mowing the producer's lawn early one morning as an act of reconciliation. This movie did a good job of helping to understand the man who wrote the music. It totally makes sense to me that the man who wrote \"Hold Me Jesus\" and \"Hard to Get\" would be the same guy who showed up drunk to a friend's funeral, threw a phone through a phone booth window when he learned of his ex-fiancée's engagement to another man, and struggled with deep-seated loneliness (Sadly, in some circles of Christian piety, admitting that one is lonely brings forth accusations that one does not have a close walk with God, or that one may not even know Christ at all). Although some might lose faith in Rich upon learning these facts, I think Rich would have been okay with that. He would have wanted us to put our faith in Jesus instead. Rich often alluded to his own struggles with sin and temptation in his concerts. While not going into a lot of personal detail, he never pretended to be anything other than a ragamuffin in God's Kingdom.",
         "Overall, I was pleased with the honesty of the film. There was a darkness in his soul similar to Mother Teresa's spiritual darkness. That pain certainly came out in his music and is the big reason I listened to him then and still today. Love was not just a feeling. I was disappointed they skipped his exploration of Catholicism considering the rest of the honesty in the film, but they did pay homage to St. Francis. The Brennan Manning scenes were powerful. Michael Koch sang/played the music believably and his acting was above average. It was a nice touch to have Mitch McVicker in the film. Sometimes on these Christian films the acting can be sub par, but I did not see it here. The film runs 2.5 hours and they could have cut it down some, but I didn't feel bored, and the people I went with cried at the more emotional scenes. That tells me that they were certainly engaged. I would recommend the film and encourage people to rediscover his music.",
         "I prepared for the worst, worried that \"Ragamuffin\" might be a fanboy flick with nothing new to add to the story of Rich Mullins. I hoped for the best, believing that the film might open a window into the inner life of a musician and Christian who has influenced my life. The end result was somewhere in between. The cinematography is good, the acting is decent, but the father-son conflict and romantic-interest only propel the movie for about 45 minutes before the story gets stuck in a long middle section detailing Rich's slow rise in Nashville. The sense of time and place begins to get hazy as characters are given little introduction or time to develop, and the original dramatic thread runs out. If you knew nothing of Rich Mullins, you'd likely be puzzled by the movie's tag line, \"His life was a whirlwind,\" as Rich spends much of it lying in bed emotionally distraught or staring into mirrors. If you're a die-hard Rich Mullins fan, there is little new here. Most of Rich's dialogue is taken directly from concert/interview transcripts and available source materials, but delivered without the characteristic \"Rich\" humor and bite. During the credits, brief footage of Rich speaking in concert is shown. This was the most compelling moment of the film. I applaud the \"Ragamuffin\" team's effort, I support bringing the life and music of Rich Mullins to a wider audience, but for the most part, \"Ragamuffin\" just didn't work as a film. If you're interested in exploring the life of Rich Mullins, you are better off browsing his YouTube videos or reading his concert transcripts and interviews.",
         "This is a very powerful and gripping movie about the life of Rich Mullins. It is not just another \"life story\" about a famous person. It not only shows Rich's life but it ministers to all who see it. It not only brought tears to my eyes throughout the movie, but to the people throughout the church at that showing. I would recommend everyone to see this movie because it brings you to the realization that God loves all of us, even though we are not perfect. It is definitely a must see, powerful,inspiring, enlightening, and ministering movie for Christians and non-Christians alike. If you only purchase one DVD this year, it should be Ragamuffin!"
