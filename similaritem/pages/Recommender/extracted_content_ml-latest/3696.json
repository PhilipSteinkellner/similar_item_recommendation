         "content": "What is this? A homicide, or a bad B-movie?\r\n\r\nNot exactly what you would call an unknown horror comedy, but there is the distinct feeling that it should be better known. As its cult fan base will attest, this is blast of a movie, a homage to the \"B\" schlockers of lore. Directed by Fred Dekker, the premise sees some alien beings eject a flask of alien slugs down to earth, which lands at a fraternity campus, something which cause mayhem some years later when a frozen body is disturbed at the medical lab and the slugs are unleashed. Cue infestation that turns people into zombies!\r\n\r\nThe pic plays up to the clich√©s of fraternity based movies, with nerds and nudity on tap, all smothered in a gooey horror comedy sauce. One-liners are ripe, the characterisations also, the latter of which fronted by a glorious Tom Atkins as a hard drinking hard - boiled detective with issues and quips ready to be poured out. It's not genius film making, but given the low budget it deserves its cult status, because it never pauses for breath and it's very aware of what it wants to be - and crucially who its target audience is. 7/10",

      "synopsis": "In 1959, on board a space ship, two aliens race to keep an experiment from being released by a third member of the crew. The seemingly possessed third alien shoots the canister into space where it crashes to Earth. Nearby, a college man takes his date to a parking spot when they see a falling star and investigate. Unfortunately, it lands in the path of an escaped criminally insane mental patient. As his date is attacked by the axe-wielding maniac, the boy finds the canister, from which a small leech-like thing jumps out and into his mouth. 28 years later, Chris Romero is pining over a love lost, being supported by his handicapped friend J.C. During pledge week at Corman University, Chris spots a girl, Cynthia Cronenberg, and seems to fall instantly in love. To get her attention, he decides that he must join a fraternity. As a part of their pledge (although the frat leader who is dating Cynthia has no intentions of letting them join), they must steal a cadaver from the university medical center and place it on the steps of the Phi Omega Gamma house. Chris and J.C. find one in a top secret room that is being kept in a state of suspended animation, but when it grabs one of their arms as they try to move it, they lose their nerve and run back to their dorm room. Meanwhile, Detective Ray Cameron, a cop that dated the girl killed back in 1959 and is haunted by the memories of what he found that night, is called in to the cryogenics lab break-in where there were two bodies, but one is now missing. The missing body is the one released from its cryogenics tomb - the same boy who found the alien experiment back in 1959. This missing body makes its way back to the same sorority house where he picked up his date 27 years earlier. The walking corpse comes to Cynthia's window where his head splits open and more of the leech creatures fall out and slither across the ground. Called to the scene, Ray finds the body with a large open wound in the face, similar to one that could have been made by an axe. The next day, Chris and J.C. are confronted by the frat brothers, upset over the fact that they believe they are responsible for the previous night's incident. After surviving their encounter, they are then taken in for questioning by the police. Based on the testimony of a janitor that witnessed them running out of university medical center, \"screaming like banshees,\" they confess to breaking in, but deny taking the corpse out. That night, the attendant found dead gets up from his slab and runs into the same janitor. After the dead and buried cat of one of the sorority sisters comes back, Cynthia confesses it to Chris and J.C. and goes on about the dead body found at the sorority house. Although both are skeptical of her story about them being zombies, J.C. sees that she is leaning on Chris' shoulder, and leaves the two alone to go to the bathroom, where the now-possessed janitor enters and lets loose more of the slugs. As Chris walks Cynthia back to the sorority house, he runs into Cameron who has overheard the entire story. Back at Ray's home, the two talk about their high school sweethearts. Ray's story is more elaborate as he goes on about how they broke up and he became a cop and how he was called out to the site where she had been hacked up by a lunatic. He goes on to tell of how he tracked down the escaped patient, killed him and buried him in the same spot on which the House Mother's cottage now sits. Just then, Ray gets a call where the House Mother has been hacked up to death by the axe-wielding corpse that broke in through the floor. The killer is finally tracked down and cornered by the police, but numerous gunshots have no effect. Cameron then takes his shotgun and blows its head off, which releases more of the little creeps. The next night, everyone is getting ready for the formal when Chris notices a tape recorder on which J.C. has recorded a posthumous message to his friend, telling him that one of the things has incubated in his brain and that he had discovered, after lighting one with a match, that heat can destroy them. Chris then runs into the boiler room, where his friend has told him he was headed in an attempt to kill those inside him. Chris then shows up at Ray's place, which Ray has sealed up, and he fills him in. After grabbing his gun and turning off the gas, he takes Chris to a police armory to get a flamethrower. They come to the sorority house just as Cynthia is breaking up with Brad who has become possessed. After killing him, the Delta fraternity brothers show up - despite having been killed in a bus crash. While Chris and Cynthia team up with shotgun and flamethrower to destroy the dead outside, Cameron does likewise inside. After stopping the horde, Chris spots more slugs racing across the ground that are headed into the house's basement. Cynthia remembers that this is where specimen brains are being kept. When they go down below, they find Cameron, tape across his mouth, prepping a can of gasoline. They also find the creatures gathered in a huge swarm in the corner. Cameron begins counting down as he splashes gasoline everywhere. Cynthia and Chris turn and run out of the house, counting down in sync with Cameron. Cameron fills the basement with gas and just as some of the parasites leap at him, he flicks his lighter and the house goes up in a fiery explosion. Watching the sorority house burn, Chris and Cynthia share a kiss. The scene ends when the dog that caused the bus accident returns, opens its mouth, and a slug jumps out.",

         "After an \"experiment\" is accidentally released from a spaceship in a tube, it crashes on Earth where it infects a youth in the 1950s. Flash forward to the mid 1980s, and the youth is now cryogenically frozen in a university lab for study. At least until Chris Romero (Jason Lively) and J.C. Hooper (Steve Marshall) release him, and he begins infecting countless members of a small college town. Director and writer Fred Dekker, who has had a lamentably short career as a helmer, wrote Night of the Creeps in seven days. He told himself that if he did not get to the end of the script by that self-imposed deadline, the whole thing would go into the garbage. If this is what one can come up with in such a flurry, maybe more scripts should have time limits. We should also be glad that he sold the script with a caveat: if he wasn't allowed to helm the film, he wasn't going to sell it. He's said that he didn't care if it sold or not at the time. Why Dekker has received so little recognition and respect in the industry is difficult to say. Night of the Creeps didn't have the wide release and promotion that it deserved, especially given its $5 million budget (it's curious that TriStar didn't push more to make its money back). Both this film and Dekker's 1987 effort, The Monster Squad, are currently only available on bootleg DVDs in the U.S. Night of the Creeps is one of the better horror/comedies of the 1980s. The script is clever, paying homage to everything from 1950s sci-fi horror to the zombie craze started by George Romero to 1980s slasher films and even John Hughes. Just in case one couldn't catch the homage angle, Dekker has a lot of character and place names that are tributes to various genre directors. Dekker's dialogue is witty and memorable--there are a few classic diatribes in the film that would be worthwhile and a lot of fun to memorize. Dekker's writing is self-conscious and self-mocking, predating Scream (1996) by 10 years (there is actually a whole class of 1980s and early 1990s flicks that were doing everything Scream was credited with revolutionizing). Dekker is not afraid to be joyously silly, as with genre character actor favorite Tom Atkins' response when asked if he's Detective Cameron--\"No, Bozo the Clown\". Dekker even gives us the 1980s high school classic of the hand-cranked middle finger. But Night of the Creeps isn't just a comedy. The serious horror aspects of Night of the Creeps are extremely well done. The film is suspenseful, the effects are good, and there is plenty of gore for fans. Dekker could have easily made an effective retro horror film--most of the first five minutes are set in the 1950s, shot in black and white, and have an authentic feel, with just a dash of tongue in its cheek. He smoothly transitions from The Blob (1958) and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)-styled sci-fi (with heavy Alien (1979) touches) to early 1980s slasher material, then to a more complex and fantastic collage of zombies, slugs and detectives seeking revenge. While the film isn't likely to be appreciated by those who dislike mixing their horror with comedy, and especially won't be appreciated by viewers who don't even realize that it's supposed to also be a comedy, neither type is very likely to watch it in the first place--at least not for long. For those with the appropriate mindset and love of horror (it's a lot more fun if one is familiar with everything being referenced), Night of the Creeps is a gem that deserves better recognition. We should at least be able to buy it on an official DVD (and please put both endings on the disc).",
         "\"Night of the Creeps\" is definitely one of the better B-movies that are out there. Granted, like all B-movies it's a bit hokey at times, and also follows along the trademark lines with films of this caliber (obligatory boob shot, corny dialogue, poor camera techniques, etc.). But give \"Night of the Creeps\" its due. First of all, it is fairly original for a B-movie. Alien slugs that infest the brain and turn you into a zombie may seem like a typical B-movie theme, but it's portrayed in a fairly unique manner. Given the time period of this movie's release, and it's obviously small budget, I'm quite impressed with the special-effects of the alien slugs as they race along the ground throughout the film. They're so simple, that it makes them look realistic and somewhat unnerving. In horror films, it is often the most simple effects that are the most discomforting to the viewer. I put these alien slugs along that line. I really like Tom Atkins (\"Lethal Weapon\") as Detective Cameron too. He's the perfect actor for this particular role as the washed-up detective. Unfortunately or perhaps fortunately for Tom's career, it seems that he often got type-cast to play the depressed, on-edge characters. Atkins is one of the bonuses in this B-flick. Another \"acting bonus\" would have to be our two young heroes played by Jason Lively (\"European Vacation\") and Jill Whitlow. Lively as always plays the young, likable clod. Somewhat bashful, somewhat moronic, somewhat accident-prone, but you can't help but like the guy. And Whitlow is just plain cute. I sometimes think that 80's flicks didn't have enough cute girls in them, but Whitlow is definitely one of them. All in all, \"Night of the Creeps\" is good for a B-movie. It'll entertain you for sure, and you won't get sick of it while you're watching. It's definitely one to watch if you're into the B-movie thing.",
         "For the genre, this film is outstanding. It has absolutely everything a horror film should. This includes a performance by Tom Atkins that is worthy of serious recognition. Zombies, exploding heads, creepy crawlies and a date for the formal. Like I said this ones got it all. Alien experiment is jettison from space and lands in Anytown USA where it releases a slug like creature that wants to get in your mouth and lay eggs in your brain. The movie begins black and white set in the early 60s, which is an awesome touch by the way, and then jumps ahead to the mid eighties where were treated to a sorority gals, frat nazis, a couple of pledge geeks(our heroes), Tom Atkins cop on the edge(who delivers some of the best lines in cinema history,i.e.\"Duck! It's Miller Time!\" Exploding heads aplenty, flamin'zombies, a great lawnmower kill, zombie cat, zombie dog, a parapelegic whos faster on crutches then his able friend, and a hilarious janitor who has only one repeating line. NOTC is everything you want from a film, a perfect 10!",
         "Wow! I must say that I grew up in the 80's, and had never before heard of this film when it came out, initially. My guess would be that it played in very brief, limited release, or was a product of a \"straight-to-video\" release. In either case, a tragedy. I discovered this film, late one night, while watching Cinemax. I saw that it was from 1986, and starred Jason Lively, who I vaguely remembered from National Lampoon's European Vacation. I never gave much of a second thought to his performance in that film, but he was surprisingly decent here. Since I am an avid Horror film fan, and this was a product of the 80's that I was not at all familiar with, it picqued my curiosity. So, I decided to give this one a try, and am so glad that I chose to do so. What a refreshing little gem this was to discover. I can't believe I had never heard anything about it before, one way or another. A great little \"B-movie\", that does not take itself too seriously. This film has it all: terrific writing, impressive acting, (especially Tom Atkins), zombies, creepy slugs, an ax-murderer, aliens, fraternity studs, sorority babes, as well as, lovable lonely dorks. This would make an excellent double feature, along with Re-Animator. I only hope that this film will, one day, get to see the light of day, and be given a royal DVD release, (hint, hint, Anchor Bay). Do not miss an opportunity to see this one, if you can.",
         "Viewing this particular film as a straight horror movie is a mistake. When I first saw this film (in 1989 or so) I thought it was a terrible horror movie and shut it off about half way through. I was under the impression it was a straight up zombie movie from the box art. There where some attempts at humor that fell flat. My problem was I was expecting \"Dawn of the Dead\" (or at least Day). On second enconter (around 1995) I laughed myself silly. I got the joke. The script is actually a joyous tribute to 50's-80's \"B-Movies\", Mad science, aliens, couples necking in a convertable (in black and white no less) and a catchphrase spewing hard boiled gumshoe. With out the preconceived notions I found this film quite charming. While not the best of the comedy/horror mix (Scream, American Werewolf in London...) this is a decent attempt at the cross-genre and best enjoyed with freinds.",
         "This movie is so super cool. I love this movie. Even though the stars are like second - billing , this movie is still like no other - its original all in it's own right. Had to be a drive - in film from the looks of the release date. Wish I seen it there! If you have a slug in you , on you or around you - to say the least - you're totally bumming. 80s comedy - horror at its best. Makes you laugh and scares you into jumping out of your seat. Spooky. Funny and different make this a favorite of mine...and maybe yours! I rate this 9 / 10",
         "Chris and J.C. are to college geeks. They are always the brunt of the jokes and always ready to give back a quick tongue lashing. When Chris takes a shine to one of the sorority girls both Chris and J.C. have to perform a hazing prank so they can join the fraternity and win his fair maiden. The boys are sent to the campus morgue to get a body but through a series of fowl ups reanimate a cryogenically frozen body that has an alien parasite residing in its body. It seems these parasites enter your mouth and take over your body whether you're dead or alive. Hilarity ensues as Chris and a police detective attempt to save the campus then the world. Night of the Creeps is one seriously fun film. A mixture of1950's sci-fi films mixed with some zombie action and a lot of humor. Night of the Creeps is a gem that needs to be revived in the DVD age. Tom Atkins is the highlight as the foul-mouthed and sarcastic detective that accompanies Chris during the debacle.",
         "As i sat with baited breath. Holding in my hand my newly acquired copy of Fred Dekker's directorial debut \"Night Of the Creeps\" i pondered to myself. I had first watched this wonderful little Sciience fiction horror masterpiece way back upon it's first release on video tape in 1986. Could the movie still carry such a lofty reputation as it had done all those years since i had last watched it as a teenager hooked on horror movies. Well of course the answer was an unprecedented yes. Still as fresh and funny second time around. Memories lingered in my mind of the many scenes and hip and happening dialogue that sprung forth from the many characters that wandered through this little gem. As we fade in, we find ourselves transported to an alien spaceship travelling through the galaxy, two little aliens carrying zapper guns chasing a third, who as it happens is possessed by something sinister and is about to launch a canister containing a lethal parasite off the spaceship and off into the unknown and so it begins. Star of the show for me has to be Tom Atkins playing yet again another one of those grizzled cops, who in his time on the force has seen it, done it, could write a book about it. However for once, unlike his role in \"Maniac Cop\" He is given many wonderful lines of hard boiled dialogue to chew on. Ably assisted by a then young and unknown group of young actors, Jason Lively who would later take the lead in one of Roland Emmerich's first movies \"Ghost Chase\" Also look out for the actress Suzanne Syder way before \"The Return Of The Living Dead 2\" and \"Killer Klowns From Outer Space\" in a small and very brief cameo. Stranger to think that Fred Dekker's career appears to have found it's way into television land, sit back and scream like a banshee at this truly fast and furious romp form the 1980's Then think about this, why can't they make them like this anymore Without any hesitation, 10 out of 10!",
         "Fred Dekker directs this somewhat forgotten, low-budget horror spoof from the 80's. Dekker treats the material liberally and never tries to make the movie anything more than a fun B movie going for laughs. Although not always an easy thing to do, Dekker and his virtual cast of unknowns pulls it off rather nicely. The story begins with a wonderfully filmed flashback in the 1950's where we see something fall from the sky passing overhead the boys and girls parked at a \"Lookout\" type place. Unfortunately whilst this goes on, an ax murderer has escaped the asylum in that very vicinity. Now you might think what do these two things possibly have to do with each other, but Dekker the screenwriter pulls that off as well as the film jumps to the present 1980's and we meet two lovable(OK, maybe not so lovable) losers, one with a pair of crutches and cracking wise constantly and the other newly lovesick with a young lady he has just seen from across the street. To spin a long tale short - these two want to join a fraternity to impress the girl, are asked to throw a cadaver on another fraternity's lawn, find a cryogenetically frozen body(from the 50's that had met with what fell from the sky), and all havoc breaks out as parasites in the brain begin to throw themselves from the cadaver's mouth to the mouths of others. Aside from mentioning Night of the Living Dead by name, Dekker's use of his walking dead pays on obvious homage to horror-meister George Romero. The film creates some interesting characters while again never taking anything serious. Tom Atkins, the Carpenter guy, plays a police detective that lost his girl back in the 50's to the ax murderer, and while I initially felt like he was over doing things early on with his over-blown performance, I found it working shortly after and realized the B movie 50's style effect he was going for. He carries it off wonderfully, and for me was easily the brightest spot in the film. While Night of the Creeps does have humour throughout, there are some genuine scares, lots of gore, and sustained pacing and suspense. For a little budget movie like this, it appears a lot of TLC was put into it - and it shows. As for the rest of the cast, Jason Lively plays romeo and Steve Marshall the sidekick. Both are pretty decent, and female lead Jill Whitlow, while not a particularly good or bad actress, is a banquet for the eyes.",
         "Tom Atkins, Jason Lively, Jill Whitlow and Steve Marshall star in Fred Dekker's 1986 horror film. This begins with an infected alien releasing a dangerous experiment off a spaceship into space. In 1959, A college couple go on a date and run into a cop, Ray Cameron who is actually the girl's ex-boyfriend. They're told that an escaped killer is on the loose and should go home. Instead, they try to find a shooting star and the girl gets hacked up by the killer while her boyfriend gets infected by the alien experiment in the woods that's really the shooting star. In 1986, Two college buddies, Chris Romero (Lively) and J.C. Hooper (Marshall) attempt a pledge prank and find the infected teen who has been frozen for 27 years. Chris also meets Cynthia Cronenberg (Whitlow) while detective Cameron (Atkins) investigates the bodies. He thinks they might have something to do with the killer who murdered his ex-girlfriend and shot years ago. J.C. doesn't make it, but Chris learns that the slugs infect their hosts turning them into zombies. Soon, Chris, Ray and Cynthia fight against them and the zombies. I finally watched this a few years ago and liked it since. Atkins is great as usual and steals the film. I also like how the film makes references to famous directors and has a nice little mix of sci-fi & b-movie elements added. I recommend this fun, campy 80's horror flick."
