         "It seemed (I thought) to be such a noble goal. To review all the movies on the Treeline Films DVD compilation '50 SciFi Classics'. And after 'The Incredible Petrified World', 'Queen of the Amazons' and 'Robot Monster'; to this bad film aficionado, it would also be most enjoyable. But then came 'She Gods of Shark Reef'. One can only imagine the good people at Treeline discovered the day before it released '50 SciFi Classics' that their collection only contained 49 films. So, in their need to find a filler fast, we end up with this non-SciFi film that was seemingly videotaped off a TV station whose reception you can only get by plugging the aerial into the toaster. Except, such a movie would never be played by one of those TV stations, due to its fear of losing an audience. Even the Treeline plot summary on the DVD sleeve gives you the tell tale sign that your in for a painful experience, as the best thing they can say at the beginning is 'Filmed in Hawaii'; which to my surprise, turned out to be a colour production process that seemingly gives this film a maximum of only 3 colour tones at any one time. I will not give you a plot synopsis as I strongly recommend you don't watch this film. It manages to find that special 'woeful' niche, where it's not bad enough to be enjoyable, yet hardly good enough to be watchable. However, I know that no matter how appalling it is, lessons can be drawn from a movie. The three lessons I learned from this film were: (1) its OK to hit a woman, provided she is fat and ugly (2) no matter how you film it, a dead shark looks very obviously like a dead shark, even if you push it to the intended shark attack victim, or drag it in the water to give the impression that its swimming (3) if there was an award for 'Smallest Killer Shark in Film', the poor little dead creature used here would win (and by more than a fin). In fact, if it were any smaller, it could easily be mistaken for krill. I have sacrificed myself to the She Gods so that you may forego the pain. I recommend that you take the opportunity instead to turn off the TV and go outside for a pleasant 70 minute walk and talk with a friend or loved one. The type of thing people probably did before the invention of film.",
         "Two men escape from police, only to be stranded on a corporate owned native island (?) where superstitious women worship a shark god. Mayhem and Hawaiian clothing ensue. As with many Roger Corman movies, I found this movie to be entertaining despite bottom of the barrel production values. He also paces the film reasonably, not wasting any time on unnecessary material. A very short running time results. However, I can only recommend it to Corman fans, or to fans of low budget tropical island movies. Those looking for horror or sci-fi won't find it here.",
         "I personally found this movie to be quite watchable compared to many others, especially useful as a late night movie, and I really do not see it as a bad movie at all with regard to either the acting or the way it was filmed, even regardless of some of the ludicrous concepts. You probably are familiar with the plot; two men, one \"good\", one \"bad\", end up on an island with exotic women and try to both kill each other and save one another at least once each. I don't understand the title, though, as there are NO \"she gods\" (whatever happened to \"goddess\", anyway?), only unseen \"shark gods\" (represented by an ugly idol) and an island full of women who collect (and protect) pearls for \"The Company\" (which we never learn much about or actually see, even though it is implied we will see them). One important thing that I learned from this movie is that it is okay to throw young girls into the ocean for the sharks to eat, as long as you report any suspicious strangers to the local police on the next island over! Weird! We are also supposed to believe that this \"queen\" (who oversees the sacrifices made to the shark gods) somehow is able to tell if anyone is correctly reading her maritime signal flag messages just by glancing into the horizon when you can't even see any other island! I'm also wondering how both Lee and Pua easily swam all the way back to the island with no trouble at all in those shark-infested waters! Anyway, the parts just prior to the ending were somewhat confusing and there ARE a couple of other incredibly dumb scenes. For example, the part where Queen Pua brags about having saved and taken care of Mahia, when she was the one who had thrown her to the sharks! She even cries about her sailing off away from her! Weird! The color on my DVD copy was fairly bad; the ocean kept changing between purples, greens, pinks, and blues, but the overall style and filming is somewhat attractive. 5/10. Not bad, not great. Again, it's fine for a late night watch before finally falling asleep.",
         "(Spoilers) \"She Gods of Sharks Reef\" is one of,if not the first, movie that Roger Corman made thats in color in the 1950's and that helps a lot in the very scenic scenes shot on land and under water in the film. Shot on location on the Hawaiian island of Kaga'l the movie is about two brothers Chris & Lee Johnston, Bill Cord & Don Durant, who get swept away in a violent typhoon in the South China Sea and end up some 300 miles off course at the all women island of Rara Tu. Chris was trying to save his criminal brother Lee from the authorities for a murder he committed in trying to raid an armory and steal a large amount of weapons. Taken on shore by the women of the island the two are given clothes food and water as well as the hospitably and company of the natives there. Told that a ship from the outside world will arrive in a few days to pick them up and bring them back home Chris & Lee realize that they'll be arrested and have to stand trial back on the mainland: Lee for murder and Chris for helping to escape and harboring a murderer. Finding a small ship on the island the two hide it in the under brush and plan to make their getaway but soon something happens that complicates their planes. The native God Tanga Roah who the people of the island feel is angry at them by having so much bad weather hit their island. To placate Tanga Roah over the last few weeks the natives have a number of young maidens sacrificed by taking them out to sea and then throwing them into the ocean to be eaten by sharks. Chris seeing this swims out and saves one of the maidens Maniah, Lisa Montell, to the bitter hostility of the Queen of island Queen Pua, (Jeanne Gerson) who feels that this would make Tanga Roah's anger even more ferocious. Back on land Mahia falls in love with Chris and plans to escape with him and Lee from the island since all thats waiting for her there is certain death as to being a sacrificial lamb for the angry God Tanga Roah. The criminally minded brother Lee has other ideas on not just escaping from the island but taking the many valuable pearls, hidden in the islands main building, thats been gathered up from the sea by the sea diving maidens and that in the end will lead to disaster for him. Not much of a story but the scenic color photography and the many underwater sequences, all original and not stock footage like you would have expected in a low budget movie like this, make it more then interesting and the beautiful, as well as courageous, young Mahia didn't hurt the film either.",
         "A simple, one-lined description of this movie would sound a little like: two guys wash ashore a tropical island exclusively inhabited by women that dive for pearls all day and worship ocean Gods� Terrific! Sounds like a movie many (male) exploitation fans would want to see. Or better yet, where can we go to book our very own holiday to this island? In reality, however, \"She Gods of Shark Reef\" is nothing but a good-looking package with absolutely no content. Roger Corman is one of the greatest and most important directors in (B-) movie history, but many of his obscure mini-budget productions of the late 50's really aren't worth bothering for. Movies like \"Creature from the Haunted Sea\", \"Attack of the Crab Monsters\" or this \"She Gods of Shark Reef\" were shot in a period of only a few days and without a real script, merely because Corman had a handful of extra dollars to spend and/or wanted to make more out of a certain filming location. The events take place in Hawaii and the beautiful images of this wonderful place are the ONLY reason to give this movie a glimpse. It's one of Corman's first movies shot in color and the place does look enchanting even though nothing really is happening there. The two male leads are supposed to be running from the law and the female leader of the island doesn't want them there, especially not since one of them is after her slave girls. The other guy is more interested in the shiny pearls, so needless to say he's not going to make it out alive. Or is he? You better not be expecting any vicious shark-attacks or virgin sacrifices, because you WILL feel cheated. The closest we come to an action sequence is when a native girl encourages the handsome blond guy to dance with her. Despite the gorgeous setting and promising (but misleading) title, this is one of the most boring films I ever watched. 63 minutes never lasted this long. Sorry, Roger�",
         "One way of looking at this movie is that it's one of the worst to come from its time and place. In this context, we see two young, good-looking hunks, both outlaws, who end up stranded on a tropical island inhabited by primitive hot white women who all speak broken English and cling to weird taboos and traditions, such as believing the sharks are gods, or some such nonsense. Another way of looking at this movie is that clever editing could have turned it into a touching story about two men who, while vacationing in Hawaii near the Hospital for Brain Damaged Women, discover just how attracted they are to each other soon after one of them tries to stop being gay by dating one of the native women. In this sense, one could consider this movie a well done piece of cinema history, especially since it was ahead of its time on the topic of civil rights. It is by imagining the latter scenario that this movie can be made entertaining enough to sit though. If you watch this by taking everything at face value, this flick is way too boring to finish. I'd say the only major motivation anyone would have to watch this movie is if they'd purchased some sort of boxed set that includes this, which is, incidentally, the only reason I watched it. The full synopsis goes like this: Two young, well-built dudes end up stranded on a Hawaiian beach and decide to never wear shirts again. They encounter a civilization of aforementioned broken English-speaking women led by a psychotic mother matron character who is obsessed with local tradition, which involves human sacrifice to appease the shark god. This means feeding a few of the young hotties to a mid-sized shark that may or may not be alive. One of the guys, Chris (Bill Cord) eventually falls in love with one of the native babes, Mahia (Lisa Montell), much to the irritation of Chris's ambiguously gay partner, Jim (Don Durant). Since the mother matron (Jeanne Gerson) is a nasty old woman who hates men, she decides to have Mahia sacrificed to the shark god to make herself feel better about neither Chris nor Jim finding her attractive. SHE GODS OF SHARK REEF: it's not the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's far from the best. The good news is that this sucker is, I do believe, public domain. Those who might search for it could possibly locate it online for free.",
         "Since the early 1950s, Roger Corman has been directing and releasing films at a break-neck pace. Typically, he tosses four or five into the arena per year. This explosive productivity, of course, limits the range of quality (and budgets) for his productions. However, Corman has only occasionally released really truly bad films. This is an example. Corman used the lovely islands of the Hawaiian Archipelago as a setting for this early color flatliner. If you have seen a few of his films, you know how important setting is to Corman. First - he never seems to have an adequate budget for his most ambitious projects, so he makes sure he films in visually interesting settings. Second - Corman often uses over-long and somewhat tedious pans (\"Corman pans\"). With nice scenery in the background, or a well designed set, the tedium factor for these shots is reduced. Corman's films are loaded with people moving from place to place, and \"She Gods\" is no exception. The film is about a pair of vaguely likable brothers. Chris (Bill Cord) is a fairly normal, if not particularly bright, young man. Lee (Don Durant) is his evil, and only slightly less intelligent, brother. Lee is a fugitive from the law. They find themselves shipwrecked on an island inhabited by a tribe of Polynesian Amazons lead by the not-very-creepy but still rather annoying Queen Pua (Jeanne Gerson). Lisa Montell plays Mahia (Lisa Montell), who fairly quickly becomes romantically entangled with Chris, but the gods of the shark reef have apparently made it clear that both men are taboo. Chris and Lee plot to escape, and decide to take Mahia along with them, but the shark gods have other plans. The acting is OK (with mediocre camera-work occasionally making the actors appear to be over-acting), the pace is as good as some of Corman's better works, the script is thankfully spartan, and the plot is as thin as a fish scale. The Hawaiian dancing and singing, underwater swimming scenes, shark-fight action and lovely costumes don't really succeed in making up for the virtually nonexistent story-line, middling cinematography and weakly developed main characters. Plus, some of the shark scenes (I believe one is repeated twice in the film) are laughable. Can't really recommend this.",
         "There seems to be general agreement that \"She Gods\" is woefully deficient in such areas as plot, character, and dialog. Kind words have been said, however, about the colorful Hawaiian scenery. The movie also offers another kind of visual attraction: beefcake. Co-stars Bill Cord and Don Durant spend virtually the entire movie dressed in nothing more than good suntans and micro-mini-sarongs. Unfortunately, these sarongs are worn so high around the waist -- God forbid audiences should get a glimpse of the actors' navels! -- that the actors' physiques sometimes look awkwardly proportioned with too much attention given to their thighs. However, their bare chests look quite good, especially in the close-ups, and these chests are seen so frequently that the actors' nipples soon become something like old friends. However, one wonders why one brother (Bill Cord) is blond with some hair on his chest while the other (Don Durant) has black hair and virtually no hair on his chest. One might also wonder what directions these actors received for those scenes in which they have to sit cross-legged in those mini-sarongs while still preserving their modesty. Also, note how well-combed and well-oiled their hairstyles are, no matter what the circumstances.",
         "What will stick out most in this low budget affair is that it truly is low budget. You can tell not much is spent in this story of a prison escape of two men, aided by the brother of one, to meet with a hurricane, and get stranded on an island of beautiful women who fish for pearls in shark infested waters. But Corman does a good job of keeping things fresh. This is a \"cheese\" film, make no mistake, and was meant to showcase a pair of hunks and a few gorgeous gals. You can tell no money is wasted. But we don't mind that we don't see a ship torn apart by a hurricane. Only the most hopeless of dorks would complain about the lack of special effects, so long as the story is told. There could have been more organization, however. The credits I saw on utube don't even begin to match the names of the characters. If you look at the credits while watching the movie, you'll go \"Huh?\". And the bad brother is a bit cliché in his consistent evil doings. May as well let him muse over taking over the world with James Bond as a nemesis. Still, the ending is totally unpredictable, particularly for Corman, and particularly for modern audiences. One has to be fairly impressed that Corman can at least keep from giving us a cliché to end this one.",
         "1956 was an extraordinarily prolific year for director Roger Corman. It saw the filmmaker complete no less than eight (8!) pictures, including four that would prove among his most popular: \"It Conquered the World,\" \"Attack of the Crab Monsters,\" \"Not of This Earth\" and \"The Undead.\" Toward the end of the year, Corman & Co. repaired to the Hawaiian island of Kauai and shot two films simultaneously: \"Thunder Over Hawaii\" and \"She Gods of Shark Reef.\" Hardly on the same level as those other four films, the first was a tale of modern-day pirates, and the latter a story about two brothers, one a murderer on the lam, who are stranded on an island (in the Philippines or Indonesia, the viewer must infer) that is populated solely by pearl-diving women. These gals are ruled by a shrill-voiced termagant in a muumuu, and worship the sharks that infest the local reef. (No viewer, apparently, has ever been able to figure out who the titular \"she gods\" are!) Ultimately released in 1958, the film is a fun little \"B picture\" that, at 63 minutes, flies by fairly quickly. Corman has since been quoted as saying, in reference to these Hawaiian productions, \"Visually, these two movies are probably the most beautiful I've ever shot.\" Sadly, you'd never know it by looking at this DVD from the never-dependable Alpha Video. Colors look completely washed out and blurry (although not quite as egregiously as on this company's DVD of Corman's \"Swamp Women\"!) and the sound is horrendous, often buried under the crash of perpetually booming surf. Indeed, this DVD looks so very crummy that it is almost impossible for a viewer to imagine \"She Gods\" in a \"beautiful\" pristine state, as theatre goers must have seen it 50 years ago. I cannot conceive of anyone but a die-hard Corman completist finding any satisfaction from this dismal-looking product. Thanks again, Alpha Video!"

         "Two men escaping the police by ship are blown off course by a typhoon and shipwrecked on an uncharted island populated by women who make a living diving for pearls. What the men don't know is that the women are also part of a shark cult that sacrifices young virgins to the sharks in the surrounding ocean in order to appease the shark gods.",
         "Chris Johnson helps his brother Jim, who is a fugitive on a murder charge, to escape from the law on his boat. They are shipwrecked on a reef near a supposed uninhabited island but are pulled from the shark-filled waters by Mahia, one of a group of sarong-clad, nubile beauties living there. Their leader, Queen Pua, tells them that they will have to wait for a company supply boat to take them away. After Chris saves Mahia from being sacrificed to the shark-gods by Queen Pua and Jim steals the Queen's cache of pearls, the men try to make good their escape with a stolen canoe.",
