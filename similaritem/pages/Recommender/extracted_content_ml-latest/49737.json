      "synopsis": "Martial arts legend Jackie Chan stars as Jack, a world-renowned archaeologist who has begun having mysterious dreams of a past life as a warrior in ancient China. When a fellow scientist asks for Jack's help in locating the mausoleum of China's first emperor, the past collides violently with the present as Jack discovers his amazing visions are based in fact. Assisted by the spirit of a noble princess, Jack follows a mystical trail that soon finds him battling the forces of the legendary emperor, as well as the henchmen of a modern-day tomb raider, as he seeks to uncover histor's greatest secret - and his own destiny. Martial arts legend Jackie Chan stars in this mystical, fantasy adventure as an intrepid archaeologist, Jack, who sets out on an adventure that would lead to the greatest discovery in Chinese history. In BC221 Qin Shihuang the first emperor of China started to build a royal tomb for himself despite his infatuation with immortality. Through the prodigious endeavors of more than 700,000 forced labourers, the mausoleum was completed 37 years later. Legend has it that to ensure utmost secrecy, all those who worked on the project were buried alive with the dead emperor. Over the next 2,000 years historians, tomb-raiders and happy-go-lucky adventurers alike had been homing in on the royal treasure, however, no one had ever succeeded in location the entrance to the mausoleum until now. [D-Man2010] This wild tale showcases Jackie Chan's skills and charm as he plays both Meng Yi, a Qin Dynasty general, and as the same character's reincarnation, Jack Lee. Lee is an archaeologist, but spends much of his time experiencing strange memories from his past life. With an unusual and complex plot that interweaves many disparate elements, this is certainly a departure from Chan's typical work. [D-Man2010]",

         "This film was pretty hyped up for many reasons. Jackie Chan, after the relatively successful return to HK movie industry with the release of New Police Story, teams up once again with Stanley Tong (Rumble in the Bronx) for starters. Tong wrote the story of The Myth, casting Jackie Chan in a never seen before role (yes, audiences are tired with his cop roles already) as a Qin dynasty general. What's refreshing too is that the role requires the use of a real weapon (a sword in this case), rather than having JC's character improvising with tools from his environment. As most would already know from the trailer and poster, JC plays Jack Chan (about time they come up with better names too), an archaeologist who dreams about a Korean princess whom he's escorting to the Qin emperor as his new concubine. It's a recurring dream, and before you can say \"Indiana Jones\", he's off to locales he sees in his dream world to try and unravel its mystery, while research companion Tony Leung (The Lover) irks him along the way with tomb raiding in the name of scientific studies. The story, while it might be original for a Jackie Chan movie, seemed a little cliché. It plays like a young boy's fantasy of snagging that exotic oriental princess, enjoying the support of the troop masses, having utmost loyalty to the king, and blessed with good fighting skills topped with a signature sword. And with the Qin dynasty, you're usually reduced to plots which may include the Great Wall, beautiful consorts, or the pill of Immortality. The Myth looks and feels like a classic JC movie in terms of production values, like the familiar fight-with-the-baddies-acrobatic-stunts scenes, and physical humour injected at certain points. However, I guess with JC's age, the number of fight scenes have been reduced, and somewhat slowed down deliberately. The fight at the Rat Glue Factory stood out for being a combination of both brawn and injected situational humour. On the other hand, The Myth signifies new developments in a typical JC storyline, with the introduction of drama-mama romance (nothing much romantic though, with being comatose in all the good bits and lots of lingering stares), and a surprise(?) epilogue for his Qin character. And the \"No blood no sex\" unofficial clause goes out the window too. Despite its huge budget, the special effects were not refined, which was a pity. The \"blue screen\" effect is obvious, even to the untrained eye, and there were a tad too many \"lazy extras\" who, in wide angled, supposedly big epic fight scenes, just stood, danced, moved around, anything but fight realistically. The original Highlander perfected the art of transitioning between flashbacks and present time, while The Myth falters, looking seemingly forced and contrived at times, or opted for the cheap way out - the blackouts. As with most JC films, the women here play \"flower vases\". But I'm not complaining. Kim Hee-seon was beautiful in her role as the princess, and in the blooper reel, she was actually speaking Mandarin, and having a hard time remembering her lines. Mallika Sherawat was sizzling as she dandied around in flimsical dresses, while executing those high kicks, and I guess the entire run up to the Rat Glue Factory might turn out to be a fan favourite. Many in the audience were surprised when the characters started speaking in Cantonese (for settings in modern day Hong Kong), and the local censors had no issue with that, instead of dubbing over the lines with Mandarin. Now that's a thumbs up. So enjoy The Myth for what it is, just don't expect too much from a simple predictable storyline, and for some illogical and improbable scenes (I can't stand the horse back-kicking bits) that plays out like Michelle Yeoh's The Touch or even JC's own The Medallion.",
         "Ever since Jackie Chan's rendezvous with Hollywood in Cannonball Run (1981) (which incidentally was advertised in Hong Kong as Jackie \"co-starring with Bert Reynolds\"), he has been true to his unique brand of action � part comedy, part choreography, part acrobat � but never true martial arts such as what Jet Li delivers. (A remote analogy of the Sphinx � part woman, part beast, part god - but nothing of a man in it). And this went on for what seem like an eternity, both in local and Hollywood productions. Then, approaching mid-life, Chan started to try new things � e.g. pure romance in \"Bo lei jun\" (or \"Glass bottle\") (1999) and pathos in \"New Police story\" (2004). In \"The Myth\", he takes things even further, by giving us both an old clowning around Jackie Chan and a new all serious Jackie Chan, in two parallel stories, present and ancient. Good intentions and efforts notwithstanding, Chan's portrayal of a general of woeful countenance in the ancient Qin dynasty is just not convincing, maybe because of things as a simple as his stature or that his face is too familiar. As a result, the love story on which obvious emphasis has been placed never quite gets off the ground. What we are left with then is pretty much the old Jackie Chan flick. Still, with the multi billion dollar (HK$) budget, an international cast and some pretty clever ideas (as the \"rat glue factory scene\" everybody mentioned), this movie IS entertaining. As well, although the \"historical\" portion is not exactly a resounding success, it does add another dimension to the movie. One final note � at half-century point, Jackie Chan finally yields a bit on his resistance to wire work and CGI. While we are all proud of his steadfast determination to do all the dangerous stunts himself, the laws of nature dictate that there are things that you just can't go on doing forever.",
         "This is a much better movie than previous jc movies made in Hollywood! There is more of a story and more drama. The scenery is excellent. It really brings out the beauty China and India has to offer. After reading several comments from reviewers i can not understand that they did not like this movie. Yes it's more serious, yes it is not typical JC action. But people forget JC is not up to his stunts because of his age. Still he kicks ass like the martial artist he is. I am a Jackie Chan fan since i could watch movies (5 years old)! And i have always liked his movies until he made real bad ones in Hollywood! Since his return in Hongkong you can see the improvement (maybe freedom he has making this movie)! The use of CGI was fitting for this kind of story.Honestly i really was moved by the story. People who love action you will get what you want,amazing stunts and the best martial arts! Also you romantic lovers will not be disappointed! I have only one point of criticism and that is the abrupt ending! But overall one of the better (Jackie Chan) movies made these last years.",
         "It's worth seeing the movie just even for the rat glue factory scene. It's a wonderful Jackie Chan physical comedy combined with a really nice striptease from the super hot Indian actress. Sure to become a classic scene. The rest of the movie constitutes of a historical \"Hero\" like war martial art action with some modern Jackie Chan slapstick. The plot is very tenuous and was probably written after someone wanted a story with Chinese history combined with a modern drive towards the nascent Chinese scientific and technological resurgence. Jackie Chan plays an Indiana Jones like archaeologist which spirals into a Lara Croft style adventure of finding very strange but mindbogglingly powerful things. Meanwhile a very hazy parallel story runs of a concubine who falls for a general played by Jackie Chan a few hundreds years in the past. There is anti-gravity devices and immortality pills thrown in as well. Though it does get really cheesy and maudlin at times, it's a really fun movie to watch.",
         "Saw the movie today. Nice authenticity with the arms, armor and tactics of the Qin Dynasty (comtemprary of Republican Rome)and attention to detail. And a very beautiful Korean princess who looked every inch the role. Overall entertaining movie with signature JC fight scenes in the modern parts of the story. This new Indiana Jones type role for JC is certainly refreshing. The cop role is getting stale. The ending is also new for a JC movie, and perhaps indicates a certain coming of age - no more everyone happy, bad guys in jail, good guys get rewarded template anymore. The use of multiple languages by native speakers corresponding to authentic locations is refreshing (Mandarin, Korean, Cantonese, English, Hindi)- no more stilted \"other\" languages.",
         "This is a wonderful movie with a mixture of many cultures in it. Just try and admire this movie and you will notice how they merge everything together. The language used in this movie is of course Cantonese as it is a movie from Hong Kong. Then there's Mandarin and Korean language and also at some parts they spoke Indian (I have no idea it's Hindi or Tamil language). They also communicated in English because they wanted to potray the modern world as English is known as the international language. The actors also come from a variety of races. Though the things that occurred in this movie might seem quite far-fetched, the title \"The Myth\" explains it all. Whether it's comedy, love, friendship, past, present, technology or wonders, this movie got it all! By the way, the soundtracks match very well with the movie, I just can't stop listening to the theme song \"Endless Love\" sung by Jackie and Kim.",
         "Well, it almost feels like two separate movies. I liked the half of the movie that takes place in modern times, that has some vintage Jackie Chan moment, like the fight in the glue factory or the tomb raiding fight in India, these scenes alone bring us back to a younger Jackie Chan era like Projetc A and Mr. Canton and Lady Rose. But the other half of the film, the epic historical stuff, is very, very cheesy, even the fights, which a loaded with CG for this half of the film, don't spark any positive reaction, and Jackie trying to play a serious, melodramatic role doesn't quite cut the mustard either. However, Tong uses brilliant cinematography for the old era China part of the film and I must compliment the film for some of its use of music. Overall, the story doesn't hold up as being remotely plosible. But thanks to some great comedy and other funny moments (that I don't think were meant to be funny) the film is still enjoyable. It's not Jackie's best, but it is better than most things he's put out in recent years, with the exception of New Police Story--which I think is his best in a long time.",
         "What do you expect when you see a movie like this? Something huge with thousands of extras and perfect computer effects? Check. Archaeology action like Indiana Jones? Check. Tragical love story with beautiful lady? Check. Speedy stunts, fights and fun like in the good old Jackie Chan flicks? Check. Judging by the sum of its parts, this ought to be the greatest movie of the 21st century. In reality, it's not quite so. 2 tremendously entertaining hours, yes, but not a perfect movie. What are the reasons? I'd like to name three. First, I always see Jackie Chan with a helmet, desperately trying to keep a straight face, when I am supposed to see the general. He just isn't that type of guy. The dreams or historical flashbacks are therefore less convincing than the scenes from the present day. Second, the whole anti-gravity stone thing has much too much Spielberg in it. The myth could have remained a myth, in other words: the audience doesn't always want a scientific explanation why things happen, especially if it's as unlikely as this one. Third, I think what neither worked well in this movie is the villain. From the moment he appears and does the usual \"I'll steal the big Blah to rule the world\" villain routine, the rest becomes predictable. If the screenplay had dared to move along a different path, it would have evoked less of the \"seen it before\" feeling. I enjoyed it, but regrettably it's not without the little flaws mentioned.",
         "It is reported that it was the first time Jackie Chan appeared in screen with ancient dresses (followed by Qin dynasty's customs), he is acting as a Qin's General Men-yi, as well as an contemporary archaeologist as sort of rebirth of that General, called Jack. I can hardly give the objective and impersonal comments since I am sort of fascinating with reincarnation topics, rebirth or Samsara things, and this film's plot was obviously inspired from them. This film ended up with all sorts of commercial shells reminded you following names, Indiana Jones, Tomb Rider , Jackie's typical comedic Kung Fu scenes, common love story and exoticism by appearance of that Indian Ms. busty yoga (Mallika Sherawat). Screenplay is not that good so the flaws and non-explained details are found everywhere, like how an ancient Chinese imperial concubine's painting is found in an Indian mummy tomb is left mystery. And in the scenario of outer space like catacomb, gravity can selectively exist when Jackie needs it to make fight available and disappeared when people needs to fly away. However, I reckon the scenario of General Meng-Yi's final fight is epic and heroic. Such heroical plot is not often seen in Jackie Chan's countless comedic martial art films, good change. And the Korean actress'(Hee-seon Kim) fairy-like appearance was impressive as well as her face looking. It is pity that in the end of film, Jack (Jackie)wrote an archaeological book called \"The Myth\", but in the preface of the book, it was only marked as dedicated to his male friend and colleague, but forgot that loyal and faithful Korean fairy princess, without regarding that she had been waiting for his return over 2000 years. For those western audiences, they perhaps need to comprehend some basic concepts in this movie are real historical facts, like Immortal drugs and emperor's catacomb, even the story is still fictional. Feature: In cinema, it was not often happened that the audiences didn't leave the cinema even the caption was already on, because Jacky always like to show a big No-Good screen shoot features and disclose the stunning a bit. There was an European girl left during the early caption.",
         "Credit to Jackie, he does try to do something different with his Hong Kong films. It would be easy for him to churn out countless sequels to already established series, but he does try to vary his output. Well, that is in as much as the constraints of his fans expectations and his established film persona will allow, anyway. The Myth, as a film, suffers paradoxically because of these two things; trying to satisfy by offering something new, while fulfilling audience expectation based on Jackie's previous output. The historical side of the film works best, providing Chan with a role (Army General bound by honour, compromised by love) that is unfamiliar and more interesting largely because of that. The action is more gritty and brutal in these sequences, with lots more blood on show than in typical Jackie fare. The present day character is classic Jackie, though the comedic set pieces and brief fight scenes don't have quite the inventiveness or sparkle of yesteryear. You can imagine the glue factory scene in particular being more involving and exciting if it had been choreographed twenty, or even ten, years ago. Stanley Tong's handling of the material is, due to the nature of his script, very uneven. The presentation of the modern day settings is fine, if a little uninspiring; especially when you consider some of the film's spectacular locations. However, the historical battles look and feel dull and lack any kind of epic quality. This may have been down to budget constraints, but watching the film you feel that if more clever camera-work had been employed, this effect could have been conveyed. Ultimately, it's a pity Jackie wasn't brave enough to do a straight, serious historical action/drama, because under The Myth's familiarity there's a different Jackie Chan film trying to get out."
