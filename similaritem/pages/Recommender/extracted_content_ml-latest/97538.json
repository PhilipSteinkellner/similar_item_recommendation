         "Anna gets thrown out of her house by her wicked stepmother, her fiancé gets tossed in jail for a murder he didn't commit, she gets pregnant, and her father has a heart attack. And that's just the beginning. Matarazzo puts the \"drama\" in \"melodrama\" and at first it's too ridiculous to handle. But then it gets so ridiculous that it's hilarious. And then it gets even more ridiculous and becomes kind of awesome. Some have compared Matarazzo to Sirk, but I see little of that subversive quality here, just pandering (his films were wildly popular in Italy, far more so than neorealism). But it's effective pandering, and you can't help getting invested it, despite -- or perhaps because of -- the absurdity of it all. Yvonne Sanson plays the martyr to the hilt, crying and fainting with all her heart. While I can't say this movie is \"good,\" it is entertaining. I'm cautiously looking forward to the next two in the set, which are supposed to be even more over-the-top.",
         "I had read that director Raffaello Matarazzo was known for melodramas, and this tearjerker certainly falls into that category. It's a morality tale on the dangers of losing your temper and making threats, not standing up to an abusive spouse, and having a child without preparing for unforeseen consequences. Amadeo Nazzari does OK as a loving man in serious need of negotiation skills. \"Anna, you look so rundown!\" he tells his beleaguered wife, Anna, in what surely must be one of the cheekiest comments in movie history. Greek-born Yvonne Sanson does all right as the woman who has married him, despite his facing a two-decade prison sentence, though she looks way too old to be bossed around by her stepmother. I found Tina Lattanzi somewhat one-note as the harridan who makes Anna's life miserable. But I enjoyed Teresa Franchini the maid for finally telling her off. This movie features several very nice Italian songs performed in a nightclub. Ultimately, though, it is a cinematic equivalent of potato chips -- OK to snack on, but not very substantial."
