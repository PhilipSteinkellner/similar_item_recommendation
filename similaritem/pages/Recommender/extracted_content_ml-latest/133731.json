Actually there's nothing new in this film, the same old storyline. There are hundreds of similar films, even you can compare to the recent 'If I Stay', but the thing is it was differently told tale. The director's first feature film, and actors are not the popular ones, but with a decent story, everything looks so fine. The graphics for this kind of budget, not really bad. They even had a decent CGI character. Actually, most of the film takes place in the dark time, so they had all the advantage, hence the production was very neat.\r\n\r\nKind of a limited cast film, but very occasionally a few characters, including small background crowd appeared. When the twist comes in the final act, you will realise it is the same old crap, but well maintained suspense in the initial parts. Those content balance and good development is what worked in favour of the film. So the overall film was very entertaining, because I was not expecting any big from it after learning how it was received. Not for everyone, but I also suggest don't believe in those negative remarks on this. It's definitely worth a watch, even if you are not going to rate it low. So I hope you make a good decision.\r\n\r\n_6.5/10_",

         "I feel like the ratings are giving this movie a bit of a beating, and unfairly so. I appreciate that this is not a mind-blowing blockbuster, but - taken in context - it is just a beautiful dark-tale. Someone previously mentioned 'pace' issues, but I didn't actually find it a fault. The two leads are strong and believable, even facing such a fantastical race to find a reason for what is happening. I think it is cleverly wrote to piece together the mystery. A few other reviews have mentioned 'Silent Hill', but if you are anything like me and a big wimp when it comes to horror... please don't be put off as although a bit nail-biting at times, it is far from 'Horror'. If you don't go in expecting it to change your life, then I would seriously recommend this film.",
         "When seeing the trailer for After for the first time, I was a bit skeptical. But the story peaked my interest. What I walked out of was a refreshing take on the genre of the thriller. I can't go into a \"scary\"movie anymore without watching either someone demon possessed (not really my thing) or girls and guys getting ripped to shreds by some mutant human. Sure, I love my Shining and even a little Evil Dead, but too much realistic gore just takes me out of the story. So, it was awesome to see a well acted, great looking film that had all the suspense I needed without the explicit gore. Lead Steven Strait did a wonderful job as our hero, while Karolina Wydra was captivating and easy to root for. What I loved most about this story was the idea of these moments that connect us that we may not even be aware of. How many people do you pass on the street that you may have played with as a kid, lived next door to, or more? Check out After. It offers plenty of thrills for the thrill seekers and yet also gives us a heart-warming story we unfortunately don't get to see in the Hollywood thriller anymore.",
         "I just watched the movie After on Netflix. I don't recall having heard anything about it previously, no reviews or anything of the sort. I was pleased with what I saw. It's difficult to discuss the movie without giving anything away and there are other movies with similar premises, but this one was well-executed. Two strangers from the same town meet one another on a bus, with a bit of abbreviated and failed flirtation, shortly before there is a severe accident. The next thing we know they are the only two people apparently alive and active in their town. There are no corpses and no signs of life beyond the two of them. Surrounding the town is a wall of black, swirling mist with lightning and thunder active within it...and the wall is closing in. It doesn't take altogether too long before the two protagonists discuss the possibility that they might both be dead, so they aren't as stupid as the characters in a lot of movies along these lines. We get to know them both pretty well along the way, through surprisingly natural conversation and glimpses into the past, without a lot of unnecessary exposition. I won't go into any further details, you'll need to watch it yourself if you want those, but the acting is good and the production quality is high enough that it doesn't feel like a low budget movie at all. It's always kind of nice to go into watching a movie without any idea what to expect and to be pleasantly surprised.",
         "Like one of the Twilight Zone episodes. It starts out as sci-fi, then seems to move to supernatural/horror, then revealed as a psychological thriller and love story. I thought acting was competent, dialog intelligent, well-made for such a tiny budget. You never quite know where this film is going, full of surprises and unexpected twists, even when you think you see where it is going. The empty small town may be remind you of \"Where is Everyone?\" (the first episode of Twilight Zone), but from there it takes off in its own direction, never staying in the same direction for long. There are hints that this is a dream, but not enough to spoil the plot.",
         "I freely admit, at first going in, I was more than a bit skeptical, but the key here is, you have to stick with it to really appreciate the concept, and the message. Kudos to a well crafted story, even if it was produced with a very minimal budget. Sometimes, a good film doesn't need huge production extravaganza effects and big name stars to convey a concept that will stick with you, make you remember and perhaps think just a bit. This is just such an example. I won't even attempt to explain the story as it unfolds, as that would risk possible unintentional spoilers, so nary a clue here. I'm not familiar with Jason Parish or Ryan Smith, but they deserve considerable credit for creating so much with so little, and really making it work. Karolina Wydra's performance was maybe a bit overly expressive, but then again, she is something of a cartoon character come to life as it were, so perhaps that caricature is the perfect match for her part here. OK, that's just a clue . . . Anyway, even if this is not your usual cup of tea, I'd say give it a watch, you're not likely to regret the time spent.",
         "This movie has a mediocre rating and I almost didn't bother watching it. I have a habit of watching a lot of movies and the downside is when looking for something to watch I'm usually thinking \"seen it\" or I start a movie and it's so boring I just won't finish it. Figuring this one was going to be really bad but having nothing better to watch I gave this movie a shot anyway and I'm glad I did. It's definitely got a low budget feel about it but don't let that or the rating put you off. The acting was decent and didn't try too hard, like a lot of low budget or B movies tend to do. The story-line was entertaining. The movie overall kept my attention and I didn't feel at any point that I was going to turn it off. This is in no way a \"must see\" or \"it blew my mind\" kind of movie but it was simple, doesn't try to be clever and just delivers a nice story that I enjoyed. Uncomplicated is how I would describe it. I would and will be recommending this movie to friends.",
         "\"After\" is a film written and directed by Ryan Smith and was released by the poorly named Quite Quick Productions back in 2012. Somehow it didn't get much attention and this is a sad omission, as there is a lot to like about this film. Fortunately, it is coming out on DVD very soon and I recommend you see it. The film is quite unusual because it has very few actors who speak in the film. Almost all the dialog (aside from a few flashback scenes) is spoken by just two folks\u2014Freddy (Steven Strait) and Ana (Karolina Wydra). The film begins with Freddy and Ana striking up an awkward conversation on a bus. Each is headed home from a trip and neither knows each other\u2014 though it turns out that they are neighbors. Soon, unexpectedly, the bus has an accident. When the pair awaken, they find that they are the only two people in their home town. Eventually, after wandering about, they find two EXCEPTIONALLY strange things\u2014a fog-like darkness is creeping closer and closer around the town and they occasionally see people who cannot see or hear them. These people, it turns out, are from their memories\u2014family and friends from long ago\u2014some of which are dead. This is pretty awful but things get worse. First, the pair hear a recorded conversation when they enter the hospital and it appears that these people they hear are planning on taking someone off life support\u2014 and that someone is Ana!! Second, it only gets worse because there is a monster in the darkness\u2014and soon it comes into the town looking for the pair! I could say a lot about this plot but really think you just need to see it for yourself. Why? The story is exceptionally taut and engaging\u2014and really appealed to me even though I don't normally like horror films. The writer/director really did a great job here\u2014and it really makes me want to see more work from Ryan Smith. Additionally, while Steven Strait and Karolina Wydra don't have a huge number of credits behind them, they are great in these leading roles. They are really believable and likable\u2014and I also would love to see more of their work in the future. Oddly, while I really loved \"After\", some story elements are similar to the god-awful film \"Soultaker\" (currently on IMDb's list of 100 worst rated films in history). I think it's pretty fair to assume that Ryan Smith didn't try to copy \"Soultaker\"\u2014after all, who would want to?! But there are some real similarities and it just goes to show you that great direction and acting can possibly take a seemingly bad idea and put it across. And, wow, did they do a good job putting After across! Well worth seeing and surprisingly strong where it counts\u2014at the ending.",
         "Very, very rarely I rate a 10. In this case I just had to because of the ridiculous 5,5 overall. And I don't even like romance movies! Normally I'm more \"all for action and excitement\" type of guy, but this title caught my eye via IMDb's \"you might like this\" object. So I took the risk and went out to catch a copy of the movie. Money well spent! Don't look at this movie as an action movie or complete fantasy fairytale. But look at this movie as the \"this could also be an option\" kind of film. You will know what I mean after you have seen it. So, even though I'm not the \"drama\", \"romantic\" or \"fairytale\" type and very much enjoyed this movie. Do not be fooled by some reviews that the acting was below average, because it was not!",
         "**Slight spoilers but nothing too specific** After is a well-shot indie fantasy film that's worth catching. The first 2/3 of the film setup, at a rather deliberate pace, some decent suspense and mystery as to what exactly is happening to our heroes. The last third turns from thriller more to romance, which personally turned me off. The film had good potential as a thriller in my opinion until they took that fork in the road. Pros: Two leads are solid in their roles, which is very respectable considering the weight that is put onto them. Interesting start and some decent mystery/suspense. Special effects were interesting. Cons: Stalled out in terms of thrills, took the film in an unexpected and, to me, unwelcome direction. Overall I think of After as a darker-in-nature \"What Dreams May Come\"-style fantasy but without the over reliance on special effects. The film is definitely worth seeking out for a viewing.",
         "I think most people will have more issues with the pacing than the story. Of course that doesn't mean that those same people will not be able to see where this is going (no pun intended). But if you can get yourself into the mood of the movie, you might actually enjoy it. It's slow building and the atmosphere it builds (nice framing/photography) is really good. Of course quite a lot is depending on the two main actors for obvious reasons. I think they're doing a pretty solid job. So while this is nothing to get over-excited about, it still can make for a nice little watch, if you like movies like that",
         "Where to begin? The plot is completely overdone and makes no real attempts to transcend its familiars. It's the mentally challenged little brother to LOST and all other \"are they dead?\" cliché's. In order to stand out it would need great characters and a story; instead 'After' continuously dredges the bottom of superior stories that use this trope such as \"the mysterious character connection,\" without bothering to make the audience actually hope for any connection between the two to begin with. You could lay out the plot points and see the potential, I won't spoil them for you, but it is a lack of execution and an absence of basic story-craft that kills \"After\" in the end.",
         "I just couldn't bond with this movie. In my opinion: the characters didn't seem authentic, they were facing a very traumatic situation but still found time to trade flirty wise ass banter. The genre seemed confused between horror / indie / thriller / teen-rom and the script was a festival of cliché. The production value was good - but that's not enough. What's the story with the girl being an All-American blonde haired kid turning into an adult brunette with - unless I'm mistaken - a European twang?",
         "Freddy and Ana are just two strangers on a bus when they are suddenly hurtled into a hazy, dreamlike world where it's a race against time to figure out where exactly they are and how to return to the world they once knew. It follows many familiar paths as far as the typical post-apocalyptic genre goes \u2014 it's hard not to be bored at times by the lack of originality \u2014 but it definitely puts more of a fantasy spin on the trope. I honestly think they drove the romance side of things a little hard. Freddy is interested in Ana pretty much immediately \u2014 he's so persistently flirty with her on the bus that I'm almost happy when it crashes. But I'm also someone who is generally annoyed by anything overtly romantic (or sexual) unless it is crucial or somehow beneficial to the plot, which in this case I really don't think it was \u2014 I think it just made it a whole lot more cheesy. Their acting definitely left something to be desired, and the script was just so boring that you really couldn't bring yourself to be invested in either of them. There are times when you could basically predict what the next lines would be before the actors would even speak. I did love the wall of blackness surrounding them \u2014 it reminded me a lot of \"The Nothing\" from The Neverending Story. Their efforts to figure out what exactly was happening and how much time they had to escape before they were swallowed whole definitely added some tension. Ultimately, while I didn't dislike the storyline \u2014 like I said, it was an interesting fantasy twist on the whole \"last people on earth\" idea \u2014 it just felt like too much was going on at once. I felt like it couldn't decide if it wanted to be post-apocalyptic, a monster movie, a psychological thriller, or if it wanted to try to be some kind of quirky indie romance, and while I don't think it's impossible to combine them all, this particular film just did so poorly. The romance aspect made it way too cutesy and sweet, which I think really distracted from the story and that time and effort could have been spent making it a bit more deep and complex. Not to mention I'm supposed to believe that Ana finds out that Freddy was, in fact, responsible for her aunt's death \u2014 something she has been drowning in guilt over for HER ENTIRE LIFE \u2014 and then she falls in love with the guy? STAHP.",
         "The initial tableaux: Nurse Ana and graphic novelist Freddy ride an almost deserted bus back to their common home town of Pearl. As it turns out, both live on Canon street. There's an accident, but both seem to wake up the next morning. The kicker is that there is no telephone service and no other people. Delineation of conflicts: The protagonists have to realize that they are dead. The two leads here are more stupid than most. Instead of being an 18 minute film, this dog lasts for 90 minutes. This is an old horror cliché dating back at least to the Twilight Zone, the early version in black and white. More recently, The Frozen (also 2012) did it again. Early in their explorations of Pearl and environs, they see a storm that surrounds the town on all sides. It moves in at 0.08 miles per hour, so they have about two or three days total. Attempts to penetrate the slow dark storm are rebuffed soundly. Resolution: Do they find an escape? Be sure to watch the final 3 minutes.",
         "Just finished watching this, and I immediately came here to find out how many people had been driven crazy by the absurdity of casting between the young Ana and Karolina Wydra's Ana. The young version of Ana is blond and speaks accent-free idiomatic English, while the dark Karolina has a clearly halting Slavic manner as the adult Ana. It is so dissonant as to make the movie rather strange to watch--definitely breaks concentration. I have to believe that poor Ryan Smith had the studio dump the casting on him, as no director with eyes & ears would ever seek out this level of dissonance.",
         "Really enjoyed this movie, it felt like a fresh twist on a few classic movie tropes. It reminded me of Silent Hill, with a mix of The Langoliers, but even with those in the back of my mind, I still didn't catch where it was going with it's story, and all was delivered at the right moments in the end. CGI effects were good, nothing super special, but delivered on the premises fine. It was really good stuff! If the director/writer ever reads this, good for you buddy!! You should be proud of your work, it was very well done and I wish you the best for the future!!",
         "AFTER is a dark thriller with some good ideas but also with some let downs at crucial parts. From the beginning we understand what this \"after\" of the main title means as the plot never hides they are in another dimension... The story becomes more interesting when they realize they are in a coma and they still have a chance to wake up, but then appears the let downs I did refer. It becomes too melodramatic, and the ending I might say is quite disappointing. The good things are especially this main idea of the plot: when they are in coma they conceive this \"world\" with their own memories and life experiences of the past and they have to fight against their own imagination! The tension created is good (but not great) and the CGI and the photography are very good for what seems to be a low budget\u0085 The actors work is not bad either. I score it 6/10.",
         "Two lonely people in the valley of the shadow of death struggle for freedom. Lots of praise for this - acting, pace, and it looks good. A two-hander, with the lead male particularly good, and dialogue excellent in parts. I liked the scene on the bus, and the analysis of the bedroom - \"You sleep alone, always on one side, pillow on the other side - keeping your hopes in\". Not enough humour, though. Story-wise it's difficult to criticise. A bit sci-fi, a bit allegory, bit psychological, symblogicaltastic. But definitely romance and not a horror, despite the CGI monster. I preferred to see it as a pragmatic pact between doomed depressives, but there was a load of back story suggesting fate brings lovers together, which was confirmed by the swelling strings in the slightly over-cheesed ending. Do individuals seek the one size that fits us all? I guess the answer divides optimists from pessimists. Overall this is Josh Wheedon style. I likesed it, but left feeling a bit confused.",
         "I've had this movie in my To watch list for a very long time and only lately that I decided to watch it.. The beginning is thrilling and excites you for what comes next. (spoilers ahead) The script went pretty well until Freddy and Ana got to the black fog wall, the events from there began to lose sense and had somewhat of a bad sequencing and a little bit confusing .. The acting was beautiful , both actors played their parts pretty well I just felt the script was a bore to some point . The ending was unexpected , when Ana woke up from the coma back in the hospital (where she was supposed to) but Freddy wasn't I have to say I was a little disappointed . I was entertained by this movie it was a great minimalist thriller , you should definitely watch it and you'll be surprised .",
         "I thought that After read well but I was cautiously optimistic because more times than not indie horror flicks don't usually end up impressing very well. I can honestly say that I wasn't disappointed with After. I enjoyed the film and thought it definitely gave off a creepy and intelligent concept. The unfortunate thing is that it feels like they didn't really know what direction they wanted to go in and while the film starts out promising it starts to fall apart and by the end you feel like they are truly grasping for straws. The story itself is exactly what I love about horror. Isolation, loneliness, mystery, the small town with everyone missing...its very King and Koontz and that is a very high compliment. However, both of those men know how to tie up a story and this one builds up these characters and what is happening to them and then leaves you disappointed. Even the \"major\" twist to the story is not impressive because you're already seeing the holes in the script by then. The production value for being an indie film is actually quite good and I was very impressed with the special effects. They are smart and use the monsters well without putting them in your face and the film never feels cheesy, not an easy feat for an indie horror. We have essentially two people in the entire film as stars. One is quite impressive and the other feels excruciatingly forced and awkward. Steven Strait gives a very solid performance. The script doesn't give him a ton to work with and he actually makes the supernatural experience believable and draws you into his character. I think a major flaw to this film is the casting of Karolina Wydra who just feels like she is bored and doesn't want to even try with this character. She actually has a lot of depth and background to play with but she just doesn't seem like her heart is in it. I have seen her in other things (most notably in TV's House) and I know she is a good actress so I think perhaps this was just a one off paycheck for her. The chemistry between them is so important and yet there is so little. Their best scene is early in the film when they are on the bus. I'm certain some would say that After is \"same old, same old\" because there are some familiar elements from similar genre films. That doesn't bother me in the least. The story itself has some unique flare and that works well enough. Ryan Smith is both co-writer and director and I hate sounding like a broken record but my rule of thumb is that 95% of writers should never direct their own material. Good writer doesn't mean good director but usually with indie films this is what happens. Smith doesn't do a bad job. As I said, the special effects border excellent for the budget, the style and use of darkness and close shots on the bus are all very well done. The script is the bigger problem and not because its bad but simply because it needs so much more editing and feels very rushed. However, people like me that love this corner of the horror genre won't be entirely disappointed. It wasn't a complete waste and I found it very watchable. I wouldn't necessarily watch it again but it was a solid effort. 6/10",
         "I am surprised at how well the good out weighs the bad of this movie. An obviously lower budget movie, but still well produced, and executed. In a nutshell this movie is a Silent Hill clone with a better payoff. As much as I like Silent Hill movies they always feel really empty in the emptiness, and you always know that what you are seeing is not real, where as in After you are never completely certain of who, how, or especially what these two souls will do next. I really did Enjoy the story told here, both sides, and some strong emotion is brought up for both sides. The encircling darkness as it closes in, and the extra layers that the childhood stories add to it is really solidly presented in my opinion. The keys at the door, and even the slobbering ever stalking monster are very nicely handled. Great acting from all of the characters, and the score was well developed to keep you in the right mood when you should be. So absolutely and as I mentioned surprisingly this movie gets a recommend from me, and not just to kill time, but for a slightly new take on the driving in circles from the monsters type story, and some really decent smoke effects in the middle of a well produced movie. Jesse of Jesse.ca",
         "I happy that B movies exist. Because mainstream filmmaker won't do this kind of simple experiment. Actually there's nothing new in this film, the same old storyline. There are hundreds of similar films, even you can compare to the recent 'If I Stay', but the thing is it was differently told tale. The director's first feature film, and actors are not the popular ones, but with a decent story, everything looks so fine. The graphics for this kind of budget, not really bad. They even had a decent CGI character. Actually, most of the film takes place in the dark time, so they had all the advantage, hence the production was very neat. Kind of a limited cast film, but very occasionally a few characters, including small background crowd appeared. When the twist comes in the final act, you will realise it is the same old crap, but well maintained suspense in the initial parts. Those content balance and good development is what worked in favour of the film. So the overall film was very entertaining, because I was not expecting any big from it after learning how it was received. Not for everyone, but I also suggest don't believe in those negative remarks on this. It's definitely worth a watch, even if you are not going to rate it low. So I hope you make a good decision. 6.5/10",
         "PROS: A good pro to acknowledge was how intense the movie was. You truly got scared. I don't think a person could watch this and not be at the edge of their seats. At the beginning of the movie there was something off, which really set the whole tone/mood for the rest of the film. As the movie continued and the mayhem kept enlarging you ended up getting completely engulfed in the entirety of the movie. You were scared when the director wanted you to be, you were sad when the director wanted you to be, and you were amazed when the director wanted you too be which is remarkable because it is so rare to have a director to have full control over your emotions\u0085 Just simply remarkable. CONS: Besides basic mishaps there were other large things that I felt actually hurt the movie. For starters the acting was meh. I don't feel that they really even were there. They could've been nonexistent and not even of hurt the storyline at all. This also says something about the storyline. Although I really respect creativity in horror movies, especially movies that make their own genre by themselves,but for me personally I din't really get what any of anything meant. Whats the door? Whats the fog? Whats the key? If anyone has any good answers please let me know! www.chorror.com",
         "Wow... What a nice surprise this film is. Watched it one evening and thought it was going to be just another minor league chiller. Instead, I found a thriller-chiller-mystery that is remarkably made on what may be a small budget... It doesn't look like a small budget, because everything is done with striking ability. One does know the genre at once, but one can enjoy the swirling 'who-what-where-how' for its entire length. The two actors show enormous potential and do absolutely super work. I want to see more of them...and more of the director of this indie. When you mix 'Outward Bound' with a contemporary appearance and then zap the audience with nicely executed twist, you have a fine piece of cinema. Congrats to all.",
         "I have watched this movie several times and love it. Why? It begins with Freddy and Ana (20 somethings) traveling on a bus late at night traveling back to their homes. They attempt small talk and Freddy, a comic book illustrator draws a sketch of Ana (nurse returning from vacation). Then, the bus crashes. They wake up in a dark, smoky adaptation of their hometown. No one is around, it seems to be night, and both are very bewildered. The viewers are allowed a peek at their childhoods (which are in color and have people within the scenes). These peeks give much information for the viewer. Once when they were about 10 years old, they brushed shoulders at a local carnival. It is through these scenarios that the viewers are aware that the story they are living in this smoky, abandoned world is partly from Freddy's drawings and Ana's story that she had written as a child. They are going about this town looking for people, trying to figure out where this place is while trying to escape. (Note: Freddy, as a child, drew a comic entitled, The Veil, an obvious but well-hidden hint to their situation.) All the while, this town is being engulfed by a very immense 'smoke storm'. As it comes in contact with parts of the town, the town disappears. Because of this, both Freddy and Ana must find a way back to their 'real' life. They realize they are counting down the hours. Part of the story involves a simple, childish play written by a 10-year old Ana. It is about a knight/prince waging war with this many sharp-toothed, drooling monster. As a result, when acting this play, tragedy strikes. This shows the true relationship of Freddy to Ana. Finally,they do battle the monster and discover how their lives are so involved by fate. They discover how their attitudes and beliefs were shaped by certain misconceptions. Without giving the ending away, I can say that much of the film is symbolic of many things which have happened to both characters. It shows that reality is often not reality - just one's perspective. And, it makes you think about what they really were going through while in this dark town."
