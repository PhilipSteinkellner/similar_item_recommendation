         "In the concept of Hill&Spencer films, \"Y si no, nos enfadamos\" (Spanish title) is one of the funniest. Plot is designed specially for this actors, and they use all the tricks for they are best known. Unforgettable, the scene of the chorus (a.k.a. \"pom pom pom / la la la)and the last battle in the balloons room. One interesting detail about this film is that it was filmed in Spain (more exactly in Madrid) and you can see many spanish support artist like Luis Barbero (well known in last years due to his character \"Matías\" in \"Médico de Familia\") or humorist Emilio Laguna (chorus director.) So you must watch this film... o si no, nos enfadamos ;)",
         "If you want to see a very funny and addictive action movie, you must watch this one... Here we have two rival wreck car racing pilots(Bud Spencer and Terence Hill), both very skilled, so skilled that after a tremendous race they finishes simultaneously... and together they wins a dune buggy, the prize for the winner. Naturally, each of them wants the buggy for himself, so the tough guys decides to bet the car in a \"beer and beans\" contest(!). But just when the \"contest\" starts, the bad ones, led by a megalomaniac rich man and his psychologist, destroy the dune buggy...... You can imagine the reaction of Spencer and Hill... A remarkable scene: the one of the killer (\"Paganini\") in the auditorium.(A masterpiece!)",
         "Way way back in 1978, this film ran on our cable about two weeks before we got our first VCR. I've been looking for a copy ever since. It may be the single best of the Hill/Spencer collaborations; wonderfully silly and harmlessly violent. Hill/Spencer films have always reminded me of the better Warner Bros. cartoon shorts -- as if the Wolf and the Sheep Dog interrupted their long-running battle of wits and teamed up to save the peaceful sheepherders from the evil cattlemen. If you like slapstick humour that falls somewhere between Hope & Crosby, Laurel & Hardy and the Three Stooges, but more physical than any of those, this is a film you should see.",
         "This movie is hysterically funny! It is by far the best of the Terence Hill/Bud Spencer oeuvre. For my money it even tops the Trinity movies! What is not to like about this movie? The pained, laconic expression on Spencer's face is a sure-fire laugh-getter every time! What about the terrific fight choreography? The fight in the gym was already good enough to put this film in the Slapstick Hall of Fame... but then they come up with the great finale with all the balloons! And the hot dog eating contests! And Oliver Onions singing \"Dune Buggy\"! And the incredible choir scene! With deep baritone Spencer inching his way over to the ladies' section and trying (unsuccessfully) to hit their high notes! This movie is pure genius! There *are* many lame Spencer/Hill comedies out there... but this is definitely not one of them!",
         "This is a great film. A friend lent it to me, and I thought I probably wouldn't like it, but it turns out that I love it! It has everything: Side splitting scenes, like when they are singing in the choir (\"Bwa-bwa-bwa!\"), cheesy bad guys, retro fashion, a stylish bad guy, in the form of Paganini, and true friendship. I thought the fight scenes were amazingly well choreographed. 10 out of 10!",
         "This is, IMHO, the best film of Bud Spencer and Terence Hill, almost matched by \"Non c'è due senza quattro\". A small accident causing an incredible series of events, a dummy bad boss surrounded by a gang of dummy bad bullies, a lot of fake violence, and an irresistible crescendo of gags up to the grand final at the bosses party... A movie belonging to Bud & Terence golden age, far before the two began to quarrel and broke the pair. The scene at the firefighters' chorus in unforgettable 8-)",
         "I LOVE THIS FILM! IF THERE WAS ONE MOVIE I COULD KEEP OUT OF MY 200, I'D KEEP THIS ONE! The Plot : Kid and Ben are contestants in a race car derby so they can win the grand prize, on red dune buggy with a yellow top. They both cross the finish line at the same time. They dont know who is going to keep the Dune Buggy so they have the legandary Hotdog eating and Beer drinking contest in an Amusement Park. In the middle of the contest the mafia destroys the amusement park and they also wreck Kid and Bens Brand New Dune Buggy. They arent happy with this, so they try many ways to get a new dune buggy from the mob. They mob isnt happy so they hire a hit man name Paganini to kill both Kid and Ben! I'll stop here....I don't want to tell the end of the movie! Just go rent it....that will be hard for Americans because this movie isnt released there. The best scenes are Kid and Ben singing in the Choir, the jousting on motor cycles, and the fight in the gym and the fight at the Restaurant! Its too bad that many people dont like the fight humor in T+B films! I'd perfer these anyday to Hollywood type movies! People who dont understand these movies should lighten up and realise how funny they are! If you liked this movie i suggest these: 1. They call me trinity 2. trinity is still my name! 3. crime busters 4. odds and evens 5. Flatfoot (aka- Piedone lo Sbirro) W.O.W.M. gets a 9/10 !!!!!!!!",
         "Closed action, humour to the maximum. A trick away the other, he works everything perfectly, there is nothing out of place ! Bud Spencer to the maximum of the form. Memorable sequences, from that of the game of the Lippa to the duel on bikes. Donald Pleasance funny in the part of the psychiatrist. But the top is the scene of the chorus: irresistible music and the couple engaged to escape from the killer. Phenomenal. The all one seasonned by an exceptional sound-track, compound from Guido and Maurizio De Angelis (Oliver Onions). Overall the mythical song \"Dune Buggy\" whose words have been written by director Marcello Fondato.",
         "Terence Hill and Bud Spencer star in this exciting comedy,in which the mob destroys their newly won car.And then...they get mad.So there's the plot.The script isn't especially good,it's rather simple,but the inherent innocence provides more laughs than,say,\"American Pie\".You will be swept into this... \"universe\" the moment you'll hear the title song.This film strangely works.Somehow,you won't care about the plot holes or about the non-existing script.Bud Spencer and Terence Hill are very convincing and that's because they aren't acting.They appear in the film as themselves!The only thing that changes for these two friends are their names(Ben and Kid).Ben hates Kid,because he always manages to get him into trouble.Kid doesn't hate Ben,he just likes to tease him,that's all.In fact,these men are part of each other.They resemble the dual personality that everyone has.Terence,the handsome,cool-tempered,angel-like man,is actually the exact opposite of Bud,the fat,ill-tempered devil.Looks can be deceiving though.Terence is the one who gets the peaceful Bud in this mess.Bud is seen as the gentle giant in his film,the naive powerhouse,while Terence resembles the seductive,intelligent little nuisance.The fight scenes are spectacular,the humor fails only with the American audiences(who inexplicably loved \"They call me Trinity\")and there are many things going on(love story,chases,rallies)to keep you interested.In Italy,this is their favorite Bud&Terence movie!",
         "Likable Terence Hill and stocky Bud Spencer team up again in this co-production Spaniard-Italian as the valiant and sympathetic duo Kid and Ben against totally evil bad guys. Two charming friends (Terence Hill and Bud Spencer) but rivals participate in a race whose prize is a fancy mini-car . They tie in a car crash race to win a red dune buggy . During Kid and Ben's hotdog and beer contest , to see who will keep the the dune buggy, various hoodlums of a local mobster named the Boss (John Sharp) demolishes and destroys the bar and their car . After that , the duo goes to visit the Boss and his helper (Donald Pleasence) . Kid and Ben want vendetta and the replacement of their red buggy with a yellow top . Meanwhile , Terence Hill falls in love with a circus artist (Patty Shepard) and they are chased by a cold killer (Manuel De Blas) hired by the mobs . Of course, along the way they will combat thieves ,thugs and criminals . The 'big time' duo of Spaghetti Western with humor such as ¨They call me Trinity¨, ¨ Trinity is still my name ¨ and sequels as ¨Troublemakers¨ were run out and for that reason are transfered in modern era film , playing the police/action genre and adventures as ¨All the way boys¨ also titled ¨Plane crazy¨ and this one . After that , they starred the successful ¨ Miami police series ¨, which belong the following : ¨Crime Busters¨ , ¨Superfuzz¨ and ¨supercops in Miami¨. The movie contains silly comedy , the usual slight fights and lots of action including some motorcycle pursuits with a funny tournament , entertaining struggles in a gymnasium and a fun ball in a saloon . Although there are a few gaps ,especially the overuse of fist fights with punches , bounds and leaps and a quarter-hearted attempt at romance, it remains very amusing .The humor is based on physical and personality differences of the starring , as Terence Hill is the sympathetic and brave hero and Bud Spencer is the corpulent and hunk man. As always several humorous struggles with no blood , neither violence . Enjoyable performance by Donald Pleasence , a veteran British actor with a long and prestigious career ; furthermore , being a co-production Spanish-Italian appears several Spanish actors as Luis Barbero as the old garage owner , Emilia Laguna as the musical conductor and Manuel De Blas as the silent murderer . Acceptable cinematography by Zavattini filmed in Madrid , Spain .Commercial musical score by the usual Guido and Maurizio De Angelis -Oliver Onions- , including catching songs fitting perfectly in the mood of the movie and you won't be able to get the catchy theme leitmotif out of your head. The motion picture is professionally directed by Marcello Fondato, following the Hill-Spencer ordinary trademarks . Fondato wrote several Spencer vehicles as ¨Bulldozer¨, ¨Aladino¨, ¨The Supersheriff¨, and ¨The sheriff and the extraterrestrial little boy¨ and directed him in ¨Mister Charleston¨. If you love the pair's other movies, go for it, and if you've never seen one this is a great start ."
