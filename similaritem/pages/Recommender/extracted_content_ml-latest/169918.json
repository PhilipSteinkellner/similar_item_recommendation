Retrospect doesn't really help this special, but it is still a funny and well -constructed mix of observational identity humor, and political barbs. There is a certain broadness to it perhaps, but mostly the show is tightly delivered and Stewart holds the audience well. The content has dated somewhat, so I did not understand all the references (I was still in Northern Ireland twenty some twenty some years ago, so US politics of the day was not really a focal point for me), but the laughs were still there aside from the odd joke that didn't work for me. The show perhaps lacks the polish, sharpness, and experience of his most famous work on TDS, but there is a lot here that stands up, and shows the time and work put into his political comedy over many decades."],
