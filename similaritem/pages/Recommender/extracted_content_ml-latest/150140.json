         "I haven't seen such a rich way of storytelling and humor deliverance until i saw this short film, it has it's unique ways of telling the personality of the guy behind the computer, and the actions shown on screen (whether it is a chatting room, internet statuses, web-cams, among others) have a very convincing way of delivering it's character development and a smart story puzzle that can be set up by it's own audience, this, with sprinkles of black humour presented in clever visual comedy with such honesty about human behavior, the way people connect and share experiences through modern technology, and when it does end, it is sort of heart-breaking also, but the way it settles it's honesty and doesn't fall into typical teenage movie trappings is also one of the little things that \"Noah\" does well enough to deserve recognition and take note of the clever visual metaphors applied to perform it's simple yet creatively honest and darkly hilarious plot on the best and most relatable way possible. \"Noah\" is a must see. And, not talking about the Darren Aronofsky's one.",
         "\"Noah\" is a 2013 18-minute short film from Canada and the people who made this are Patrick Cederberg and Walter Woodman and they received a decent amount of awards attention for it. Very much deserved, I must say. I myself am not on Facebook, but otherwise very active on the internet and that's why a whole lot in this movie rang very true for me. After watching this, I ask myself is the technological progress we have really an advantage or was it better back then decades or maybe even centuries ago. We basically watch the internet activity by a guy named Noah, how he Skypes with his girlfriend and watches porn in the meantime and chats with other girls and when his girlfriend asks what's up he says he has been checking out Lolcat spam. While confessing his love to her, right before he finds out she has been chatting nicely with another guy, not explicitly though. His reaction: He hacks her Facebook account and changes her relationship status to \"Single\". More stuff follows about Omegle, little internet games, music and a whole lot more that is closely connected to the online world nowadays. It seems as if he learned from the Omegle conversation with a random strange near the end and turns everything off. Maybe that is sometimes not the worst choice. And it also is an uplifting ending I believe. Noah has been a victim of social media and the one he hurt the most through his actions was certainly himself, but it seems he may have found a way out and learned something from the conversation with the girl. I also thought that this conversation was the best moment of the film. He is desperate for contact. She says that she does not care about social media. of course you could criticize her for being on Omegle, but still, lets not be too serious here. Also the one question he could ask her that she would respond to truthfully was a major deal-breaker. He asked for Facebook, the one thing that has such a negative impact on him and this question robs him off the opportunity to ever see her again or talk to her again after he initially succeeded to impress her with his real life ability of playing the guitar. We all can learn a whole lot from this little movie. I highly recommend the watch and I applaud the makers. Very enjoyable, entertaining and also very true."
