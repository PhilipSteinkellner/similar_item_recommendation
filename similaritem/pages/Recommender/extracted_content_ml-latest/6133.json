      "synopsis": "A film crew is stranded in a melancholy seaside hotel somewhere outside of Lisbon when the production runs out of money mid-shoot. The director, Friedrich, is a gentle philosophical leader of intellect and heart who enjoys a paternal relationship with everyone in the cast and crew. He is a rock of calm in the midst of this crisis, keeping his charges fed and sheltered not only physically, but emotionally. He accomplishes this through maintaining the company's focus on their art and humanity during the boring days they spend waiting for an infusion of cash to resume work. His steadfast ally in this is the grizzled old cameraman Joe, whose vast experience in the business steadies him as a father can a son. As days stretch out with no word from their producer back in the USA, the people occupy themselves in the minutiae of forestalling the crushing boredom. They are becoming a family of sorts, forced to empathize and interact with each other more intimately than film crews normally do. It is the silver lining in this cloud of doubt enveloping them. But as days become weeks, foreboding begins to overtake them. Joe must return home to bury his terminally-ill wife, reluctantly leaving Friedrich to manage the worsening situation alone. Dennis, the high-strung line producer/writer, begins to snap, despairing in what he calls the \"suicide\" of making films. When Friedrich attempts to assuage Dennis' panic, pleading, \"We're in the same boat\", he replies, \"No, YOU'RE in the boat --- I'm on the ship.\" Dennis, like many paranoids, is privy to knowledge others miss. He knows many important facts that he's withholding from Friedrich: like the elaborate data base he's assembled which tabulates and illustrates every aspect of their project from storyboards and budget to biographies of all players ... and most important, the fact that their producer has deserted them and there will be no more money. Friedrich can sense the unspoken betrayal though he cannot believe it. He realizes with alarm that drastic measures are necessary. He desperately flies to Hollywood to talk to his producer and old friend Gordon if only to obtain a reason for his abandonment. Now the interminably sluggish pace of Portugal is accelerated to the frenetic pace of L.A. He soon discovers after a convoluted search that Gordon isn't just hiding from him, but everybody. And there is something very spooky going on: he's being shadowed as he tries to find Gordon. He eventually locates Gordon hunkered down in a borrowed mobile home parked beside LA's last drive-in burger joint on a seedy part of the Sunset Strip. They greet each other warmly and immediately renew their familiar camaraderie. In the RV, Gordon finally reveals to his friend what has happened. He loved the dailies he saw coming from Portugal. He proudly showed the rushes to the investors, who didn't understand what was wrong with the picture, wanting to know what had happened to the color. When Gordon explained to them that it was shot in black-and-white, they were very disappointed. Unfortunately, these investors' displeasure is keener than normal: they're the Mob. They put out a contract on Gordon. As their night of sad/comic ruminations on the nature of art, stories, Hollywood and reality turns to dawn, the friends step outside the RV for a last hug as Gordon prepares to go back underground and Friedrich back to Portugal to somehow reconcile his crew to the state of things. Then the hit goes down, efficiently, anonymously and finally.",

      "reviews": [
         "From the first time I saw it, this film resonated strongly on two levels; first, it is an excellent example of Wenders at his best: an almost dreamy progression of exactingly composed images, mysterious characters, a \"story\" which comes as close as film can to \"truth\", and for the cineastes in the audience, a complex dialogue with films of the past. But my second reason for loving this film is far more personal. As a teenager growing up in Hollywood during the early 1980s, I knew nothing about Wim Wenders or film history, but friends guided me to this film because of the soundtrack and the images at the end, inside an RV wandering aimlessly in Hollywood. This is, as far as I know, the first film to use either X or Joe Ely in the soundtrack. It also captures a lost city with amazing precision; almost every shot at the end contains some nostalgic element, from Tiny Naylor's drive-in to the Parisian Room, from Schwab's Pharmacy to the white smog in Laurel Canyon. This is a great film, but for Los Angelenos of my generation, it's a treasure-trove.",
         "Between commercial successes like Paris Texas and Angels over Berlin, Wenders still manages to make the kind of seemingly irrelevant road movies such as Santiago and State of Things, that have made him the cult hero he is. Here a cheesy scifi B-movie is interrupted at a climatic scene to follow people just hanging around talking. Which is more cinematic is a question that comes back over and over again. Actively pursuing a life, no matter how mundane or screwed up, seems to be more rewarding than passively waiting to have someone else fulfill your fantasies, or so this film seems to hint. Good film for those still in love with non virtual reality.",
         "The thing about a film like \"The State of Things\", much like Wenders' earlier film \"The Wrong Movement\", is how too much introspection can really start to drag one down over time. Both pictures have the unfortunate distinction of talking themselves to death. This is not a film that gives you insight into life so much as insight into its specific characters. The value of this tends to decrease in the face of the fact that we never really get to know the characters in the first place. So this story seems to play like an ever-extending observation into enigmas, where each answer is really a question, like the cinematic equivalent of the \"Jeopardy!\" game show. There are moments of true beauty, there's no denying that. But the beauty comes in the cinematography, the silences - not in the dialogue. The multiple cinematographers create a nice feel together, a fantastic series of images. \"The State of Things\" is almost always worth looking at, just not always engaging to fully experience. The ending is somewhat of a curiosity. Neither particularly disastrous nor completely convincing. It feels more like an artistic statement. And not one of great depth or meaning, either.",
         "This is not a movie that's easy to understand, yet it easily makes you think. It smells of nostalgia and of things past and fading. The film that the film crew is shooting about survivors to a nuclear holocaust is a parallel to the director's own journey to collect money from his LA producer in order to continue the film. The movie is visually beautiful, full of the magic of black and white photography. It's also a movie that constantly speaks about itself, about the hardships of shooting black and white, and about the need for \"a story\" which the film itself seems to lack. It tries not to be a film, but to film life. Yet, in the ordinary and particular of everyday life it conveys the eternal and universal.",
         "This film was shot by Wenders while he was waiting for Coppola to get the financing to complete Hammett and his frustrations with that experience are clearly expressed here. It is a very personal film and, as such, I think one of his best. The end sequence in LA is classic. Shot in beautiful black and white, this is really a must see for any fan of the 'art film' in general and of Wenders' work in particular.",
         "This is one movie I've enjoyed seeing over and over.It's one of my all time favorite. The story is pretty simple; A filmmaker runs out of money while shooting in Portugal. He goes looking for his producer in Los Angeles to find out what is going on. This one of the most beautifully shot movie in black and white I've seen and it helps to set the overall atmosphere of the film. The cast is great and the story flows right along. Apart from a few lenghty scenes (wich is why I gave it a 9), you won't be disappointed.If you're interested at all about movie making don't miss this one.",
         "Not only is this film a classic - the short ends became Stranger Than Paradise making this film a true two-fer. A very anti-Hollywood film structured first as a kind of meditation and then turning into a great faux whodunit indictment of Hollywood itself. This won't make a lot of sense until you actually see the film - but see it you must if you are a true film afficianado. Ignore the ridiculous film geek influenced 7.3 rating - the actual rating of 7.7 is much more accurate. One of the films that made Wim Wenders great.",
         "This movie is probably one of the best movies of the early 80's. A simple story: the beginning is enigmatically, the dessert?, the space? a lonely and a dead world and people who are trying to survive in a terrible weather, but they are just making a movie in Portugal, then the concepts of money and economics and \"the life goes on\" appears. Wenders makes a journey into reality, and this is cruel. The journey from fiction to reality is long and atmospheric. It ends in LA with an assassination. The interior monologues of the actors and the static of each scene is definitively material to be study by every cinematographic student.",
         "Time has passed since i watched this wonderful movie, and it remains in my mind like those dreams you remember for ever although had lasted ten, twenty, thirty years, like a child's dream. In effect ever i though this film was made as Wenders wanted to built an feverish dream, the American night, in a gorgeous black and white, the scene the crew is filming with that children dying and screaming like an hurt animal, and the self image that Friederich receive in an old printer from the screenwriter. Do you remember those old movies of 60's made in the Nuevo Mexico desert? Those movies made in a high percentage in a false night that you could feel the heath of a warm wind?. Longer, the best Wenders'film.",
