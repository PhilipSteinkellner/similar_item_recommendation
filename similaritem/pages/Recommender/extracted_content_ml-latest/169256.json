         "I really liked this quiet yet powerful indie, which I thought was extremely well acted, written, and directed. Riley Keough and Jena Malone give superb performances in their lead roles here. Keough portrays Sarah who's in an unhappy marriage with a workaholic husband, while devoting herself to her young daughter Jessie. Malone plays Mindy who is Sarah's best friend but which eventually develops into a sexual relationship between the two. The chemistry between Sarah and Mindy works exceedingly well throughout the movie, despite the fact that they are conflicted about committing to each other, and thus continue in their daily lives without doing so. Even years later, when Mindy is set to be married the powerful erotic and spiritual connection between the two continues. Overall, this is one of those films that caught me by surprise and if you like quiet indies that really grab you and are filled with realism, then this one may very well be to your liking. To note, there are several raw and explicit conversational scenes for those that are concerned about this in a movie. Korean-American filmmaker So Yong Kim ably handles the direction here, and co-wrote the script with her husband Bradley Rust Gray.",
         "'LOVESONG': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A drama about two best friends that take an unplanned road trip together, along with one of the woman's toddler daughter. They then become romantically involved together, until one of them suddenly leaves. They then meet again, three years later, at the disappearing woman's wedding. It stars Jena Malone, Riley Keough, Brooklyn Decker, Amy Seimetz, and Jessie OK and Sky OK Gray. It was directed by So- yong Kim, and written by Kim and Bradley Rust Gray. The film had it's world premiere at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival, and it's gotten mostly positive reviews from critics. I found it to be a very beautiful, and exceptionally well made, love story. Sarah (Keough) is an unhappily married mother of a three-year-old daughter named Jessie (Jessie OK Gray). As she feels like she's starting to have a mental breakdown, Sarah decides to call her best friend Mindy (Malone). Sarah, Mindy and Jessie then go on a road trip together. As Sarah and Mindy talk more and more, they become closer and closer (in a very intimate way). Then Sarah's husband calls. As the reality of the situation starts to set in, Mindy decides to suddenly leave. This leaves Sarah heartbroken. The two best friends meet again though, three years later at Mindy's wedding. The movie is beautifully shot and acted. The characters definitely seem like real people, and as a viewer you feel like you can really relate to their love and pain. I think the film is an outstanding indie love story. It's pretty subtle and short, and it might leave some viewers wanting more, but I think it's a nearly perfect film. It's a great examination of relationships, and how people react to them. Malone and Keough both give great performances in it, and I think So-yong Kim makes a very good impression as a talented filmmaker to watch out for.

         "Definitely didn't know to expect for this film, but what it eventually ended up being is a solidly written and very well acted tale of two friends. It's not a film driven by plot at all, and for that reason it may not engage all types of viewers, but it does tell a nice human story. More than anything, the two leads are really quite good in this. It's nice to see Riley Keough leading a film like this and I hope she continues to get offered roles, and Jena Malone can always be relied on something extra in her roles. This was no exception.",
         "It's not an exciting movie. It moves very slowly but it's only about an hour and 20 minutes long. There's no big payoff. But the writing, directing and acting are superb. It feels like you're watching a documentary. I wonder if most of the dialogue was ad libbed because it feels so natural. Riley Keough (as she did in \"The Girlfriend Experience\") has an incredible ability to convey all of her character's feelings without saying a word. There are many scenes when the camera focuses on her eyes, body language, wrinkle of her mouth, tone of her voice, body movements and expressions which move the scene along better than any dialogue could ever do. Jena Malone is also very good but despite her top billing, this is clearly Keough's movie. The movie will disappoint those who want action or suspense or a tidy ending. But for people who appreciate superb acting, writing and directing, the film is rewarding and Riley Keough is amazing.",
         "Lovesong (2016) was co-written and directed by the Korean-American filmmaker So Yong Kim. It stars Riley Keough as Sarah, a young married woman who might as well be a single mom. (Her husband is away for months on business.) Sarah lives in a beautiful home, in a beautiful setting. She has a great daughter, Jessie, played at age three by Jessie OK Gray, and at age six by Sky OK Gray. (I assume they are the director's two daughters.) Enter Sarah's old friend Mindy (Jena Malone) who lives in New York City. They haven't seen each other for years, but they're still good friends. We get a sense that they're more than good friends, but director Kim is discrete about these things. After spending the night together, Mindy leaves for NYC. The women don't meet up again until three years later. There was a good movie in here somewhere, but it never made its way out. Both women are moody, taciturn, and passive. As an example, it apparently never occurs to Sarah that she could do more with her life than be a mother to Jessie, and wait for her husband to return home. How about leaving Jessie with a sitter and volunteering for a political cause or for a library? Nope. She just sits home, takes walks, and sulks. Mindy doesn't appear to have any thoughts at all. She makes an offhand comment about work, but she never says what she does and how she does it. She certainly has a gamine-like charm, but we don't see anything else to recommend her as a friend or as a person. This is the movie to see if you want a story about two attractive women who don't really connect with each other or with the world. Otherwise, find a better movie and watch that one. We saw this film at the excellent Little Theatre, as part of the wonderful ImageOut Rochester LGBT Film Festival. It will work well on the small screen. Lovesong is one of 22 films that had their New York State premiere, or their East Coast premiere, at ImageOut. My compliments to the ImageOut Programming Committee for their great success in bringing these films to Rochester.",
         "Lovesong is an intimate relationship drama, lovingly told, the kind of indie that hangs not on the script or dialogue, but on the beauty of the images and the mostly silent performances of its leads. And while the story is intriguing and the actors good, it never really rises up to become something memorable. Lovesong is, true to its title, a bittersweet love story about two best friends, Sarah and Mindy. Sarah married young and now finds herself isolated as a single mother who only has a toddler to talk to, her husband travelling around the world. She calls her friend Mindy who immediately, like a breath of fresh air, arrives to reassure her, tell her that she's a good mom and to urge her to have fun. The two friends along with Sarah's daughter go an impromptu road trip. But while discussing their past some tension comes up and the two end up pushing their relationship into a more romantic capacity. Things go a bit awry and the movie picks up three years later just as Sarah's relationship is dissolving and Mindy is about to get married. Writer/director So Yong Kim keeps things simple and naturalistic for her leading ladies (no makeup and a distinct lack of over the top reactions). The two main actresses Jena Malone and Riley Keough both work with her very well. But while the two have a soft chemistry that suits the style of the movie it isn't the kind of burning passion that would have made this film really stand out. And everything feels too subtle, too subdued. I liked this movie well enough while I was watching, but I also have the distinct feeling that it won't exactly stick in my mind. Still worth watching.",
         "As we celebrate the official 10th Anniversary of the mumblecore genre, it's exciting to see the only female filmmaker (to be included in the cinematic hipster scene) presenting a new film that equals or even surpasses her landmark debut IN BETWEEN DAYS (2006). This time, actress Riley Keough, who also stars in the Amy Seimetz's new Starz TV adaptation of THE GiRLFRiEND EXPERiENCE (which also premiered at Sundance this year), takes the emotional reigns with gusto as Sarah, a young mother who is completely caught off guard by the sudden reappearance of her college friend Mindy (Jena Malone). Much like So's overlooked FOR ELLEN (2010), which Paul Dano subtly referenced in Paolo Sorrentino's YOUTH (2015), the power in LOVESONG (named after The Cure's song) lies within the character's inability to express his true feelings. Independent Spirit Awards could be on the horizon for this bundle of true love, but more importantly, make sure you see this on the big screen so that you too can be transported into the whirling clouds during what has to be the most breathtaking sequence on a ferris wheel since Carol Reed's The THiRD MAN (1948). This is taken from my 2016 Sundance Film Festival wrap up.",
         "I haven't seen any of So Young Kim's other movies, but I am going to make an effort. I understand the varied responses of others here, and make no excuses; it is different for me, and this love story really is a Lovesong, one played in the background over several years, which rises from piano to sforzando, and back to quietness. Remarkably acted and directed, Riley Keough and Jena Malone are just perfect in the depiction of their barely suppressed love for one another. The film both delighted and depressed me, but it has become one that I will buy to keep. I do agree with a review of Lovesong by Justin Chang in \"Variety\" on 25 Jan 2016: \"There's a remarkable truthfulness to the film's acknowledgment that people often make enormous decisions rooted not in fear so much as uncertainty, even laziness, as well as a comfort with their lives as they've lived them until the present juncture.\" What is left unsaid is the consequences of those decisions, that we are left to look out the window and consider. Well done.",
         "Too many scenes use to show the emotional attachment between the two main characters, when all they really seem to do is make the movie longer so it can become a full length feature. Two good friends separated by life reconnect very intensely over a weekend and then three years later see there lives have change when one of them is getting married. I can relate to the second part of that synopsis, when Sarah reconnects with Mindy on her wedding day, after they have not seen each other in three years, you have to understand that no matter how close you two were you are no longer the center of Mindy's life, especially on her wedding day, and now Sarah has to connect with people in Mindy's life who seem closer and you do not know at all. I did enjoy this part. I also like the relationship between Sarah and her daughter Jessica. The interaction between Sarah and the child actresses who played Jessica at 3 and 6 was so real. An amazing combo of timing and acting that's hard to get with little children, it does not feel fake at all so that was real cool to see. But overall, I though the film could have done a better job expressing the plot points. Like I said earlier, I see a long short film being strength out to make a feature length film and it makes the movie dull to watching the two characters look deep into each others eyes for longer than two minutes more that one occasion to express their possible more than friendship love. Interesting story that could been better if the film was tighter.",
         "Cons: ANOTHER INDIE LESBIAN MOVIE THAT ENDS THE WRONG WAY.. I would have rather seen them having a relationship and then breaking it up for a different reason. I felt like it was an okay movie, with some good jokes, and it deserved some other turning points. Pros: The photography is great. The beginning has some very tender images featuring nature and a very nice mom/daughter relationship... The performances are quite good!",
         "I saw a screening of \"Lovesong\" at Sundance. When someone sees a film at the biggest film festival in the world, there are involuntary expectations that the film should be something extraordinary. During the screening, this film made me uncomfortable, disappointed, and even angry. The main characters were so unlikable and uninteresting that I couldn't find any moments of enjoyment. Their dialogue was about as complex as a patch of dirt, and their delivery didn't help. Nearly everything about the film felt as amateur as could be. The end of the film was much better than the dreadful beginning. Some interesting characters emerged and some more advanced forms of comedy were introduced. It wasn't until hours after that I started to think that the film could've been purposefully horrible. I couldn't fathom that a female director could make such shallow female characters. The film reminded me heavily of \"The Comedy\". \"The Comedy\" is about an unlikable man, or boy if you will, that embraces his \"hipster\" lifestyle and anti-everything attitude even into his late 30's/early 40's. The movie wasn't enjoyable to a large portion of its viewers. I loved it, but I can understand why. It made fun of a huge population \"hipsters\" very subtly, masking it's insults inside of unlikable characters. \"Lovesong\" is appearing to do the same thing, except the joke is on unintelligent women and loneliness that turns into lesbian relationships. \"Lovesong\" may be the worst worst film, or the best worst film. It just depends on if this film is a legitimate drama, or one of the best played jokes since \"The Comedy\".",
         "Two vapid and thin leads with barely a shred of an adult conversation between them. Natural visual and editorial style aside, over the few years this story takes place, there's nothing here that teenage friends wouldn't exchange in half a lunchtime. Young teens at that. The lead character whines about having to look after her own child while being in the privileged position of not having to work. Sarah could take up study or indeed get a job and put her shockingly fed daughter into daycare, where hopefully the child receives some decent parenting. And one wholesome meal. Rather than take any sort of ownership over her life, Sarah bleats and cries. Victim-hood mentality. Woe is me. The actors do a competent job. Rosanna Arquette shamefully wasted here too. It's really the fault of the director, writers and producers. Superficial, whiny, self-involved, navel gazing, entitled, immature characters, without any redeeming qualities other than they look good. Perhaps we should be thankful they didn't talk more as they had nothing worthwhile to say anyway. Too long, even at eighty minutes. Tedious."
