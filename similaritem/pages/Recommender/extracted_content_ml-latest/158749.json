         "This is an incredible documentary, and really a must watch movie. It is showing what can be done by taking us back to raw foods. It is well made, very naturalistic, and whilst overtly emotional at times, it never descends into sentimentality. The results are dramatic, and the exercise is very profound. It was a real wake up call to what we are doing to ourselves, and is thoroughly recommended. Morgan Spurlock is featured in this movie and it is a great companion piece to his Super Size Me, almost a sequel to what happens if you live the opposite way to what he did in that movie. A great challenging movie.",
         "Docs simply don't get much better than this. The info is about as: important, relevant and hard to come by, as it gets. The presentation feels balanced and objective, with no hard-sell whatsoever. My other gripe with many documentaries I've seen, is that they seem to take a certain set of little known facts (which could easily be boiled down and shared in a minute or two) and find ways of drawing this information out over an hour and a half (using various techniques: somewhat self-conscious \"journey of discovery\" narratives, 50's clips, endless background information, etc.). Sometimes this works, but often it just feels like filler. This information however, decidedly fits the full-length documentary format like a glove. The human/emotional/psychological element depicted so well here, is simply indispensable to the story at hand. Impossible to communicate with \"just the facts ma'am\" (of which there is no shortage here either)."
