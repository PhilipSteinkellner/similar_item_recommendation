      "synopsis": "In 1967, a squad of military investigators in full NBC suits examine an African village where many are dead or dying. They depart in a helicopter and shortly after a plane flies toward the village and drops a fuel air bomb and immolates the entire area. White faced monkeys scurry off. Inside a high security lab people work in a variety of containment zones. Colonel Dr. Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman) is washing his dogs and gets a call from General Billy Ford (Morgan Freeman), a class 4 illness has been found in Africa, they want to get there before the WHO. Sam drops his dogs off at his estranged wife's house, she, Dr. Robby Keough, (Rene Russo) is moving to Atlanta for a job with the CDC. Loading up a Herc, Daniels is surprised one of his team is not there. Gen. Ford is there and gives Sam a file on his new man, Major Salt (Cuba Gooding). On the flight Daniels and Casey Schuler, (Kevin Spacey) quiz Salt, he has never seen a haemorragic fever up close. At a village, the team gets off helicopters, in full suits, to walk through a village. They enter a tent with many dead bodies. Salt sees a child with two dead parents and panics, tears off his helmet, a man arrives and says it is OK, it is not airborne. Daniels and the man discuss the illness, patient zero was a worker who went to work with the white man logging the Forest. The local juju man thinks this released an evil. The helos fly off as the village is torched. On the return flight, Daniels calms down a shaky Salt. Back home, Robby is upset she had to look after the dogs longer than planned. Sam agrees to give her both dogs as she moves to Atlanta. A ship sails across an ocean. Casey and Sam discuss Robby and prepare to enter the level 3 lab, Sam has not noticed a small tear on his suit. Casey chides him and makes a repair with duct tape. In the lab, Salt has isolated the Motaba virus and shows projections of how fast and deadly it is. The men are in awe. Ford goes to a class 3 lab and recovers samples from deep freeze.. General Donald McClintock (Donald Sutherland) and Ford see the results of the analysis, it is the same virus as 1967. McClintock wants it covered up and Daniels taken off the case. The next day Ford tells Daniels he is needed in New Mexico. DAniels argues they have already started gene mapping it. A young man, Jimbo Scott (Patrick Dempsey) takes a monkey from customs quarantine in San Francisco. Daniels calls Robby to issue an alert as all the test animals are dead, she refuses as he only has a hunch at this point. A man Rudy Alvarez works at a pet store and receives the caged white faced monkey, but refuses to buy it as he wanted a male, it scratches him and contacts another monkey. Robby discusses the alert with her boss, he dismisses it. Jimbo frees the monkey in the redwood forest. Jimbo is feeling sick on a plane, he gives a kid a leftover cookie, but his mother stops the kid from touching it. In Boston he greets and kisses his girlfriend, then faints. At the pet shop Rudy collapses and is taken to hospital, unresponsive. In a lab a distracted tech breaks sample vials and blood splashes in his face. After reading daily reports, Robby notices and decides to come to Boston. She tries to interview Jimbo but he dies. His girlfriend is also sick and soon dies. RR autopsies Jimbo and is shocked, she calls Sam to discuss. She knows Jimbo worked in a quarantine facility in San Jose. At a movie theatre Henry the lab tech coughs, then goes into paroxysms in the lobby. The monkey enjoys the wilderness and clear skies in California. Henry is in hospital but not quarantined. More sick people overwhelm the small hospital. Robby and her team cheer when the find out no one else on the plane has been sick, but then receive word of the California outbreak. Ford and Daniels argue, Sam wants back on the case but is being assigned to New Mexico. At the airbase Sam convinces the air tech his orders are changed to California. McClintock and Ford talk on the phone, McClintock urges they continue a conventional response and not reveal the 1967 info. A large army force enters and quarantines a small town, Cedar Creek. Robby and her team arrive escorted by police. In full suits they enter the hospital, she meets Sam there, he has assumed local command. There are many sick, from the movie theatre. They also find a man with pustules who has been sick a week. Daniels now suspects it is airborne. Gen. Ford meets an army Colonel Briggs (Dale Dye) who confirms they have a full cordon. Maj Salt shows the new strain is changed slightly. They discuss with Robby and suspect a host animal with two strains of the virus. Alvarez and the pet store seem to be a key. Daniels reports to Ford on the severity, 19 dead and hundreds sick, and is angry that Ford seems complacent. The media hovers and reports from the perimeter. Robby and an assistant break into the pet store, find a sick monkey but Robby says it can't be the host. In town, some locals try to break out in pickups but are shot up by the army with extreme force. Salt reports the monkey has the original strain. Sam says to keep testing and looking. The army starts a curfew and tightens control on the town. In the hospital Sam finds Ford there and a new intravenous drip, E-1101 being used. Ford says it is an experimental drug, he is trying to help. DAniels brings a E-1101 bag to Salt and asks him to find out what it is. A tearful woman leaves her house and is taken away in a Hummer. Sick people are being taken to a common site. Schuler looks at blood samples, numbers in the 600s, and angrily says all are positive, the entire town is infected. A tent city is built on the town sports field. Tensions rise as there is no record of any other monkeys or missing animals. In the portable Class 3 lab Schuler has a panic attack, he has cut his suit accidentally but doesn't tell Robby. At the Pentagon, Gen. McClintock describes a worst case spread of the infection. The men at the table discuss Operation Clean Sweep, firebombing the 2600 residents of the town. The Chief of Staff (JT Walsh) is angry and demands everyone agree unanimously for such drastic action. A barn is torched. The monkey arrives at the window of a sleeping girl. Ford and McClintock discuss the 1918 pandemic and other wartime bombings. McClintock has approval for Clean Sweep and says the town folk are casualties in a war. Robby and Sam are frustrated in how Jimbo got sick. Suddenly they notice the pet store monkey is alive and well. DAniels realizes E-1101 is a cure for the original strain, the army had it all along. Casey then goes into paroxsyms and is rushed to the hospital. Robby punctures her glove trying to give Schuler an injection and rushes to try and wash off. Daniel rushes to confront Ford, saying he could have stopped it earlier, they were trying to protect a perfect biological weapon. Ford tells Daniels they have to do their jobs, Sam realizes they will wipe out the town. Ford admits the President has given the order for later that day. Salt now calls Daniels to report Jimbo smuggled an animal from Customs. Gen. McClintock demands Daniels be arrested. Daniels warns Robby to leave town by 1800 hrs if no symptoms have shown. He reminds her all the troops are leaving. Daniels and Salt change into regular uniform and escape in a scout helicopter. McClintock says to shoot it down. Daniels and Salt arrive in San Francisco and demand customs records for every ship. They figure out the ship they want has just left harbour, they fly off in pursuit. At a house a mom asks her young daughter where the monkey came from in a crayon drawing she made. A nervous Robby checks herself for signs of illness. Salt finds the ship in heavy fog, he can't land but gets close for Sam to jump. He makes it. The crew are all Korean but understand he is a doctor, they show him a dead man in the freezer. Sam inspects the man's bunk and finds photos of him and a monkey. Casey is near death, Robby is looking flushed and holds his hand. Salt and Daniels arrive at a TV studio and barge onto the news set. They want help in finding the monkey and show photos. The mother realizes her daughter has seen the monkey. Salt and DAniels now fly to the house in Palisades. McClintock reams out Colonel Briggs and also flies out in a pair of gunship helicopters. Sam tries to convince the young girl to help them catch the monkey. Gen. Ford puts out a verbal message to all troops to do their duty, etc. The bomber plane begins to taxi. The girl calls for the monkey as the adults stay in the house. Daniels checks his watch. Salt has a tranquilizer pistol ready. He stumbles but takes his shot and gets the monkey with the dart. Daniels reports to Ford he has the host and to stop the bombing, Ford agrees to buy some time but to expect some resistance. Now McClintock in his helo lines up and threatens to shoot down the scout helo. The three helos have a low level chase in a river bed. Maj Salt, an expert pilot, escapes. They land in the deserted town Cedar Creek, Salt is to start making an antivirus in the portable lab. Sam suits up and goes to the hospital, Robby is now near death. Sam removes his hood and let's her touch his cheeks. Salt arrives with an IV bag, Sam hooks it up to Robby and tells Salt to make more. McClintock returns to the Command Post and re-issues the order to bomb the town. In the hospital Robby's vitals are coming back to normal. Salt says it is too late, the bomber is coming. They fly off in their scout helo to convince the bomber pilots. Daniels radios the bomber and tries to explain he has an anti serum, to abort the mission. Ford radios a clue in to fly into the path of the bomber. The helo hovers in the flight line and at the last second the plane veers and drops the bomb in the nearby ocean. Ford takes over from a hysterical McClintock and relieves him of command. Col Briggs arrests the General at gunpoint. In town, people are walking about. Robby wakes, Sam has had his dose of antiserum. The two reconnect.",

         "When I first saw this movie, I was ten, and even then I liked it. The script itself housed very funny one liners, particularly form Spacey's character. But I was amazed at how fast the film itself moved. In the first, you are following these scientists going to Africa to find a virus outbreak. Next thing you know, you're watching a helicopter go head on with a plane. First comes the acting. Dustin Hoffman is stupendous as always, Rene Russo plays Robbie with realism, Kevin Spacey makes for a good humor man, Cuba Gooding Jr. pulls off the green man trying to earn respect, and being a bad-ass at the same time. As always, Morgan Freeman is wonderful. Any role I see him in is a role I remember. He's always different, too, neigh does he ever repeat in characterization. Sometimes he's funny, sometimes he's incredibly serious. Last but not least comes Donald Sutherland, one of my favorite actors to date. He can jump into the shoes of any character, including the general trying to protect a secret he knows he shouldn't. One actor whom I particularly enjoyed watching was J.T. Walsh. It's a great shame he died, I liked all his stuff from Breakdown to Pleasantville. He is only in Outbreak for about five minutes, but he has one of my favorite monologues in the history of film. He commands attention as he speaks. Next comes the story itself. A very to-date story. A one all can relate to because it could very well happen. A virus from Africa makes its way here and begins infecting all, without a cure. I liked that there was a hero aspect in Sam Daniels. he was the tracker, the hunter, the curist. Coupled with the story comes the dialogue. Rich, under-appreciated, funny, and serious all wrapped into one. As I said before, the monologue for Walsh is brilliant. Many lines are etched into my mind, and are often used in conversation. Too bad no one knows what I'm saying. I'm a bit surprised this film didn't bode too well with audiences. Mayhap they didn't want to see what could happen, who knows? My only complaint is character endings. You insinuate what happens to McClintock and Ford, also Sam and Robbie, but we don't ever see Casey again. I could infer that he dies, but he could very well have survived. I wish there was a way to know. Finally comes Wolfgang Peterson's remarkable direction. I've been a huge fan of his movies since this movie, including Air Force One, Enemy Mine, not much for Perfect Storm, but his upcoming Ender's Game should be good. At the end, I felt a certain sense of relief and wonderment. But I have to say the soundtrack is rather exquisite. I have always liked James Newton Howard, and though the cd is short in time, it's a time I cannot forget. Particularly the end theme when it's chopper vs. plane time. What a song, keeps me in suspense every time. I like songs that are taken for film trailers as well. It's still too bad not a lot of people know about this movie. 9 out of 10",
         "This film was everything that many action thrillers are not. For one, the action really was thrilling at times. The story was well written and directed, and for a film that wasn't really \"over the top\" by action movie standards, there were many tense moments to enjoy. But what struck me the most was the cast. I mean, this is about as good a list of actors that you will ever find in one movie, and they all deliver, just as you would expect from all this talent. It's truly one of the most exciting movies that I've seen in some time.",
         "\"Outbreak\" isn't any kind of masterpiece, but worth seeing nevertheless. Portraying the army trying to contain a deadly virus brought by a monkey smuggled into the country, the movie seems especially relevant, what with bird flu and all. A particularly disturbing scene takes place in a movie theater, when a person coughs and the camera follows the particles catching on everyone's lips as they laugh, unaware of the fate that awaits them. The always dependable Dustin Hoffman plays as intense a role as ever as the colonel in charge of trying to control the virus. Rene Russo, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey and Cuba Gooding Jr. also play their roles very well. Donald Sutherland's menacing looks are perfect for the kind of character whom he plays. All in all, Wolfgang Petersen directs another good one here.",
         "Hoffman is a U.S. Army doctor who specializes in disease control, and is burdened with personal problems following a recent divorce. He and his research team have their work cut out for them when they're assigned to try and contain a new, terrifyingly deadly virus that's made its way from Africa and caused an unprecedented epidemic in a small U.S. coastal town. It's a race against time as they try and locate the host animal carrying the virus, as well as save the lives of the town inhabitants before his Army superiors can carry out their own agenda. Suspenseful, well-crafted thriller is not always surprising, but it is believable and acted with conviction by a dynamite cast. ***",
         "Outbreak (1995, Dir. Wolfgang Peterson) It's 1967 and there's a deadly outbreak of 100% mortality rate virus in Motaba River Valley, Zaire. The Valley is destroyed to prevent the virus from spreading, but 27 years later, the virus finds its way over to the USA aboard a monkey. This time though, the virus has evolved and is now airborne, as Col. Sam Daniels (Hoffman) races to not only prevent a virus epidemic but to prevent the destruction of Cedar Creek by the corrupt Maj. Gen. Donald McClintock (Sutherland). Great acting from its talented cast and superb storytelling make a well made film which hooks you into waiting for the final outcome. Story doesn't focus on the effects of the virus, but rather the hunt for the cure, which makes a far better film. You want a hotshot scope-jockey, fine, but, frankly, I'm hurt. \u0096 Maj. Casey Schuler (Kevin Spacey)",
         "With a deadly virus spreading like the Flu in the town of Cedar Creek, Military and Civilian Viral Specialists Dustin Hoffman and Rene Russo, are caught up in a race against time to discover a cure for this Microscopic Menace, known as Motaba. This isn't the first time that the virus has struck, but last time out is was hidden from the public and remained in the hands of the Military, as the perfect Biological weapon. Desperate to keep the Weapon Safe, Morgan Freeman and Donald Sutherland, will stop at nothing to protect it, even if that means killing innocent Civilians. With the cast already mentioned and support from Kevin Spacey and Cuba Gooding Jr. the film is packed with fine acting performances, and enough thrills and tension, to show us exactly how serious the threat of this weapon is, and the lengths that people goto, to preserve it. Very realistic in content, this is turns out to be a fine Dramatisation of a very real threat. 8/10",
         "When a disease in Africa is found , extreme measures are necessary to stop a rapacious epidemic , as dinky Colonel Sam Daniels (Dustin Hoffman) of the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases is sent to discover it . When he reports back to his chef officer General Ford (Morgan Freeman) and tells him that they should put out an alert on this disease but the General that since the disease is so far away and not airborne that it can't possibly reach the U.S . However, a monkey from that part of Africa was captured by a man (Patrick Dempsey) and brought the USA and tried to sell it but when the person he tried to sell it to rejected it he released it. Col. Daniels wants to look into it but General Ford denies his request so he turns to his estranged ex-wife (Rene Russo) , who works at the Center for Disease Control or CDC to look into and they discover it's the African disease but since it kills very quickly, Col. Daniels feels that it's been contained until another outbreak and learns the virus makes the bubonic pest look like a cough . The virus expands rapidly in the air like a common cold but the Army superiors have an agenda to their own . Meanwhile Hoffman must contain the virus that's somehow made its way from Africa to the USA and the events go awry . But military intelligence (Donald Sutherland) have other plans to avoid deadly virus in which a sub-continent the size of America may be consumed and decimated . Suspense thriller with plenty of action and intrigue about a deadly virus is spread in the air . The pictures results to be a metaphor for AIDS panic in the same way that 50s extraterrestrial films mirrored fears of Red Menace . The story shows the scientific methods by which such viral ills are identified and tracked , including touches on the ethical problems as germ warfare , elimination of infected and several others . Nice performance for all-star-cast as Hoffman , Russo , Morgan Freeman as a good general , Cuba Gooding Jr as intrepid official expert on helicopters , Kevin Spacey as helper and many others . Appears unjustly uncredited T.J Walsh as US President , Dale Dye and Lance Kerwin . Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Michael Balhaus , Clint Eastwood's usual . Stirring and adequate musical score by James Newton Howard . Good direction by Petersen who does have its thrilling moments , most of them in the first half , though the second half degenerates in a superhero movie in which Hoffman turning into an one army man -almost caricature and barely credible- against the military intelligence represented by nasty Donald Sutherland . Wolfgang Petersen has directed very good films since his beginnings in Germany with ¨The Neverending story¨ and ¨Das Boot¨ ,after that , he emigrated US where realized ¨Night of shattered crystals¨, ¨Enemy mine¨ , and the successful ¨Air Force one¨and ¨The patriot¨ , though his last film was a semi-flop , the remake ¨Poseidon¨. Rating : well worth watching , better than average .",
         "When a deadly virus decimates an African village, the US authorities attempt to draw a line under the incident and take the line that a reoccurrence is unlikely. However, a monkey has become a carrier for the virus and has reached the US. When Jimbo Scott smuggles the monkey out to sell to a pet store, he is infected and spreads it to others. Eventually the local town of Cedar Creek becomes overrun and the US form a barricade around the town. With the politicians planning the destruction of the town to stop the virus spreading, Col Sam Daniels and his team race to find some other way of stopping it. Whether you viewed in back in 1995 or now, where the threat of viral attack doesn't seem so unlikely, this film should be gripping on the basis of the material. At points it does have good moments but generally this generally suffers from trying to do too much and having a script that cannot control its subject. For most of the film the virus is almost a concept rather than a real threat and it talks a lot without really delivering. Even when an entire town is quarantined and dying, it all remains very calm where really it needed fear and panic to seep into every character and every scene. Sadly it doesn't do this and the film bogs itself down in personal infections, squabbling ex-partners and so on \u0096 did we need the main characters to get the virus? Wasn't it enough for an entire town to be dying and for the world to be at risk? Anyway, at the midpoint the film suddenly becomes an action movie with helicopter chases and a plot that can best be summed up as 'catch the monkey'. Even with this section, the flaws are rife \u0096 the action bits are OK but it seems unlikely that finding a monkey somewhere in the US would be a more complicated task! This is not to say that it isn't entertaining because it just about manages to be enjoyable enough, but nowhere near the potential that this had. Part of the reason is a plot that struggles from logic gaps and a lack of intelligence and urgency. The lack of intelligence comes from the film completely ignoring the moral complexities that come with such a situation \u0096 the film ignores the fact that bad things may need to be done to stop the virus and instead just paints good guys (save the people) and bad guys (bomb the people). The lack of urgency comes from the failure to really make the virus a threat; really I needed Cedar Creek to become the US in miniature \u0096 having everyone calm didn't do it for me and I needed more than just two cars making a break for it. But then the writing generally isn't up to the task and the heavy dialogue is pretty average at best with clichéd lines and far too much 'personal' stuff between the main characters. Even the main 'bad' guy is a fudge as it just paints everything black and white. Another reason that this doesn't live up to its potential is the sheer numbers of faces in the film. Hoffman makes a strange action star but he does OK with what little he is given. Russo is no good at all and happily has little to do but deliver the personal 'involvement' that the film cannot manage to deliver any other way. Gooding is pretty good in a semi-action role and Spacey has some good lines before he too becomes a cheap emotional device. Sutherland gives a by the numbers performance as he has nothing to really work with, but Freeman is more interesting because he does. It's just a shame that this talented cast were not used better in this film. An aside that was interesting to me was that Dale Dye has a minor role in the film while also serving as military adviser to the film. He is an interesting man because his career has grown from adviser to being a reasonable actor to becoming a writer, producer and (recently) a 2nd unit director \u0096 clearly a motivated and talented man who it would be interesting to listen to talk sometime. Overall the potential is there but it is unrealised. The cast are great on paper but have nothing to work with in a script that delivers average dialogue, no real characters, no moral ambiguities, no real involvement and no sense of scale or threat. It does have some pace at times and it has enough 'OK' moments to be worth watching maybe once but I was annoyed that the potential of the material alone was missed. I think the film can be summed up by the ending \u0096 one minute we have an exciting helicopter stand off and the next we have a pay-off that is so lazy and so simplistic that I was actually visibly annoyed by it. Passable entertainment if you are in an undemanding mood but it never even gets near the potential it had.",
         "Personally this film is in my top 10. It is a real treat of a movie to watch which not only acts as pure entertainment but also a deeply involving film which involves great performances and some real thrilling moments. It all starts with the wipe-out of an African village due to a deadly virus. However the virus is transported to the US by a small monkey which is smuggled by boat. The film then tracks along as more and more people get infected and the virus mutates making it airborne and more of a threat. \"It spreads like the flu\" The actors involved are Dustim Hoffman who as usual does an outstanding job. Rene Russo is used well as a love complication. Kevin Spacy is brilliant as the doctor with a sense of humour. Morgan Freeman and Donald Sutherland seem to be having fun with the material and things get interested when they clash at the end. The film, although thrilling at times (e.g a spectacular helicopter chase and an attempt to break out of the quarantined town) is extremely emotional as it does follow a few people as they are diagnosed with the virus. However, this is where the film also goes downhill a bit. We are expecting to see the chaos and mass panic of a virus infected town. However things seem abnormally calm, and I got fed up of main stars getting infected just to add to the pressure to Dustim Hoffman's character. But overall this film is brilliant, I strongly advise everyone tries to watch this. it isn't everyone's cup of tea but is still a brilliant film which I will treasure and keep in my top 10.",
         "Get the producer of PLATOON and the director of DAS BOOT to cast Hoffman , Freeman , Sutherland , Gooding Jnr and Spacey in a thriller about a killer virus and you`ll have a sure fire blockbuster hit . And OUTBREAK was a major hit at the box office but does this make it a good film ? In my opinion - no . Despite having an all star cast and massive budget and despite the very good pre titles sequence OUTBREAK is a bad movie. The main culprit for this debacle is Dworet and Pool`s script , it`s far too talky . Too much time is dedicated to talking about the virus and not enough time is shown just how awful the virus is . It`s made worse by the fact that when people do talk ( And boy they never stop talking ) only banal words come out of their mouths : \" Oh my gawd \" is very popular as is \" Gawd dammit \" and not forgetting \" Gawd help us all \" as they realise time is running out . Undoubtedly the most disappointing aspect to the script is when the town is put into quarantine , there`s no real attempt on the part of the screenwriters to bring moral ambiguity or blur the edges of right and wrong with this scenario . With a few rare exceptions the citizens comply with directives . Despite being an extremely unpleasant film THE CRAZIES made far better use of this speculative plot and its moral consequences unlike here where Donald Sutherland is the bad guy because he wants to firebomb a town to stop the virus spreading . If you were in his shoes what would you do ? Would you be a bad person for firebombing the town in order to save the world from the virus ? Ah but there`s a plot device that does show Sutherland`s character to be the villain of the piece so out goes any intelligent subtext as to what would be the right or wrong thing to do in such a situation . So just to sum up : despite its great cast and production team OUTBREAK is nothing special and at times feels like an overblown TVM"

         "In July of 1967, In Motaba River Valley, Zaire, a virus with a 100% mortality rate starts infecting people. The virus becomes known as the Motaba virus, and it's so deadly that it causes severe bleeding and liquefies internal organs, killing within 3 days. The virus wipes out Motaba River Valley, and a devastatingly huge fire bomb is dropped onto Motaba River Valley in order to reduce the chances of further infection. The bomb was dropped on the orders of corrupt General Donald McClintock, even though an army surgeon, General Bill Ford, was against the idea. 27 years later, in 1994, there is another outbreak in Motaba River Valley. At the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), located at Fort Detrick in Maryland, Colonel Sam Daniels is doing research on the Motaba virus, and so is his ex-wife Roberta Keough, who works at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. A monkey carrying the Motaba virus stows away on a ship that is heading for the USA, and after the monkey's arrival, people in Cedar Creek, California start becoming infected by the virus. Sam and Roberta head into Cedar Creek with fellow doctor Casey Schuler, and they start searching for the monkey, thinking that the monkey is the key to finding a cure. Along the way, Sam stumbles onto some information that may be of help -- McClintock has been concealing vital information from the president of the United States. Since 1967, McClintock and Ford have been in possession of E-1101, a serum that was made to cure the virus. McClintock has been trying to stop Ford from coming forward with this information, and so far, McClintock has succeeded. McClintock now wants to drop onto Cedar Creek the kind of firebomb that was dropped on Motaba River Valley 27 years ago. Sam and Roberta figure out that the virus in the Cedar Creek outbreak is a new strain of the Motaba virus -- an airborne strain that is even more contagious than the flu. When a new serum is made to stop the new strain, Sam and Roberta set out to stop McClintock from having the town blown up.",
         "A deadly airborne virus finds its way into the USA and starts killing off people at an epidemic rate. Col Sam Daniels' job is to stop the virus spreading from a small town, which must be quarantined, and to prevent an over reaction by the White House.",
         "A lethal virus is transported to the United States via an African monkey host. The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infections Diseases and the Centre for Disease Control are two Federal agencies headed by an ex-husband and his former wife rush to stop its deadly spread. Will they succeed?",
         "When a disease in Africa is discovered, Colonel Sam Daniels of the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases or USAMRIID, is sent to investigate. When he reports back to his superior officer General Ford and tells him that they should put out an alert on this disease but the General that since the disease is so far away and not airborne that it can't possibly reach the U.S. However, a monkey from that part of Africa was captured and brought to the U.S. and a man who works at the customs house took it and tried to sell it but when the person he tried to sell it to rejected it he released it. Later the man who arrived in Boston collapses and dies, Col. Daniels wants to look into it but General Ford denies his request so he turns to his ex-wife, who works at the Center for Disease Control or CDC to look into and they discover it's the African disease but since it kills very quickly, Col. Daniels feels that it's been contained until another outbreak!",
         "A virus similar to Ebola & Lassa is discovered in Africa in 1969. 25 years later, it resurfaces - and Col. Sam Daniels of the U.S. Army is sent in to investigate it. When he returns he warns his boss, Brigadier-Gen. Ford, of the lethal nature of the virus and wants to put out an alert. Ford, who had been one of the men who first dealt with the virus, insists the virus is contained and unlikely to show up in the U.S. What neither man knows is that the host - a monkey - has been brought into the U.S. by freighter. Through an under-the-table bribe, a young man gets the monkey out of the animal-testing lab it was bound for. Soon, the man is infected - and Col. Daniels' ex-wife, Dr. Keough - now with the CDC - is called into Boston when the young man is brought to a hospital in critical condition. Dr. Keough discovers that the man has died from the virus, and at the same time - on the other side of the country - a new outbreak is starting in a little California town. A quarantine is set up to stop the virus from spreading, while Ford's boss, the sinister Major-Gen. McClintock, has his own agenda in mind - to harness this lethal bug for use as a bioweapon. With the President about to order a fuel-air bomb to be dropped on the little town to stop the outbreak, Daniels must find a way to unravel McClintock's sinister plan...",
