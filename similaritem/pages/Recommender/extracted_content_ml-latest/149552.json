         "Greetings again from the darkness. If we need a poster child for independent film, perhaps this little gem from writer/director Trey Edward Shults should be the leading candidate. The film is daring and raw and proves that even a familiar theme can be interesting if the creative forces are allowed to do what they do best. And on top of that \u0085 it was filmed in 9 days with no \"stars\" and almost no money. The extended opening shot is a close up of only a woman's face. Her eyes are expressive and her lip begins to quiver. Her look could be described as unnerved, and with the ominous music playing, our mind leads us to believe we are headed towards a horror film. Oh, how right \u0085 and wrong \u0085 that initial impression proves to be. That woman is Krisha (played by Krisha Fairchild), a sixty-something year old who is joining her family for Thanksgiving dinner \u2013 after a 10 year absence. Of course, there are no shortage of family holiday dinner disaster movies, but most of the time they are either slapstick comedy or so stagey that the frustration never strikes a chord. Not so with this one. Tension is palpable in every scene. It's as if everyone is waiting for the proverbial shoe to drop. Krisha is a trainwreck as a mother, sister and person. She is an alcoholic and drug addict, though she proclaims herself healed. It's pretty obvious to everyone (except herself) that her best intentions are not firmly planted in reality \u0085 and the inevitable is only a matter of time. Old wounds are re-opened (though they were probably never closed), and a simple conversation on the patio or checking the timer for the baking turkey become near catastrophes. Mr. Shults has economically and effectively cast many of his own family members, and filmed in his mother's home outside of Houston. Krisha is his real life Aunt, and Robyn (who plays Krisha's emotionally devastated sister) is the director's mother. This is a story that works because of the realness of each moment. It feels like family members unloading on each other rather than two actors reciting lines. Krisha's swig of wine in the bathroom provides a moment of relief for both her and the viewer. Having been called \"heartbreak incarnate\" and an \"abandoneer\" \u0085 we even sympathize with her instinct to retreat to the bottle, though it's with dread and misery. Director Shults displays promise as a director who can capture a personal moment, no matter how awkward or painful. Krisha Fairchild has a Gena Rowlands on screen presence (very high praise) that delivers a touch of grounded realism to her words and actions. As a lover of independent films, here's hoping we see more from them both in the very near future.",
         "\"Krisha\" brings the story of the title character. As the movie opens, we see Krishna, a woman in her 60s, arriving with her suitcase at a house in suburban Texas. Turns out to be her sister Robyn's house, and the entire family is gathering for Thanksgiving, and also to celebrate the birth of a baby to Robyn's daughter. It is clear that this is Krisha's first time seeing most of them in a long time, and that during that absence she deal with personal issues. At this point we're maybe 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out. Couple of comments: this movie is a labor of love for Trey Edward Shults, who directed, wrote, edited and stars in the movie. Not to mention that this movie was made on less than a shoestring (primary funding came from a small Kickstarter campaign). In the first half of the movie, we witness how this family is enjoying their time together, even if it is straining for Krisha. But the second half of the movie truly delivers. One key scene after another unfolds, and will leave you nailed to your seat. There are a number of key performances, none more so than Krisha Faichild in the title role (most other characters also use their real life names in the movie). Check out the scene where she is reunited with her mentally frail mother, who looks to be in her 90s. Just wow. Robyn Fairchild as Krisha's sister is equally excellent. There is an interesting score courtesy of (for me unknown) Brian McOmber. This movie made quite a splash at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. No idea why it's taken over a year for this to finally get a release in theaters, but better late than not. \"Krisha\" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great. That is a darn shame. This is a top notch if heavy duty family drama which deserves a larger audience. If you have a chance to see this, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, by all means do not miss it! \"Krisha\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",
         "I don't know where that \"comedy\" label on IMDb comes from. I don't think it functions even as a black comedy. Absolutely heavy and quite dark, but fabulously written, directed, and acted. There are many films that deal with this sort of premise (even Rachel Getting Married comes to mind) but this really took it to another level. Completely immersive, watching it all unravel just hurts to watch. Not an easy viewing by any means and definitely one that will divide audiences completely (even on this board, I can see many people hating it). I loved it though, easily one of the best of the year so far. Krisha Fairchild should absolutely be in contention for end-of-the- year awards, and Trey Edward Shults shows a lot of talent.",
         "Like \"La Cienaga\", this movie has a veracity and intimacy that will freak out most self- appointed film critics (and I'm not one). If you can't handle domestic pain, tension, and heartbreak then don't watch it. As a big fan of Dostoyevsky I found it riveting and powerful. After viewing I immediately sought out the back story and wasn't surprised to learn the cast/family are actual family members. I don't think a filmmaker could achieve what Shults does with an all-actor cast. It matters not a whit to me that he used family members or that you can foresee an inevitable train wreck in the making toward the end of Act 2. A great film, and the audio effects are superb, especially in the kitchen scene and the use of a Nina Simone track to score Krisha's high flying cookoff.",
         "The first shot of \"Krisha\" is a slow zoom into the titular characters face, with ominous, rising music in the background. The preceding scenes (and the fantastic introductory long take) show that Krisha is coming home to family that she hasn't seen in a while on Thanksgiving day, and has good intentions for her visit. But this mood of uncertainty established in the opening shot rises throughout the movie. Even though Krisha is simply participating in usual small talk towards the beginning of the film, the unpredictable soundtrack, frantic movement of the camera, and the performances of the characters suggest Krisha isn't stable. The film is very subtle and deliberate in what it reveals to us about this family and Krisha's past. The film starts after much has already happened with her character, and many things are revealed about her throughout the film, but most are just suggested. She has problems in her past that have affected her whole family, and her sudden visit to them intends to make up for those problems. The camera and aspect ratios tell us a lot about the state of Krisha's character. At first the camera movements are frantic but fluid, showing Krisha is in control, but could lose it at any moment. Then the camera is shaky and the aspect ratio narrows, with two black bars at the top and bottom, showing Krisha is on the verge of breaking, relapsing into alcoholism. Then the aspect ratio boxes her in and the editing and camera movements are spastic, showing her isolation and inability to escape it. While the cinematography tells a lot about Krisha, the actress portraying her, Krisha Fairchild, really tells the most. Her repressed suffering is evident with this actress. This is the type of film where all of the actors make each scene feel natural and incredibly realistic. They seem like real people in a family we could know, and that's part of what makes the film so brutal. Krisha is a devastating, deeply emotional character study and one of the best films of 2016.",
         "For reasons never made entirely evident, 60-something Krisha has willfully severed ties for several years with her family, including a now young adult son. She decides to reconnect with her kin for Thanksgiving dinner at the suburban home of her sister and her family. I grew up in a suburban Texas community not unlike the one which serves as the setting for the entirety of \"Krisha\". As such, I can almost literally sense the air, smell the scents and feel the sensibility of the space these characters inhabit. I have lived it. The memories for me are lasting. And they are abundantly good. Not so in this mostly morose and melancholy scenario. Veteran but still little-known actress Krisha Fairchild (\"The Killing of John Lennon\" representing one of a handful of somewhat recognizable credits) delivers remarkable and wrenching work here. Fairchild is exceptionally effecting as she gives us a deeply troubled profile of an irrevocably tortured soul riddled with substance abuse, self loathing, uncontrollable anger and crippling regret. This is a mysterious woman to be sure. Where exactly has Krisha been for all of these years in estrangement? What is it that has occupied her life during this time of indistinct purpose? Krisha reveals only vague hints and innuendo to various members of an uncomfortably skeptical family. Observing the holiday festivities and camaraderie carry on all about her, she remains remote, detached, never engaging in any of it, focusing instead almost exclusively and at her own insistence on preparing the super-sized turkey for that evening's meal. The very characteristics that make Fairchild's portrayal so riveting are the same traits that make this excruciatingly conflicted character so dreadfully off-putting. Because we do not come to know practically anything at all about why Krisha ever abandoned her family in the first place, we never have a frame of reference for why she would ever even choose to do this. This confounding ambiguity leaves us feeling as distant from Krisha as she is from her own flesh and blood relatives. How can we genuinely invest in and grow to care for a person about whom we know virtually nothing and who has given us no compelling reason to do so? We feel very sorry for Krisha, sure. But beyond that we are inspired to generate little if any emotion beyond pure pity. Technically, much of the key speech in \"Krisha\" was extremely difficult to make out, either as a result of it being overly hushed or garbled as characters talked over and above each other. I by and large appreciate natural dialogue as it is spoken in \"real life\" in most films, a dynamic that first time feature Writer and Director Trey Edward Shults was clearly striving for in his project. But when it is impossible to decipher what is being said, even after rewinding and replaying these scenes as I was able to do, the overall effect which you are efforting to achieve is unfortunately, and frustratingly, lost in translation. Moments involving Krisha and her wheelchair-bound mentally fragile mother, and what should have been a memorably moving interchange between Krisha and her long-suffering sister toward the end of the picture, are two especially conspicuous examples of these audio recording shortcomings really hurting the overall impact of the story. Shults's choice to employ a constant instrumental undercurrent of enormously edgy electronica for the first several minutes of \"Krisha\" certainly serves it's purpose of establishing an atmosphere of palpably building tension. But soon the moody music devolves into an overdone distraction, eventually becoming simply an ill-advised artistic affectation. This is criticism reasonably forgivable for a rookie from a personal perspective. But ideally they are lasting lessons learned in what, even with these missteps, looks to be a considerably capable career. This is a depressing movie. Unrelentingly so. And I know from depressing flicks, having seen my share of them over the years. However, there aren't many among this gloomy group that I would rank above \"Krisha\". In the end, nothing is clarified and nothing is resolved in \"Krisha\". Consequently, as an audience we are left with no appreciable degree of either resonance nor redemption. Only a sad and sour familial holiday experience. And, though granted generally not this extent, haven't we all in our own lives had our fill of at least some manner of domestic dysfunction? Watching somebody else's tumult and torture and classifying it as worse than one's own is not exactly a superlative barometer for satisfying cinematic consumption. I'm giving \"Krisha\" a charitable 6 out of 10, almost entirely, and quite candidly, because the film was shot in The Lone Star State and out of high regard for Fairchild's arresting performance.",
         "As an aspiring filmmaker, I cannot help but feel as if I relate to the debut filmmaker Trey Edward Shults. This film is heavily stylized and intense, and I feel that if I were able to make my own low budget film it would turn out to be something like this. The film focuses on extreme emotions, making the audience feel somewhat warm and humored at first, but completely crushed by the final shot. The film is overall extremely ambitious in its approach, due to Shults' use of long takes, black humor, and an atmosphere that contains both heavy realism and surrealism. \"Krisha\", one of the finest and funniest films to come out last year, is not only a beautifully made film but also the most earth shatteringly heartbreaking portrait of addiction since \"Requiem for a Dream\". It takes place during Thanksgiving as a family prepares for the holiday. One somewhat special member of the family has visited this year, Krisha, an old woman who has been absent of their presence for 10 years. This brilliant, harrowing shocker combines elements of humor and horror to craft a modern miracle. Unfortunately, this masterpiece is quite obscure and underrated-but I must urge anyone stumbling across my review to check it out immediately! It is a jaw droppingly fantastic work of art. I'd also like to comment on the fact that I believe this is definitely a comedy-drama. Other users have stated clear confusion about this film being listed as such, and I understand. The second half of the film is so damn depressing and brutal that it takes away from the wonderful humor of the first half. There's tons of laugh out loud moments in the beginning, but by the ending you're too shocked and sad to really remember them. However, the humor is strong enough for me to believe that billing it as a comedy-drama isn't misleading in the slightest.",
         "Don't let the plot synopsis fool you. First-time writer-director Trey Edward Shults has managed to craft a unique and absorbing family drama from a premise which appears mundane and conventional on the surface. Krisha Fairchild is magnificent in the lead role, and the mostly non-actor cast add a heightened sense of honesty and realism to the drama, which can make for engrossing, if at times uncomfortable viewing. However, what makes Krisha truly stand out is the cinematography and score. With an opening shot lasting about six minutes, it's clear from the start that this isn't your run-of-the-mill family drama. The camera is used in ways that can sometimes call attention to itself, but is always in service of the story. The rattling score permeates the film with a feeling of dread and anxiety which, with the camera-work, really makes us feel what the title character is feeling. While Krisha is not a perfect film (although the opening 20-30 minutes come close), it manages to feel unique and original in ways I didn't think would be possible in 2016. This is the most pleasant surprise of the year, and I can't wait to see what Shults does next.",
         "(Flash Review) This was a tough tale to watch to play out. A supposedly recovering alcoholic and substance abuser, who has avoided her family for a long time do to erratic behavior, gets invited to a large family dinner. Even from the start, you can see the ominous writing on the wall by the sounds she hears in her head and how she perceives the crowded and bustling house accentuated by clever cinematography. As the event goes on, her emotional state and anxiety begins to ramp up. Will she be able to keep her emotional state in check or will she fall back to her old ways? This movie was not super fun to watch because it was depressing and highlights this type of person's problems and how they affect others around her. This was well-made and had an independent film feel. But in the end, I was left with nothing to take away or ponder. What was the director's message?",
         "Trey Edward Shults' feature film debut is a competently crafted drama that's brought to life out of almost nothing. It very much feels like a homemade video made during a family gathering, and the casual set of events that unfold in the movie only add more authenticity to it. Krisha tells the story of its titular character, an elderly woman with a troubled history who returns to her family on Thanksgiving as a reformed lady after being estranged from them for many years. But demons from her past threaten to ruin the family reunion and her own self-improved image. Written, directed & edited by Trey Edward Shults, Krisha instils a sense of foreboding from its very first frame and while it takes plenty of time to set up the whole premise, there is something sinister brewing beneath the surface at all times, and Shults is able to keep that aura alive throughout the runtime. There are plenty of long takes here, capturing casual conversations & stuff that one would expect in a social gathering yet each scene brims with a feeling that something could go wrong anytime. Performances are no slouch as Krisha Fairchild plays the eponymous old lady brilliantly and is nicely supported by others. On an overall scale, Krisha is well-crafted & firmly told but Shults takes a tad too long to switch to next gear and much of the earlier excitement fizzles away by the time earlier wounds open again. It's a good effort for a first feature and bit experimental as well but Krisha as a whole fails to leave a memorable impression. Worth a shot anyway.",
         "Krisha goes to show how easily suckered critics are these days, its reception has left me baffled. There's no depth to this film, only the illusion of it. No 'brave new voice', just a few formal flourishes, certainly nothing stylistic you haven't already seen. There's no shade or development to Krisha's character whatsoever; despite the best efforts of the actor, we leave the film knowing the same information about her as when we began. When there is neither plot or character progression (certainly not prerequisites for good cinema in my book) a film has to arrest the viewer with something else. In this case, if viewing a sustained single note of miserablism is what thrills you, it's right here, knock yourself out. Personally, I found the dread tone and nausea effective for around thirty minutes, at which point I wanted more. I wanted to watch A Woman Under the Influence and Festen again.",
         "Preface: I love movies, especially independent. I am a social worker, so I love family and relationship dynamics. Although I didn't expect it to be a comedy, this movie should not be listed in the comedy/drama category. This movie was just dreadful. I was afraid it would literally give me nightmares after seeing a late night showing. I understand that it is trying to give you an inside look into someone's life/brain who has some sort of mental illness, but there was absolutely no explanation or resolution. It was very hard to watch (and listen to), and perhaps that was it's intent, however, I could not get into any of the characters and the movie went nowhere. It honestly was one of the most painful movies I have ever sat through, but the pain wasn't because of it's honesty or struggles that the characters went through.",
         "Where to begin? . . . . Cinema, at its best, is an experience. It is a medium through which the viewer is engaged; titillated, repulsed, shocked, confounded, angered, humored or otherwise incited to feel any number of emotions among the spectrum of the human experience. As an avid movie- watcher, it is sometimes easy to forget the potential and power of the medium. Going into the film, I knew close to nothing: something about a thanksgiving dinner complicated by an estranged and drug-addled family member. I had no expectations other than to be entertained, which has unfortunately become the basic function of most mainstream filmmaking. One and a half hours later, I was absolutely floored. Mouth agape and scrambling to find out who the cast and director were, as well of the title of an immaculately applied Nina Simone track in one of the most poignant scenes I remember having seen in a long time. The film's 27-year-old director (writer and editor to boot) Trey Edward Schults exhibits such a masterful technical literacy in the editing and execution of this film, it is hard to believe that it is his first feature. I am so pleased to see a filmmaker who is so consciously aware that the camera, not the actors, is the primary storyteller. It reminds me that the director is still the auteur, and not just a shot-manager who is paid to dress up performances. Even so, Krisha Fairchild's performance will forever be burned into my brain. It is not always easy to watch, as it surely was not easy to perform, but even if the film's execution had been otherwise mediocre, it would still be worth the rental price to watch this gem in action. I hope I've piqued any prospective viewers' interest. I will keep it short from here on out. I give the film 9 out of 10 stars for several reasons. 1. Aforementioned Shults' direction and Fairchild's performance. 2. The film's testament to the fact that vision and execution will always trump budget and star- power. Let that be a lesson to the industry! 3. The soundtrack is unique and extremely emotionally manipulative. I hope Mr. Schults will grow and continue to do very promising things in the future. I also hope that other young independent film-makers like Shults will emerge, paying homage to the greats (as Shults seemed to have done with the Shining here) while offering their own novel and idiosyncratic language. Bravo.",
         "I'm a struggling filmmaker myself in a third world country, that's why I didn't want to keep looking for inspiration in films with budgets I'd probably never get myself. I chose to watch Krisha because I wanted to see how can a low budget movie get so many praise and oh lord, now I understand. It turns out all you need is a crap load of talent. Trey builds such a fresh and unique storytelling for what we can say is a story told too many times. I loved it so much I just had to re watch it again right away... 3 times in a row! I love the details of the characters, the tricky staging and movement. If you've worked with amateur actors, you should be very impressed with the scene where Krisha comes downstairs to find a really loud, crowded and messy living room. Trey gives a reason to the movements and actions every character makes, these details are telling the backstory. It's pretty smart to compare the scene where Chase and Logan are arm wrestling with the building tension and subtle \"wrestling\" in the conversation between Krisha and Doyle. It's not constructed in an obvious parallel meaning, so that was nice. This movie has a lot of layers you'd probably won't see at first. The first person who welcomes Krisha is Alex, the only one who doesn't know her in the family. He's the one who opens the door for her, not the other members of the family. They are far and unaware she's there. Then we see Robyn, who is behind the dog gates, they hug through this gates but then Robyn breaks them so she can be with her sister. She's letting her guard down and breaking the walls between them. Only after she does this, we see the other family members come to her and receive her as if nothing ever happened. When Trey comes, his first line is \"What happened to the gates?\". A truly smart question to make in a situation like this one. What happened to the emotional walls? He means. Another clever meaning for the dog gates separating and protecting the dining room, supposedly from the dogs. But then we find out the wine is hiding in this room. Might these dog gates also be there to avoid Krisha from entering that room? I could go on and on about the wonderful details I've been finding, but I can't keep writing because I feel the need to watch this movie for the 5th time.",
         "This movie is a depressing, well-shot trip full of heart-pounding music. The shots are long and flowing, depicting the downward mental spiral of a crazy old woman. I'd call this a thriller. Its worth watching just to experience the mild insanity of this thanksgiving gathering. Mundane scenes in this short slice-of-life story are intensified by an incredible soundtrack. This movie doesn't have much in the way of a plot or script, and is heavily reliant on stunning visuals. This story is a sad one and not for everyone, but if you're interested, then this is worth a watch.",
         "After an absence of a decade a 60 year old woman who is a recovering addict returns for a family gathering for the Thanksgiving holiday. The stress of the situation leads her to return to her addictions, resulting in an even worsening scenario. Krisha is an unrelentingly depressing viewing experience. Its central character is well played but she is a person I found basically somewhat difficult to care about very much at all. What we know is she has allowed her personal habits to take precedence in her life and she has chosen them over her family, who she has abandoned. I found it quite easy to understand why the extended family members were reluctant to embrace her fully. So from the get-go I guess I had a problem with this one, as in a serious drama such as this it helps massively if you care for the predicament of the central character, at least in some way, but I found myself ambivalent at best. During the course of the film Krisha remains an outsider within the family unit. We never know exactly what she has done in the past exactly but it would be fair to assume she has messed up pretty bad. The film is quite successful, however, in presenting the anxieties that large family gatherings can bring about even at the best of times, and it does play upon this quite universal feeling quite well. The director and cast all seem to be actual family members themselves and all sport their real first names, so it's a pretty personal affair that is for sure and it does achieve a certain claustrophobia and intensity at times. The director also experiments with differing aspect ratios and a dissonant score, both of which I can't say I cared for too much. While this film does achieve a certain realism with its raw approach, I can't say I liked it very much. It wasn't what I would classify as either entertaining or informative really. Just a downer but not in a good way.",
         "This is not a film. This is 83 minutes of torture. If you can honestly sit through its entire length and come out with a positive experience you are a true die-hard. Tension is built around organic and often unexpected moments between characters yet I never felt surprised. Every scene was predictable in a way that felt forced. I was cringing more at the horribly drawn-out scenes where nothing but silence happened or where we're just being shown blank interactions without focus, totally unnecessary. I also couldn't get Ellen Burstyn's face out of my head constantly reminding me of how much better Requiem for a Dream was after the opening scene. Things happened too slow for me to feel connected. I was really hoping for more from this. I spent many years estranged from my mother after her divorce and subsequent drug addiction. I can totally connect with the emotional context but I was disappointed at how empty the story was shown to the viewer. It felt more as if this film was ad- libbed by the family who acted it out rather than having a writer's grand vision. It's pretty much impossible for me to see how others have given this movie praise. There are far better indie/low-budget dramas with compelling and well portrayed stories than this amateur outing. I hate to be so negative but I literally FORCED myself to finish this just so I could legitimately write a bad review. Yea.",
         "I really wanted to like this film. I commend the filmmakers in trying to make a film that is different and relatable. The opening scene is inexplicably haunting. It is the sound of death and the face of a woman with pain and heartbreak and loss seared in her face, looking ready for death. And then the film starts and it is about Krisha coming to visit for Thanksgiving dinner. The whole film is based on that 1 or 2 days. I give the film 10/10 for atmosphere. It really builds up an expectation of something that will happen. But nothing really happens. I mean sure, it would be interesting for the family if this was a real-life event. But for a outside viewer, we need more darker secrets and twists. Otherwise it just seems like a Thanksgiving dinner in a slightly more dysfunctional family than most. But meh.. it's hardly breathtaking. So well done filmmakers for starting the film well and giving a good atmosphere. And the cast are fantastic. But this film needs a remake with a different middle and ending and it could then be something really amazing.",
         "I admit it, too raw and intimate for me. The accompanying soundtrack makes it feel like a horror film. Which, in many ways, it is. And I hate horror films. It is a dysfunctional family drama set during Thanksgiving in Texas, after all. I feel like horror films work because they are detached from reality enough for us to, well, not walk out of the theater feeling depressed. This was a real life horror film. It definitely took an original approach to a genre film. Almost every scene has palpable tension. Atmosphere is on point. I found it difficult to be completely invested in the film. Well made, I can agree. But not my type of film.",
         "I love Indies! I'm myself an independent filmmaker. But I hate twisted dysfunctional people vomiting their nonsense within the garb of offbeat movies! I mean what the hell was the point of this film. There is this neurotic, troubled loser of a woman torturing us for 83 minutes. Such people need help, not glorification through films. Not sure what was going on in the minds of Cannes or SXSW jury to award this film with so many accolades.",
         "This is not going anywhere. Annoying music, annoying people. Very superficial acting. Nothing looks professionally done. You can make a home movie of your own Thanksgiving dinner, it should be better. 5 minutes of watching would have been enough, I pushed to 40 and I still regret that decision. I give a 1 for the good looking dogs. So we get the trick : raise $14K online, film your own family at Thanksgiving dinner in your parent's house, spend the money on the dinner, cigarettes and booze, there we are : you've become a filmmaker. Next time clean the house too, raise $100 more for a maid. Even difficult to write 10 lines for IMDb. End of it.",
         "Shot like a home movie and just as interesting you would be better off doing just about anything than watching this pointless mess. Masturbate or rob a store. Literally ANYTHING. Every conflict in this film is presented with so little context that it makes it impossible to care about and there is no real narratite through line, just a collection of scenes that seem to be picked at random at times. I would say more but there is nothing to talk about. I want my 83 minutes back.",
         "Well done effort and movie for small independent film. I saw this several months ago. Krisha has demons and a destructive past and has wreaked havoc on her family's emotional reserves for years. Krisha shows up to a holiday dinner expecting all to be well but the family has resentments and pain and cannot forget and forgive so easily. This film can be uncomfortable. This family is on the edge. The tension is palpable. Overall great film that depicts the addict/emotionally needy and dysfunctional family well.",
         "Garbage in the purest sense of the word. Watching this tremendously dysfunctional garbage would be like watching someone being hanged. WHY, in Gods name, would anyone want to watch this? A movie should bring you happiness, fear, enlightenment, excitement, etc. etc. Watching this movie just makes you want to take a hot shower so you can just get if off of you. I have NO Idea how anyone could watch this ugliness and rate it higher than a 3...at most. To each his own, I guess, but take my word for it and skip this mess. It's not worth one minute of your time.",
         "I am going to give you a PLOT SPOILER review (not ending) as I think knowing the mystery enhances the story. Krisha (Krisha Fairchild) attends the family get together at Thanksgiving. She has been gone a long time. Very long. Her son Trey (Trey Edward Shults) ended up being raised by her sister (Victoria Fairchild) and she wants to reconnect. We see Krisha sneaking around the house checking draws etc. and I didn't know if she planned on poisoning everyone or was really a man with an operation. As it turns out this is a story about her alcohol addiction- there that was the plot spoiler. The house is filled with commotion and the soundtrack is just piano and drum noise making the audience feel the commotion too. It grips you. The emotions run high in the film as it envelops the viewer and makes them uneasy and tense. It is a Lifetime drama on steroids, if you like that type of thing. Guide: F-word. Porn is playing on the TV of which we get a distant glimpse, but get to hear the groans."
