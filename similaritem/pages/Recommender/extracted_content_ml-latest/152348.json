         "David Dhawan has made several remakes like CHOR MACHAIYE SHOR(Blue Streak), KYO KII MAIN JHUTH NAHIN BOLTA(Liar Liar), KUNWARA( A Walk in the clowds) This is however a bad remake of ANALYSE THIS The story does seem interesting and initial scenes show promise but the film stagnates and the comedy comes across poor in the second half The Sanju vs Ajay track is treated so badly The Amitabh-Sanju track has some interesting though clichéd scenes Nothing new or effective and there is no continuity in the film Direction by DD is bad Music is okay Amitabh Bachchan does his part well though he does irritate at times Sanju repeats his gangster act and has good chemistry with Bachchan though he does ham it up in second half Ajay looks ill at ease, sleepy in the role Aishwarya is only a plastic doll here Annu Kapoor and Satish Kaushik are funny Navin Nishol and others are okay",
         "I am great fan of Billy Crystal, De Nero and Amitabh. And would have loved to see desi version of Analyze This. But the way this movie has churned into - its a piece of crap. There are so many holes in the movie that make you wonder what made great actors like Amitabh, Sanjay Dutt, Ajay Devgan and Aishwarya agree to be a part of this project. Wonder why was Sanjay Dutt cast as the don and Amitabh as the Doctor!!! Have we forgotten Deewar or Agneepath? Does it stand anywhere close to Vaastav? And added to that we have such stupid songs \"Yeh Kya Ho Raha Hain\" which only David Dhawan could conceive. As for the comedy, excuse me!!! Pathetic is not the word. And the way Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan try to outdo each other, please come up with something better. I mean, you have such a great star-cast and such a weak story! Aptly said \"All foam no beer\". An ideal star-cast would have been Amitabh (for Robert De Nero's role) and Naseer (for Billy Crystal). And cut out the formula romantic track.",
         "\"Hum Kisi Se Kum Nahin\" is an Indian remake of the Hollywood film \"Analyze This\". However, at three hours, the remake is considerably longer--as they've added other subplots that were not in the original film. While I often like long films, the remake seemed padded and stretched considerably. Munna Bhai (Sanjay Dutt) is a gangster who is feared by everyone. He's a really nasty guy, yet inexplicably, when he sees a beautiful woman (Kamal--played by Aishwarya Rai) and she yells at him for his violent behavior, he's smitten and loses his mojo. His mojo, in this case, is his ability to kill and threaten others--which is a severe detriment to a gangster. So, he seeks professional help from Dr. Rastogi (Amitabh Bachchan). Soon, Munna Bhai comes to rely on the Doctor and even follows him when the Doc goes on vacation! What Munna and the Doctor don't know is that the beautiful woman what Munna is so smitten with is the Doctor's sister! This is a serious problem as the sister is supposed to marry either a family friend's son or Raja (Ajay Devgn). However, when Munna discovers this, the answer is simple--kill or threaten all of her suitors! What can the Doctor and his sister do to avoid becoming part of the family? My biggest complaint about this film is that is isn't funny--a SERIOUS problem when it's supposed to be a comedy. Likewise, the romance isn't very romantic. My advice is watch the original or a different film of any of the stars, as all four are very talented and have done better things. Overall, the film was too long and unsatisfying to make it worth three hours of my life, though it's not a horrible film--just a bit disappointing and overly long. *I noticed one reviewer called it a 'Desi' film--and Desi refers to the culture of the region of India and the surrounding countries in case you were curious. Also, throughout the film they kept calling a semi- automatic pistol a revolver. A revolver is different, as the bullets revolve in a round cylinder. Not a major mis-translation, granted.",
         "um, Ajay please don't do any more such favours in the future! This film is purely for fans of one of more of the main characters namely: Aishwarya Rai, Amitabh Bachchan, Ajay Devgan and Sanjay Dutt. The script, I've read is a copy of Robert Deniro's 'Analyze This' but while I've never seen the Deniro version, I can only imagine that it is the better version. Sometimes, when a Bollywood film stinks, the songs in it come out and save the day, too bad I can't say the same for this film. The only thing good about it, is Aishwarya Rai and her beautiful retro clothes, thin figure and magnificent dancing! The rest, as I should say is crap. My 7 point vote and review is strictly for Aishwarya. Even Amitabh could not save this!",
         "\"Hum Kisi Se Kum Nahin\" is an entertaining copy of the De Niro / Crystal-comedy \"Analyze This\". Macho-man Sanjay Dutt is wisely casted in the De Niro role (both performances live from the image the viewer has of the actors) while Crystal's role is played by Amitabh Bachchan. That casting might not be obvious in the first place, but \"Big B\" makes the character his own rather soon and we go along with it. He is of course not anywhere as funny as Billy Crystal, but Bachchan has other qualities that make his appearance a good one. Director Dhavan and writer Bhatt (\"Ajnabi\", \"Mela\") focus more on the complex web of relations than on the comedy. There are more story lines in \"HKSKN\" than in \"Analyze This\", boosting the film's length to a Bollywood-friendly 163 minutes. However, this is not always to the film's advantage. As much as I like Ajay Devgan, I thought his whole plot line is rather unessential to the film. He acts well and I liked seeing him, but if one thing had to go, it would be his role. That leaves me with one other player: The always stunning Aishwarya Rai. Nobody faints more beautiful than she does - and her dance in a miniskirt will sure amount to a couple of heart attacks among the male audience. She's just a pleasure to watch and acts her part full of life. She's definitely a huge plus in \"HKSKN\". However, because the story is already well known and because the ending is pretty weak, I'd stick with a rating of 6/10",
         "My early review was favourable towards this movie apparently. I just watched this movie again recently. Not a good movie. are my RATINGS: Performance: Amitabh Bachchan -- 7/10 (Some of the comic scenes work...some don't) Sanjay Dutt -- 6/10 (nothing funny given to him) Ajay Devgan -- 8/10 (manages to make some unfunny moments funny) Aishwariya Rai -- 3/10 (has nothing much to do) Paresh Rawal -- 7/10 (good in small role) Other Supporting Actors -- 5/10 (not much funny with 'em) OVERALL -- (ROUNDED) 6/10 Story -- 1/10 (wtf is the story???) Screenplay -- 1/10 (total mess) Lyrics -- 1/10 (not impressed) Music -- 2/10 (except for one song, it fails to impress) Direction -- 1/10 (the movie's lost (pun intended)) OVERALL ----- (ROUNDED) 1/10 It's only getting 2 because of the decent performances largely let down by the crap everything else..."
