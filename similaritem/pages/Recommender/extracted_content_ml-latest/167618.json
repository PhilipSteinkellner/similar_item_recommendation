         "This is one of the worst films i have ever seen! I was so unfortunate to watch it on one boring afternoon on cinemax. I almost threw up. This is supposed to be a kids movie. Munchie totally screwed over that kid. He gave them twenty-thousand counterfeit dollars and he said his mom would get a new job. Yeah right..., we will never know what that lil b**tard is up to. He is friggin evil.",
         "I just don't see how a Concorde-New Horizons film directed by Jim Wynorski and featuring the acting talents of Andrew Stevens and a puppet could be bad. It just boggles the mind, doesn't it? Well, let's make no mistake about it. \"Munchie Strikes Back\" is indeed a bad film. Munchie is a puppet who has been around for many centuries. For reasons not fully explained until the end of the film, he is sent to Earth to help a single mother and her son. The mom's problem (her main problem at least) is that she has a balloon payment due on her mortgage in two weeks...to the not-so-tiny tune of $20,000. Ouch. She can't come up with the money because she just got fired. OK...JUST is the key word in that sentence. What the...? Was she planning on paying it off with a single paycheck? Maybe it would've been a good idea to have spent the last several years saving up for it...ya think? Munchie has magical powers similar to those a genie would possess...but there isn't a limit on the number of wishes you can make! Munchie gets the boy a bunch of fancy stuff for one night but then the kid asks for it to be sent back to the mall Munchie was \"borrowing\" it from. The annoying furball also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by means of cheating. A baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the Earth several times. Sadly, those dumb parents watching the game don't think it's at all strange. Hmm. Anyway, I'd like to wrap this up because this has already drained away enough of my lifeforce as it is. You'll be truly moved by the scene where Leslie-Anne Down, playing the mother, kicks a dog which is yapping at her. Your heart will melt at her charm when she notices dollar bills fluttering down on her front yard and she wonders how it could be snowing during the summer. \"Munchie Strikes Back\"'s credits promised another film to follow entitled, I believe, \"Munchie Hangs Ten\". To date, the movie viewing public has been robbed of what would surely have been a cinematic tour de force. Heh. 1/10",
         "Terrible story, poor acting and no humour at all (apart from the final joke at the end) Some sort of ugly angel is sent to earth to save a boy and his mum from being thrown out of their home. Supposed to be a kiddies movie, but even they will not be amused by this terrible film",
         "I don't care how cheesy this is, or how bad the special-effects are. This rules. I'm 19 years old and I love it. I mean, PG movies like this are few and far between. And even though Trenton Knight acts the same in all of his movies, he puts a little bit of spirit into it. Oh, and Jim Wynorski. Now he usually does the \"babes, boobs, and belly laughs\" formula, but this time that's left out. Don't worry, Munchie's goofy dialogue will make up for that. The baseball and Death Race 2000 sequences are best, but the ending is only fair. If you skip this goodie, you don't know what you're missing...",
         "I saw this movie, and at times, I was unnerved believing this movie 'saw me.' Munchie sullies the 'farce' for years to come. Re-watch Star Wars, Don't-watch Munchie. As a responsible parent (I'm speaking to those who are parents now), I (you) would not let my (your) child ever partake of this video festival of the pseudo-occult. To insinuate Munchie is satanic, to a co-viewer, is likely to illicit a chilled 'duh.' He is fiendish, alien, rodential, and wholly malevolent - like the Bogey man made flesh, invisible to adults, tempting children with lifestyles they could never afford (without the income made possible by years of self denial and prudent stewardship). He is a peddler of easy answers, and false ideals. He is everything the morally conscious viewer is not. He is the devil's own Ron Popeil. I pray (I mean this literally and figuratively, with an emphasis on the former) that this movie has not made the format jump to DVD. It is my hope that this type of 'yellow film making' died an un-mourned death in the cold nights of 1994. Munchie also loves pizza. I forgot to mention that. It comes up a lot.",
         "I would like to start off by saying that I don't believe that most adults would enjoy this film and is also the reason why you see that the majority of the people who rate it here have gave it a bad rating. It is simple, this is a movie that only a kid or a kid at heart would enjoy. Now the movie came out before I was born and so I almost didn't get a chance to see it at all and then I caught it along with the first one which was actually even better on TV when I was around 10 or 11 years old. I have seen them both a couple times since and only recently watched them both again for the first time in a couple years. Even now at 15 years old I still find the films magical. I don't know why but it kind of reminds me of being a little kid still and I find that a good feeling to have. So I recommend to anyone young or young at heart to check both of these movies out."
