         "Okay, first off, stay away from the R1 DVD. It's cut/censored to the point where some scenes don't even make sense. This movie started with an interesting premise and did a pretty good job with it. It's not a typical monster/slasher and has a little bit of a psychological lean to it. It's got a mix of you and old actors so the acting tends to be pretty good especially from Ann Turkel and Vince Edwards. Even the ending was a little different from your typical hack and slash. And if you watch the VHS or R2 version you get a smattering of gore and nudity. On the other hand it was a little like the Melrose Place of horror movies, everyone was hitting on everyone and I don't think one character had any fidelity to their current relationships. It didn't succeed 100% but if you want to see something a little different horror-wise you could do worse. If you're looking for action (it drags in spots) and gore, then skip this. If you like to check out different kinds of horror movies, can get in to somewhat psychological films, and don't require stuff that's all formula this might do for a rental. Just don't set your hopes too high.",
         "I wasn't really expecting much from this low budget horror movie, especially considering how cheap it is to buy and the numerous negative comments on IMDb about it, but in all honesty I was pleasantly surprised by �The Fear'. Richard (Eddie Bowz), a psychology student, decides to conduct a group experiment in controlled fear for the purposes of his thesis. After this idea is approved by Dr. Arnold (one of two brief appearances from Wes Craven) he organises a weekend away with his `subjects' at his childhood home. Richard is haunted by nightmares which go back to his childhood, but he is unable to think of what it is that bothers him so much�.and what does this wooden mannequin named Morty have to do with his fears? The first half of this movie is almost like a psychological thriller with a few unnerving parts and some eerie sequences but mainly concentrating on introducing us to the characters. Throughout the first half of movie the viewer learns more about each character as the story progresses but we are also treated to some rather interesting and occasionally dramatic moments. The second half of the film is more like a straight horror film and unfortunately loses some of its appeal due to some rather confusing sequences and unexplained happenings. The acting was fairly good from all the cast, particularly from Heather Medway who played Ashley and Darin Heames who played Troy. Heames previously played Z-Boy in �Night of the Demons 2' and for those who have seen that movie his character was very similar in �The Fear'. Also worthy of comment was the direction from Vince Robert which was of fairly good quality and created a certain dark atmosphere to the movie. It's probably not everyone's cup of tea and the ending left a lot to be desired, including the answers to many important questions but �The Fear' is still fairly entertaining in my opinion. There is a distinct lack of action and no real gore to speak of which is why I consider this a fairly adept thriller. My rating for �The Fear' � 6.5/10",
         "A group of college students go on a field trip to help out a fellow student do his psychology major. He studies fear, and it's effect on people. After going to his childhood home/cabin in the woods, he discovers his old \"childhood friend\" Morty- an old wooden dummy. He uses the dummy in his sessions for his friends to tell their fears to. Twist is, this dummy is alive, and soon kills everyone off using their fears. I actually enjoyed this film. I first saw it about 8 years ago- after buying it for $10 on video. The first thing I noticed about the film was yes, it is cheesy as hell, but the story and acting made it worth watching. It's one of the better acted B-Grade horror/thriller films out there. It cameos Wes Craven as the professor allowing the whole \"field trip\". I particularly liked the soundtrack to the film. Each song is about fears and death. Esham's title track (The Fear (Morty's Theme)) is a great song. I recommend this film to anyone who likes a good night in with a campy horror flick or two. 7/10 Recently picking up this film on DVD I was disappointed to find the film HEAVILY cut. All the profanity has been cut out, and it looks/sounds terrible. AVOID THE FILM ON DVD.",
         "Didn't/couldn't stay tuned throughout but kept flipping back to see if it would continue to make the same lack of sense as previous scenes. If nothing else, it's consistent. A woman is raped, does anyone think of taking her to a hospital? No, the house should do. A guy is missing when they discover the rape victim and he pulls a gun. Does anyone think to find a way to contact the police? No, they all just go back to the house because that's where he probably went. And then there's the guy in dreds who hits on every women in the house, pretends to be sensitive until they reject him, and wigs (no pun intended). In a word, yuck.",
         "Nice try�but that's about the only positive thing you can say about this lackluster attempt to blend psychological thriller with eerie horror monsters. The script desperately tries to be intelligent and innovating but the result is a very poor and tedious movie, even for the already low 90's standards. The story handles about an overly ambitious psychology student who motivates a clique of people to go on a mountain-weekend where he'll finish his thesis about phobias. The point is that all the participants get over their fears by talking about them and, in the meantime, our college boy can process his own childhood trauma. Upon arrival, everyone's fear comes to life in the shape of a life-size wooden dummy. Of course the puppet means trouble! It's made by Indians�it's always the Indians with their spiritual evils, I tell you!! This movie takes itself way too seriously and the makers actually seem to believe that the subject matter is deep and complex! It's not! It's more than obvious that every character hides one of several dark secrets and the viewer figures them all out long before they reveal the \"truth\" themselves. I've rarely seen a movie so predictable than \"The Fear\". The story gets more and more annoying near the end and, the more clever it tries to be, the more ridiculous it all looks. The wooden \"evil personified\" dummy isn't very impressive and the squeaky stretching-sounds he constantly makes aren't my idea of eerie sound effects. Pinocchio actually was a lot scarier�at least he could do tricks with his nose. The acting performances are forgettable, even though I'm sure the guy who came up with the idea to offer Wes Craven a small role is very proud of himself. In case you're looking for some really unsettling evil-dummy horror movies, check out \"Pin\" (brilliant but disgracefully underrated 80's thriller) and \"Magic\" (staring a young Anthony Hopkins\".",
         "I liked \"The Fear\", but not that much. It seemed to waste the few elements it had that might have made it a better film. It does not deliver many chills, and the opportunities it has slip by in what ultimately comes across as a poorly thought out and chaotic film. I found the best moments took place in Uncle Pete's Christmas Village. This sequence showcases some of the movies only eerie scenes, turning familiar Christmas elements into a strangely spooky backdrop. Nevertheless, one feels that Vincent Robert (making a directorial debut), allows too many chances to develop his story slip away. He fails to make use of the generally interesting masks and tree carvings that plague Richard's (Eddie Bowz) dreams as anything more than dream fluffery. The legend of Black Peter, another interesting idea, also fails to get more attention. One may surmise that this motif somehow has entered Richard's subconscious (thus explaining the similarities between Black Peter's face and those of the masks in Richard's dreams). Instead, the director moves along ploddingly, showcasing characters stumbling along forced conflicts which feel contrived. When Ashley (Heather Medway) decides to call off her engagement to Richard because he tries to help Tanya (Anna Karin) the audience gets left wondering what they missed. Most of the character interactions feel this artificial. Watch this movie as part of horror marathon, or at the very least, with its sequel `The Fear: Halloween Night', but do not expect too much from it.",
         "I popped this DVD into my player with no expectations. I just wanted to see a good horror B movie. The creepy picture of \"Morty\" (the thoroughly menacing wooden monster on the front cover of the DVD box) made me think this movie could deliver the goods. I thought it was an interesting premise. I love horror movies where inanimate objects come to life and kill! Kill! KILL!! I love brutal death scenes. I love evil, sickening monsters that commit unspeakable acts on the human form, and I love movies that have the guts (no pun intended!) to show it all in gruesome gory detail. Despite the interesting premise, the film completely fails to deliver the goods! First, the characters are absolutely horribly written and completely unlikeable. The actors didn't do that bad of a job, its just the way all these cliched characters were written that makes me not give anything resembling a damn about them. All the cliches are here: the whiny bitch, the new-ager who predicts beforehand that something weird/supernatural is happening, the dirty psycho/sleazebag, and the token black guy (first to get killed of course!). Not helping is this white guy with dreadlocks. I guess he supposed to be comic relief, but he fails so, so badly. Second, The action is virtually non-existent. Not a one cool death in the whole lame film. No blood, no gore, no nudity, no one-liners, none of the things that make B horror movies fun to watch. Not to mention, the movie is so dark, its nearly impossible too see the pathetic action sequences when they do occur. Morty looks scary but acts stupid and moves like a retarded zombie. FINAL RATING: 3/10 Bad pacing makes this wholly unscary, and complete lack of violence and nudity make it wholly uncool. Movie takes itself way too seriously! It tires to be deep but comes off boring. Only minimal skill was evident. Not even a decent B horror genre flick...and come on, thats not asking much! Noob Aalox",
         "The Fear (1995) was a total snooze fest. I saw this movie several years ago on cable t.v. For the life of me I had no idea why I even bother watching the entire movie. I never thought I would experience such a lame horror film (that was until I watched a couple of Asylum productions). The only saving grace was the attractive mail order bride from Europe that guest star Vince Edwards shared screen time with. The story (if you want to know or bothering even caring about) has something to do with a wooden statue and a psycho killer. Horror hack Wes Craven makes a cameo appearance as a doctor. Put this bad boy in your D.V.D. player. Is it so lame and offensive that'll make you want to smash your t.v. set? No, it's lame in the sense that it'll put you to sleep in no time. Just wait until the European woman makes an appearance, then you'll have something to think about when you nod off. I would have to pass on this movie and run away from it the next time I see it on the video store shelf or on t.v. Not at all recommended.",
         "Granted, I've seen better horror flicks in my day, but this is a solid outing. Morty, the life-sized wooden doll, redefines creepy. Throw him in a dark wooden setting, and you get some solid terror. The plot centers around a student Richard, well played by Eddie Bowz, who invites some friends to a wooden cabin to analyze their fears as study for his thesis papers. While there, Richard must confront his own inner demons which become magnified when he sees his childhood toy Morty at the cabin. Soon Morty begins to terrorize the group, using their darkest fears as a weapon. The cast was solid. Bowz handles the lead quite well and genre oddball Darin Heames(Night of the Demons 2 & Dr. Giggles) shines as his best pal with questionable morals. Heather Medway, portraying Bowz' love interest was the best actress involved, outshining Ann Turkel. I recommend this for people who like to be creeped out. Has a dark atmosphere and the use of the foley artists as Morty chases people was handled well also.",
         "***Three Out of Ten Stars*** A serial killer possesses a Native American wooden statue named Morty, because the serial killer committed suicide and just cant rest! The serial killer's son convinces a bunch of his friends to spend Halloween at his grandparent's estate in the country. Their plan is to complete a ritual on Halloween night that will bring Morty, the wooden statue, to life. All of this to bring peace to the serial killer! It seems the serial killer's son instigated this activity, perhaps because he's a psycho himself? All we do know for sure is that these friends are unaware that the statue is possessed by a serial killer's spirit. What this all has to do with Halloween, I don't know. And that's why I rented the film, because I thought it had something to do with Halloween. The only thing this film has to do with Halloween is that there are some lighted pumpkins in the background, and that the events supposedly take place on Halloween night. That's one of the biggest disappointments here, the film tickets itself as a Halloween scare, but there's no feeling of Halloween whatsoever. The filmmakers clearly tacked their crappy plot onto Halloween to trick people into seeing this debacle. Wow! That's all I can say, is wow! This film is a complete disaster... I gave it every chance but it failed on every level. The only slightly redeeming quality of this film is the cinematography: There is nothing lazy about the cinematography; the shots progress rapidly and are probably the only thing that kept me from falling asleep. Besides rapid shot cuts, there's nothing redeeming in regards to the acting, directing, or plot. The sound and lighting are sufficient, but nothing to write home about. It's really frustrating, because it seems as if the filmmakers had the financial means to produce a somewhat respectable film. The basic idea of a mystical figure stalking and killing people based on their inner most fears is a great idea. Unfortunately, the filmmakers delve into ridiculous relationship sequences and obnoxious youth group gatherings that have no impact on the core story. The serial killer's son's friends have no personalities and are extremely unlikeable. Let me also mention Mitch, the douche bag boyfriend with an obviously fake English accent and the resident Native American who acts as the guardian for the wooden statue Morty for some unbeknownst reason. I could go on and on with the negatives of this film, but why? It's simply horrid. I really don't know what the bottom line plot of this film is? The jump scares don't work. There's no gore. There's NO nudity. There's no graphic violence. What the hell is the point of this film? The climax is non-existent. Morty is supposed to be made of wood but looks like some ham actor in a rubber jump suit. It's really just one asinine film making error after another. Just stay away!"
