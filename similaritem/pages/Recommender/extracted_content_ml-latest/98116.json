         "This is typical Hollywood me too products. The first Scorpion King is okay. The second Scorpion King was worse than the first one but still enjoyable. And if that is any indication, then you would expect that the 3rd series would be watchable. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The story-line is quite confusing. If the first and the second part was in some Middle East related country, this one is not very clear. It start with some sort of Middle East scenery, then you have building which definitely look like the one you find in Thailand and the inhabitant have all the Eastern look-like feature. Of course you have to have the Thai-box action and to make more confusing...... a ninja.... The only thing you can enjoy on this movie is if you like muscular men parading their half naked body in the tattered clothing and strangely enough this big men are very easy to knock out. A little slap from a woman will render them unconscious... Anyway, don't waste you money or time on this one. I did and I regret that nobody was giving me a warning.....",
         "It was like a test: can the third part of a franchise that spawned out of another franchise that wasn't that good be any good? Can Ron Perlman and Billy Zane save it? And the test was failed miserably. Let me explain this to you in a way that anyone can understand: if you watch this on fast forward x4, it will be a total waste of your time. At least Ron Perlman has a small role appearing at the beginning and the end of the film. Billy Zane does his usual evil smiling villain, but it is not enough. And the \"Scorpion King\", not only does he not act like one, he actually plays the entire movie as a positive hero with no baggage. The only connection remains the \"deep voiced\" words of the narrator who pretty much says: \"this is the Scorpion King! Really!\" and then disappears. And the actor... is Victor Webster! He played in Mutant X, for crying out loud, and looks like an underwear model. Bottom line: avoid this film at all costs. Or watch it at x8, maybe it works then.",
         "After seeing the Mummy films, from which i loved, i was excited at the first Scorpion King film to show show his story. Then they had a sequel showing the upbringing of the SK, which had mixed reviews, but was watchable. This had me thinking - they should've left it at that. Watching this new sequel to the scorpion king films, I wouldn't recommend to anyone. The acting is appalling, the fighting was very poor. Their attempt at keeping the storyline entertaining failed miserably, you would think an Arcadian would be able to fight. The main character Mathayus, was played by a non action star in an action film - don't make sense. Avoid at all costs!!",
         "First of all I want to simply warn the movie watchers regarding the opinion I am going to express. Personally I feel that this is the worst Movie I have viewed during my existence. The movie starts with a narrative to catch the viewers interest and attention. I was under the impression that it would be a good movie, after 30 minutes of watching this movie I simply had get out of the and not look back. I have never have degraded anyones work, with the exception of this film. I wish I could comprehend what the writer and producer were thinking when they chose the acting crew. The only actor that I notice talent was from Victor Webster, the hero, the king with out a kingdom. I cannot even continue to write about this movie since its a waste of time and money. I would not watch this movie even If I was paid and given free popcorn.",
         "I fell asleep attempting to watch the first time around and decided, against my better judgment that I should finish watching it before I wrote a review. what a mistake. The movie cant make up it's mind if it is Roman, Greek, barbarian, Chinese or Indian which made me think that due to a low budget they just raided the a warehouse of leftover props from better movies. Words cannot explain how bad the dialog was: a constant series or awful one-liners that actually left me feeling slightly sick. Not to mention some of the worst acting I've ever seen. It's difficult to think of a man, with prettier hair than most girls I know, being a mighty warrior, and to be honest he's really not that impressive in the movie... His fat barbarian friend outshines him in most fights... sigh I would strongly recommend you do not waste your time on this movie, because, no matter how low you standards, you will wont enjoy it.",
         "It's very unfortunate that a movie with such a star studded cast should be made with such a low budget. The sets are weak! The lack of people on the sets is deplorable. The \"Kingdom\" seems more like a village with some excuse of an army. The use of CGi is very evident in many scenes and makes the whole set look very cheap and tacky. The \"Great\" Scorpion King keeps getting hammered in almost all the fights! None of the \"glory\" or the fact that he's a \"great\" warrior come's through. Story line has none of the punch or substance like the previous installments of the movie! The story ends with a whimper and not with a bang as the movie would like to portray! So sad! Total Dis-appointment!",
         "This movie has some terrible acting by Victor Webster and they try to add humor which ends up being very dry. After 10 minutes watching you feel like just turning it off. I gave it a chance and watch the entire movie. A complete waste of time watching this movie. Before watching this movie look and see if anyone has one good thing to say about this movie. Its the worse movie I have seen in a long time that I'm glad I did not purchase this movie. Its not even worth being placed on the $5 clearance shelf at any store. be warned this movie is not worth watching at all!! Wasn't one time where anything good or decent happened and you will just be searching the entire movie for something to validate watching the movie. movie for the trash bin for sure.",
         "Please do not go into this movie thinking it is going to be anything like Scorpion King or Scorpion King 2. The first one was great, the second one was good, but this one is a total waste of time. It is nothing like the first two since this \"king\" is now a hired assassin and no longer a king. The dialog is terrible, the fight scenes unrealistic, the acting seemed like they were reading off cue cards, there was no emotion at all. The story may have had something to do with it since there was very little plot to follow. Just random fight scenes, and the 6'5\" 300 lb king got beat up by a 5' tall 90 lb woman in one of them. I don't know what happened to Billy Zane, but he lost whatever acting skills he had (which were minimal to begin with). He was flat out horrible. Truly, honestly, and sincerely-do not waste your time on this just because you may think it is a continuation of the Scorpion series. It is not and it stinks",
         "With each sequel to Scorpion King the movie gets worse and worse. I'm not sure if it's because of the shrinking budget, but there's definitely something wrong with this. The script was just plain and cliché, like you can see in any exotic movie or video game of this type (like Prince of Persia) or all the previous Scorpion Kings. Other than this the film offers a lot of muscle and skin without any noticeable acting and handpicked women from Asia and some men from W.W.E. Championship to spice it up a little bit. Of course there are also some jokes which could make a 5th-grade-kid smile. Directing becomes rather trivial behind all these so I'm skipping it. So if you're looking for something to kill your time go ahead, but if you're in it for the art or cinematography this is not for you, keep away.",
         "OK, this is not Conan and it's not 'really' Scorpion King in anything but name. But having said that, I think other reviewers are being too harsh. I found this movie to be an enjoyable evening's diversion. The action sequences are fun to watch, the acting is decent (if a bit hammy in places), and the story line is pretty good. The settings are richly decorated and the battle scenes look fairly well done. In other words, nothing spectacular here, but certainly not lacking some charm. Billy Zane is evil fun as always, with the glare and voice that exude malevolence. Victor Webster does a decent job as Mathayus, giving him a good blend of humor and sad weariness. Bostin Christopher started off as a bit too buffoonish as Olaf, but grew on me as the movie progressed. And Krystal Vee is a delight as Silda, a role she fills with surprising depth. The film has enough action and plot twists to keep you entertained, just don't be looking for high cinema."
