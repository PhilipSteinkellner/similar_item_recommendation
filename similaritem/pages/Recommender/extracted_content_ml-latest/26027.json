         "content": "Tension and Terror in the Skies!\r\n\r\nFamously parodied as Airplane in 1980, it gets forgotten just what a rollicking good thriller Zero Hour! is. Dana Andrews is the airman scarred by an incident during the war who has to battle his demons when the crew and passengers of the jumbo jet he is aboard fall victim to food poisoning. Sterling Hayden is down on the ground smoking loads of ciggies and having no faith in trying to talk Andrews down safely.\r\n\r\nOne of the first disaster aeroplane movies, it follows what we now regard as the staples of the genre. Troubled protagonist, family strife, calm characters, panic characters, lovely ladies, square jawed men, raging weather conditions and an aeroplane in serious danger of plummeting from the sky and killing all on board. It's sometimes hokey and one dimensional in terms of plot developments, but it commits to the drama and grinds out a suspenseful last half hour that can have you edging towards the edge of your seat.\r\n\r\nA must see for fans of such fare. It's ok to love Airplane! and prefer its comedy smartness, but it's also ok to doff a respectful pilot cap towards Zero Hour! as well. 7.5/10",

      "synopsis": "In 2010 Zero Hour is as funny as Airplane, only it wasn't meant to be at the time. Kudos to TCM for showing it immediately following Airplane. Great to see Dana Andrews when young, and planes had cockpits you could just walk into. If you're a fan of Airplane, or post-war movies, this is a must see. ===================================================== We open with a long shot of an airfield and a squadron of British Spitfire fighters taking off. Credits and title follow. A narrator tells us, \"On April 10, 1945 units of the 72nd Squadron of the Royal Air Force crossed the boundary of Germany under the command of Canadian squadron leader Ted Stryker. Their mission: Penetrate enemy fighter cover and hold the formation intact for a vital incendiary raid on the German supply depots of Wiesbaden. At 0730, 12 miles from the target, enemy fighters were sighted directly ahead. Stryker led his planes to meet them.\" An aerial dogfight ensues. Caught in fog, six of Stryker's men crashed into the German countryside. Five weeks later the war in Europe was over. Stryker (Dana Andrews) recovers in the Edinburgh Military Hospital, he has a head wound and a severe case of what is known today as PTSD. He is examined by a British Army Doctor (Willis Bouchey). Stryker blames himself for the deaths of his six comrades. The doctor suggests he face up to his decision and the consequences. CANADA 1956. Eleven years later at the Mid-Canadian Aircraft Co., Ltd. Jet Research, Winnipeg Division, Ted Stryker is talking to Frank Graham (Roy Gordon) about a job. Graham is reluctant to hire someone who has had 12 jobs in 10 years. He notes, \"And not one of them shows you can accept any responsibility.\" Stryker confides that his marriage is on the rocks and he needs the job badly. Graham tells him he'll see what he can do. Feeling confident, Stryker brings home a bottle of champagne to celebrate with his wife, Helen (Linda Darnell). Ted searches the house but his wife is out. He finds a note on the counter. He crumples it up. He rushes to the airport only to find his wife boarding a DC-4 airplane. Aboard with Ellen is their son, Joey (Ray Farrell). Ted hastily buys a ticket and boards. The plane takes off in the dark. Ted has a death grip on the seat. He gets up and goes to the restroom. Looking out the window causes a flashback to the mission over Germany. Ted recovers, talks to the pilot, Capt. Bill Wilson (Elroy \"Crazylegs\" Hirsch), and then walks up the aisle to see his wife and son. Stewardess, Janet Turner (Peggy King) talks to one of the passengers. In fact they know each other. Tony Decker (Jerry Paris) apologizes to Janet for having to break a date at the last minute. Ted asks Janet if he can arrange a cockpit visit for his son, Joey. This will give Ted and Ellen a chance to talk. In the cockpit, the copilot, Walt Stewart (Steve London) reminds the captain that the temperature is going up on Engine #3. Janet, Ted and Joey enter the cockpit. Janet informs the captain that she'll be serving dinner soon--the choice is grilled halibut or lamb chops. Both pilots request the fish. Joey asks for fish and his father Ted requests the lamb. Capt. Wilson calls for a weather report and is told, \"Looks like snow and ice crystals around Regina.\" Most likely some fog in an hour or two for Calgary. Ted returns to Joey's seat to talk to Ellen. Ellen reminds Ted of eleven years of different cities, different jobs and the change in his personality. She concludes, \"I can't live with a man I don't respect. Joey leaves the cockpit as Janet brings the copilot his dinner. Janet starts to pick up the meal trays from those passengers who have finished their dinner. Joey takes his dad's seat and is amused by Janet's boyfriend, Tony Decker. He puts a sock puppet on his hand and amuses Joey. Janet brings Joey his dinner. A woman passenger (Maxine Cooper) complains, \"My stomach. I never felt anything like it before. Help me. Please help me.\" Janet calls Capt. Wilson to report a sick passenger. The pilot suggests Janet quietly find a doctor on board. The copilot is now feeling queasy and sweating. Janet finds a doctor, Dr. Baird (Geoffrey Toone) and asks him to see one of the passengers. Ted approaches Janet and Dr. Baird and tells them his son is also sick. The doctor examines the sick woman passenger. Baird tells Janet, \"You better tell the captain. We've got to land. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.\" Next the doctor examines Joey and asks Ellen what he's eaten in the last 24 hours. The doctor speaks to the captain about landing. The plane goes into a steep dive and the captain returns to the cockpit. He finds the copilot slumped over the controls. The doctor removes the copilot from his seat as the captain resumes the controls. The doctor concludes the common denominator is food. Janet tells the doctor that both Joey and the copilot had fish. Another passenger (John Zaremba) tells Janet his wife is sick. She asks if she had fish or lamb for dinner. He tells her, \"We both had fish, why?\" The captain tells the doctor, \"I just remembered something. I ate fish too.\" The captain declares an emergency with air traffic control and asks for priority into Vancouver. The doctor gives the captain a shot of morphine. The ground controllers discuss the options available. Just as everything seems ok, Capt. Wilson gets sick. He sets the automatic pilot then collapses. The doctor asks Janet, \"Is there anybody else on board who can land this plane and who didn't have fish for dinner?\" He proposes a ruse of asking if someone can help with the radio. Janet asks Ted. He goes up to the cockpit, sees the doctor, and then sees no one is flying the plane. The doctor asks, \"Can you fly this airplane and land it?\" Ted replies, \"No, not a chance.\" The doctor makes it clear. Every passenger who is sick may die unless Ted can fly and land the airplane. They have about two hours. Ted reluctantly takes the controls. Ellen joins Ted in the cockpit. The doctor gives it to her straight. Both pilots are sick and Ted is their only hope. Ellen is recruited as co-pilot. Her job will be to handle the radio and talk to the ground controllers, leaving Ted free to fly the airplane. Ted calls Mayday and ground controllers clear the airspace around them. Ted informs the controllers that he's only flown a single engine fighter during the war, and hasn't been in an airplane for 10 years. Vancouver air traffic controllers make arrangements to get Capt. Treleaven. He flew with Stryker during the war and knows him inside out. Ted tells Ellen to take over the radio. They try to reach Treleaven at home but are told he and his wife are at a nightclub. They reach him there and tell him to come to the airport at once. Treleaven arrives at the airport and talks to Harry Burdick (Charles Quinlivan). He tells Burdick that he and Stryker have a history and perhaps someone else should talk to Stryker. The radio dispatcher in Vancouver (Larry Thor) informs Burdick reception is good with Flight 714 and they can take over. Treleaven calls Ted and introduces himself. It is obvious they dislike each other. Ted unlocks the auto pilot to get the feel of the airplane. He practices a few shallow turns. When asked about the weather, Ellen tells the ground, \"Rain and a little ice.\" Ted climbs to 11,000 feet. They are now about the clouds and bad weather. A hysterical woman passenger panics (Fintan Meyler) and must be calmed. Ted practices slower airspeed at 120 knots, 20 degrees of flaps and landing gear down. The lightning triggers his PTSD and he flashes back to the failed mission. Only his wife telling him his airspeed is off returns him to concentrate on flying. Ted recovers the airplane, but a startled passenger opens the cockpit door and discovers Ted flying the plane. \"Look, he isn't a pilot,\" the startled man shouts. The doctor comes clean with the passengers. Unfortunately Ted descended too low near the mountains, and the radio reception is lost. Repeated calls to the ground go unanswered. Ted adjusts the frequency to regain contact. Vancouver controllers contact Capt. Wilson's wife, Joan (Patricia Tiernan, credited as Carole Eden) and tell her to get to the airport. Radar finally picks up Flight 714 and he changes course to the airport. Ted begins a slow descent, but the weather is getting worse at Vancouver. A local newspaper prepares two headlines for the next day's edition, \"Airline Disaster Here\" and \"38 Airline Passengers Survive Mid-Air Peril.\" Ellen goes back to see Joey and Dr. Baird goes up to see Ted. Bad news, the fog's getting thicker at Vancouver and Ted is about 30 miles out at 2500 feet altitude. Treleaven and Burdick head for the tower for Ted's final approach and landing. Joan arrives in the tower to be briefed on her husband's flight and his condition. At 1000 feet and nearing the airport Ted again experiences flashbacks. Ted decides to land now, rather than circle and wait for the weather to get better. Ellen tells him, \"Ted, I just wanted you to know now...I'm very proud.\" Emergency equipment is on the field and waiting. Ted finally sees the approach and runway lights. The passengers brace for impact. Ted is coming in too fast. He touches down and jumps on the brakes and cuts the engines. The airplane slides to one side and the landing gear snap off. The DC-4 slides to a stop and emergency equipment rushes to the scene. Treleaven calls Ted and tells him, \"Ted, that was probably the lousiest landing in the history of this airport. But there are some of us here, particularly me that would like to buy you a drink and shake your hand.\" Ted and Ellen exit the cockpit. We close with a closeup of a headset draped over the control yoke. [Note: the 1980 movie Airplane! is a spoof of this movie. Huge sections of dialog are lifted verbatim.]",

         "Oh. My. Gawd. TCM had a ZAZ-fest recently, with THE NAKED GUN, TOP SECRET, AIRPLANE!, and...a certain movie that I've never come across before. ZERO HOUR! is the first time I've watched a movie I've never seen before but could quote the dialogue along with. Examples: \"Sluggish, like a wet sponge.\" \"I just want to say 'good luck'.\" \"You're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?\" \"Flying a plane is no different than riding a bicycle.\" \"You ever been in a cockpit before?\" \"No sir, I've never been up in a plane before!\" \"The survival of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone on board who can not only fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.\" Sound familiar? In addition to the verbatim dialogue (and the exclamation point in its title), AIRPLANE! contained many other similarities. The co-pilot played by a former Los Angeles pro-ball player. The female passenger in hysterics. Little Joey visiting the cockpit (where the pilot puts his arm around him with perhaps inappropriate affection before giving him a toy plane). The unmarried stewardess. A wife awakened in the middle of the night by a phone call telling her to come to the airport immediately. Ted Stryker flashing back to the war and recovering in a veterans' hospital. Newspaper headlines prognosticating disaster. Inclement weather. The plane landing while losing its wheels. I could go on, but, really, the only things missing were a jive-talking black duo and a crucial moment in which the heroine's bobby pin saves the day. ZERO HOUR! was of course never intended to provoke laughs, but how can anyone watch this story now with a straight face? Try watching an old Leslie Nielsen drama without cracking up. It was actually a delight learning where the ZAZ boys got a lot of their material (and AMC occasionally runs AIRPORT 1975, which is where, if I remember correctly, the nun, sick little girl and singing stewardess originated). If TCM ever runs ZERO HOUR! again, I implore every fan of AIRPLANE! to sit down for eighty minutes and watch it. It's an eye-popping experience, in a whole new way.",
         "I was always told that Airplane! was a take off of the Airport movies of the 70s. It might have been, but the main source for the film was Zero Hour! This film is hilarious if you're a big Airplane! fan. As I watched ZH, I was reciting the same Airplane! dialogue in my head. I've never seen two movies that are so similar. It's quite a hoot!",
         "And you thought the dialogue and acting went over the top in \"Airplane,\" huh? Thank you TCM for running this the other day. I had never seen it before, but wait a minute, sure I had... dozens of times. That's what made the ZH viewing such a hoot. ZAZ did such a fine job colorizing \"Zero Hour!\" I had the whole script memorized. If you have grown slightly weary from repeated \"Airplane\" yukfests, find a copy of its propellorized progenitor and enjoy the comedy anew. So true is the original to its parody (note the deliberate juxtaposition) I half expected Geoffrey Toone's (Dr. Baird) nose to grow as he attempted to calm the passengers. All that was missing was June Cleaver's \"Jive Talkin'!\"",
         "_Airplane!_ was so closely based on this movie that the list of DIFFERENCES between this movie and _Airplane!_ is shorter than the list of similarities. Some of the differences between _Zero Hour!_ and _Airplane!_ are: *) The only two characters with the same names are Ted Striker and Joey. *) In ZH, Ted Striker's ill-fated air raid during the War was dramatized in its entirety at the beginning of the movie, not reconstructed piecemeal in flashbacks over the course of the film -- although Ted did have a couple of flashbacks in ZH at crucial moments. *) The flight in ZH is a DC-4 carrying 38 passengers from Calgary to Vancouver, BC. The airspeed indicator for the DC-4 only went up to 250 miles per hour. *) In ZH, Ellen (the character that became Elaine in _Airplane!_) was Ted Striker's wife, and Joey was his son. Joey was among the unlucky passengers who ate fish (halibut) instead of meat (lamb chops), and he gets so sick that he symbolically breaks the toy airplane the pilot had given him. *) The pilot in ZH succumbs to food poisoning slowly, and manages to keep the plane under control for an hour or so, thanks to a morphine injection administered by the Doctor, until he finally collapses. The automatic pilot (not inflatable, of course) was already engaged by then. *) Nothing like the Knute-Rockne-based inspirational speech that the Doctor gave to Ted Striker in _Airplane!_ is anywhere to be found in ZH. *) In ZH, the unmarried stewardess had a boyfriend on board who tried to cheer up Joey with a glove-puppet. *) A tense moment happens in ZH where the plane's radio accidentally gets knocked off the proper frequency and Ted Striker is on his own, cut off from communication with the ground, until Ted and Mrs. Striker can find the frequency again. This sequence does not appear in _Airplane!_. *) In ZH, when the air traffic controllers went looking for Ted Striker's old commanding Captain, they first had to call his babysitter at home (who had Elvis Presley turned up way too loud on the TV to hear them), and then had to call a nightclub where said Captain and his wife were dancing to an equally-loud jazz band.",
         "This is an exciting film which is well acted and directed with all the tension needed to keep you sitting bolt upright throughout the climactic finale. Perhaps the rushed narrated intro is just a little too over-dramatic but it does not detract from the quality of the rest of the film. I am well aware of the film's relation to \"Airplane!\" (which is hilarious) and some moments are impossible to watch without one being reminded of their parody versions (the reference to quitting smoking especially). Nevertheless, it still works as an exciting piece of cinema.",
         "Ignore reader comments that say that the movie \"Airplane!\" by Abrahams, Zucker and Zucker is a \"rip-off\" of \"Zero Hour.\" Airplane was a SPOOF of Zero Hour - not a rip-off. One would think \"Airplane!\" was a spoof on \"Airport\" - and in a way it was, but watch \"Zero Hour\" and you'll see their real inspiration. If watch Airplane first, then Zero Hour, you'll find Zero Hour to be a very (unintentionally) funny COMEDY! The AIRPLANE writers even pulled one ridiculous line from Zero Hour, untouched: \"The life of everybody on board depends on one thing. Finding somebody on board who not only can fly the plane, but didn't have fish for dinner.\"",
         "Tense drama with Dana Andrews who never forgot his unfortunate incident with a plane at the end of World War 11 is Wiesbaden, Germany. Fast forward to 10 years later as Ted Stryker, Andrews, is unable to keep a job and his wife, the love Linda Darnell leaves him with her young son. He catches them on the plane only to find an in air situation where he must take over the plane when the 2 pilots fall ill due to eating fish. Other passengers fall ill as well. Enter Sterling Hayden, who was with Andrews during the war, who will now help guide him down. Hayden is terrific as the chain smoking pilot, who could make anyone nervous by how he delivers his instructions to Andrews and Darnell, who handles the radio. This is gripping drama at its best.",
         "It's like déjà vu all over again. Until last night, I had never seen Zero Hour!, but I feel as if I've seen it a dozen times. I knew that some of Airplane! (the sick girl and singing nun for example) came from Airport, but I had no idea just how much was taken from Zero Hour! Airplane! is like some weird comedic remake or re-imaging of Zero Hour! � and they nailed it right down to the exclamation mark. And it's not just ideas or concepts that were taken from Zero Hour!, entire sections of dialogue were lifted and used in Airplane! I'm shocked to discover that lines like \"I guess I picked the wrong week to give up smoking\" weren't written especially for Airplane! The dialogue is so similar that when little Joey visits the cockpit and the captain asks if he's ever been in cockpit before, I kept waiting for him to ask \"Have you ever seen a grown man naked?\" as he does in Airplane! Even some of the performances in Airplane! are eerily reminiscent of Zero Hour! Take Robert Stack in the role originally done by Sterling Hayden. Amazing stuff! The funny thing to me about this example, however, is that Hayden is actually more intense in the role than Stack could have dreamed. Giving a rating to Zero Hour! is difficult. Even if you've only seen Airplane! once (and I've probably seen it a couple of dozen times over the years), it's all but impossible to keep a straight face (Who am I kidding? It's impossible not to downright laugh out loud.) when Johnny goes to make coffee or when Stryker straights sweating buckets behind the controls of the plane. It's impossible to take the melodrama of Zero Hour! seriously. So I don't know how I would rate the movie had I never seen Airplane! I would like to think I would have still enjoyed the experience and would have formed a similar opinion. But I have seen Airplane!, so I have that built in bias. In the end, because the movie kept me entertained (for whatever reason) throughout it's brief 81 minute runtime, I'm rating Zero Hour! a 7/10.",
         "Arthur Hailey co-scripted this adaptation of his \"story\" (actually his play, the uncredited \"Flight Into Danger\") along with director Hall Bartlett and producer John C. Champion about an airliner crippled mid-flight when the crew and most of the passengers are stricken from bacteria-laced fish. Dana Andrews plays a war-scarred ex-fighter pilot haunted by his record in WWII who is the only person aboard adequately prepared to land the plane; he gets his radio instructions via land from Sterling Hayden, who just happened to be Andrews' wartime adversary! Mediocre in all aspects, but still thoroughly engrossing and enjoyable. The plot and characters should be recognizable to fans of the 1980 satire \"Airplane!\"...however this one is already spoofy as all get-out (though it doesn't mean to be), starting with that grave narration. Linda Darnell's role as Andrews' estranged wife and reluctant co-pilot is a scream (she has no faith in her nervous husband, yet near the finish glows with wifely pride). Andrews and Hayden act it to the hilt, while the dialogue becomes entrenched in a kind of quotable inanity (\"He can't land that plane in this soup!\"). Nothing to take seriously, but fun nevertheless. *** from ****",
         "Air-borne adventure that keeps you on the edge of your seat. A Canadian passenger plane finds itself in trouble. Accidental ptomaine poisoning strikes all passengers that were served baked halibut instead of pork chops. The pilot Captain Bill Wilson(football legend Elroy 'Crazylegs' Hirsch) manages to keep control of the plane a bit longer than his co-pilot. The only one on board with remote ability to land the plane is Lt. Ted Stryker(Dana Andrews), who flew fighter planes in WWII. A problem exists with Stryker; he has never lived down losing fliers during the war and hasn't attempted to fly in ten years. Reluctantly he takes over the plane with his estranged wife(Linda Darnell)as his co-pilot. Other players include: Sterlling Hayden, Geoffrey Toone, Peggy King and Jerry Paris."

         "During WWII, Ted Stryker was an Allied (Canadian) Air Force pilot. During his last mission as a squadron leader in 1945, he feels six of his men died because of a misjudgment on his part. He has not forgiven himself ever since for those deaths. Eleven years later back in Winnipeg, his life has not progressed because of his inability to deal with that tragedy. Just when his professional life seems to be getting back on track, his wife Ellen leaves him, taking their son Joey with her. Despite not having been in a plane since WWII and feeling mentally unprepared to do so, Ted follows Ellen onto a flight to Vancouver. Tragedy strikes aboard the flight when half those on board - including the pilot, co-pilot and Joey - are stricken with food poisoning. It is not only a rush to land the plane quickly in Vancouver to take those sick to hospital (all closer airports being closed due to inclement weather), but also trying to find someone on board not sick to fly the plane. Ted is their only hope. Ted gets some assistance on the mechanics of the newer airplane technology from Captain Martin Treleaven on the ground at air control in Vancouver, Martin who was a flying colleague of Ted's during WWII.

He manages to get on board the aircraft before it leaves but when the pilot and co-pilot - along with many passengers, including his son Joey - fall severely ill due to food poisoning, Stryker is the only man on-board with any flying experience, though not in multi-engine aircraft. He has to overcome his fears if he is to save the life of his loved ones and the rest of the passengers and crew."

If that sounds vaguely familiar, it's because 'Airplane' was a send-up of this forerunner of the 1970s disaster movie. Written by Michael Brooke",
