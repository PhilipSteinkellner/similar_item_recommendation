         "content": "> Not very innovative, as well as not that bad.\r\n\r\nLike the previous year, the 2015 was also considered the year of sci-fi in the film world. Plenty of large and small scale flicks came out and among them I was eagerly waiting for this one. If the story is what you always prefer with a fine production quality, then this film won't disappoint you. The performances were also well supported. Then what was this film's issue?\r\n\r\nThe last time widely accepted movie by Tarsem Singh was when he engaged in the screenplay development. After that he did not see much success where all his directed ones were written by others. My perception is that he must do those both department where he's good at it. Take this film as an example, an awesome story and had a good cast, but the writing was let down according to many who saw it.\r\n\r\nEven in the short period of appearance, Ben Kingsley's role's legacy carried out till the end, because the concept was designed like that way. Being one of the top actors, Ryan Reylands films are not that celebratable. Though he's doing a decent flicks often and those were failing to recognise in the higher level, which did not spare this one as well.\r\n\r\nPeople are comparing it to 'Face/off', but to me it looked more like coming together of 'The Island' and 'Skeleton Key'. Whatever it is I had a good time. Not a fresh concept of an idea, but narrated differently and it needed a bit depth in showcasing everything in the film.\r\n\r\nMy formula/secret for watching a movie successfully even it considered as an average or worse is, I won't bother for all the departments come together to become a well crafted product like the critics expect, because I'm a movie fanatic and love watching them almost most of the time than arguing about its flawed contents. If I find anything solely interesting like acting, music, story, visuals, I respect the efforts. So do I to this one and believe me it is much better than what the critics say so.\r\n\r\n7/10",

      "synopsis": "Business tycoon and billionaire Damian Hale (Ben Kingsley) is master of his own universe, until he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Now on his deathbed, he finds a business card directing him to a man named Professor Albright (Matthew Goode), who informs him about a radical medical procedure called \"shedding\", in which one's consciousness is transferred to an artificially grown healthy body. While Damian searches the article about Dr. Francis Jensen, a shedding neurologist, he suddenly collapses and the blood sputum is spurting onto the laptop. In his nursing home, Damian receives a call from Albright, saying that once he transferred into another body, it will not return to his original body and his death will be made to the public. Also, Albright plans Damian to fly to New Orleans to meet his friend, Martin. Damian then buries the box, containing something, in the cemetery. Damian and Martin having a coffee in the restaurant, but Damian collapse again to the floor. He is now brought into Albrights and he decides to transfer to the healthy body, we call him as Young Damian. Now his body is transferred to the new body, Young Damian begins to learn how to walk, swimming, etc. Albright prescribes medication to ease vivid hallucinations which he claims are side effects of the procedure. Young Damian starts a new life in New Orleans under a pseudonym of Edward Kittner. After Young Damian introduces his new home, he goes to play basketball and befriends his neighbor, Anton. After Young Damian read his own obituaries in the internet, he tries to call his daughter, Claire, but he refuses to talk with her and quickly hangs up the phone. Because he forgot to take his medicine, Young Damian subsequently hallucinate the war, the woman and a child, and the water tower styled as a pumpkin. When Edward asks Albright about the hallucinations, he dismisses his concerns, but accidentally reveals that he knows details of the hallucinations that Edward did not reveal. Albright arranges for him to move to Hawaii for a change of scenery, but Edward, convinced the hallucinations are some kind of memory, researches a landmark he saw in his vision and heads to St. Louis instead. In St. Louis, Young Damian infiltrates a house and sees the picture frames of himself and his wife, Madeline. Young Damian encounters Madeline, who identifies him as her apparently deceased husband Mark. After that, Albrights men, led by Anton - who reveals that he is one of Albright's employees breaks into the house and attacked Young Damian/Mark and Madeline. Edward learns that the body he inhabits belonged to another man who sold himself to Albright in order to gain the money he needed to cure their sick daughter. Young Damian then excuses him to go to the bathroom for taking medicine. After he took medicine, Young Damian attacks the henchman and kills him. Young Damian sees the fire thrower burns Madelines car. Anton and his henchman overhear the crashing and go to the bathroom. Young Damian shoots another man and Anton told him to the front. Anton goes inside the bathroom then tries to subdue each other, loses the medicine in the process. Young Damian tackles Anton out of the house and he goes back inside the house. The fire thrower burns the house. Young Damian takes Madeline out, but before they can escape, the two goes down under the house. Unseen by Anton and his other men, Young Damian shoots the fire thrower, accidentally burns Anton alive but manage to kill the fire by soaking himself into the tub and kills the henchman. The two escape and collect her daughter, Anna, from school. The two stay at a motel for a while before heading to New Orleans. There, Young Damian researches the internet of Dr. Jensen, the man who invented shedding; Mark notices a tic he shares with Albright in a video of him and sees Albright in the same video as his assistant, and concludes that Jensen has shedded himself into Albright's body. Young Damian again hallucinates, because he loses his medicine, and collapses. The two drives back to the New Orleans and Young Damian told them to wait in the car. Young Damian finds Dr. Jensens wife, Phyllis, in a nursing home suffering from Alzheimers. Young Damian asks her if he can access his research, but she does not know. When Dr. Phyllis reveals that Albright came every week in her house, to bring butter scotch candy for her, she calls Albright to come in her house. Young Damian tranquilized Dr. Phyllis and he confronts Albright/Dr. Jensen. Young Damian asks Albright for medicine but he warns that if he continues to take the medicine, his \"Mark\" personality will eventually be completely erased, while if he quits, the \"original\" Mark will reassert control over his body and kill Damian's personality instead. But Mark flees when more assassins show up, including another man who he recognizes as Anton due to necklace they share Anton reveals that he has shedded multiple times. At a rest stop, Madeline confronts Mark over his behavior and lack of knowledge of their personal details, and he reveals all that has transpired to her. He takes them to his old friend Martin (Victor Garber) and convinces him to provide for Madeline and Anna to flee to the Caribbean. However, he and Madeline discover Anna playing with Martin's young son Tony (Dylan Lowe), who died two years ago; Martin admits that he used shedding to save his son and that Albright's men are waiting for them. Mark then reveals the dark secret behind shedding and flees to distract Albright's men while Martin, Madeline, and Anna escape. Mark manages to crash Anton's car with him in it and defeat his pursuers, but Madeline and Anna are recaptured. Mark stops taking his medicine in order to experience more memories, hoping they will lead him to Albright. This succeeds, and Mark pursues Albright to a lab built in an abandoned warehouse. There, Albright captures him and attempts to shed Anton into Mark's body, but Mark, remembering that metal interferes with the shedding process, takes a bullet casing in his mouth, therefore sabotages the procedure which kills Anton in the process. He rescues Madeline and Anna and takes down Albright once and for all. Mark arranges for Madeline and Anna to flee the country as planned, meets his own estranged daughter Claire (Michelle Dockery), and delivers her a letter reconciling with her. He then heads to the Caribbean and stops taking his medicine, dying peacefully. The real Mark reawakens in his own body and discovers a video message from Damian's personality thanking him for the time he gave him. Mark then reunites with his family at last.",

         "Sometimes I just don't understand so-called professional critics. I really don't. You give them a very good movie and they complain that it wasn't a lot better than it was. It's like they're going out of their way to be negative. That bothers me and that's why I prefer to call myself a movie \"reviewer\". I'm just someone who loves movies, sees a lot of them, knows a bit about the industry and wants to use my experience as a writer to discuss movies in a way that others might enjoy and find useful \u2013 and from a movie fan's perspective. I'm only out to answer one question when I review a movie: Was it entertaining? If I feel it was, I recommend it, giving it a grade in the \"A\" or \"B\" range, depending on how entertaining it was. If it's not very entertaining, or just bad, it gets a \"C\" or \"D\". And if the movie is out-right horrible, it gets an \"F\". Simple, right? Well, \"Self/less\" (PG-13, 1:56) isn't going to change the world, but it is interesting, fun, thought-provoking and well-made. It is, simply stated, a very entertaining film. What more do we need in a movie? Underneath all its action and intrigue, this movie asks how important a person's life is and at what cost a specific person's life should be preserved. Oscar winner Ben Kingsley plays Damian Hale, a New York City real estate tycoon who is dying of cancer. Like most people, Damian is more than a little unnerved by the reality of his imminent demise, but, unlike most people, he has the ability to do something about it. He becomes aware of a very expensive and very secretive process by which his consciousness can be implanted into a younger man's body, enabling Damian to survive, enjoy life and contribute to society for another 50 years or so. He's rich enough to afford it and arrogant enough to think he deserves it. Professor Albright (Matthew Goode) tells Damian that each body is an \"empty vessel\" grown in the lab. The body that Damian is given to inhabit looks a lot like Ryan Reynolds. The transition from his old body to his new body (called \"shedding\") is disorienting. Damian's mind has to get used to seeing a different reflection in the mirror and must learn to adjust to his new physicality. Albright puts him up in a luxury apartment near Albright's New Orleans facility in order to monitor the progress of Damian, Version 2.0. Albright also gives the new Damian red pills to help him suppress upsetting and reoccurring visions. Albright calls them \"hallucinations\" and says that they're a common side effect of the shedding process, but Damian says the visions feel more like memories. Hmmm. As the story unfolds, Damian learns to make new friends, but keep the old. In his temporary digs in the Big Easy, he starts hanging out with a guy named Anton (Derek Luke). Damian also gets reacquainted with two very different women from his past (played by Michelle Dockery and Natalie Martinez) and has to reach out to an old friend and colleague (Victor Garber) when things get\u0085 complicated. A sci-fi drama becomes a mystery, a psychological thriller and an action movie with several twists and turns. \"Self/less\" is part \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\", part \"The Bourne Identity\" and a little bit of \"The Matrix\". There's a lot going on to keep you entertained while you're thinking deep thoughts about the story's bigger issues. Some critics fault \"Self/less\" for becoming too much of an action movie and failing to more fully exploit the plot's intriguing set-up. But I have a feeling that if they got the movie they say they wanted, they'd have called it boring. This is an original, exciting film that is very well-acted, well-paced (by director Tarsem Singh) and well-plotted (by screenwriters David and Alex Pastor). The moral issues are never far from the moviegoers mind, and are still there to be considered after some of the movie's more frenetic moments have faded from the screen. A movie doesn't have to be completely original to be thought-provoking and entertaining. \"Self/less\" is both \u2013 and more. \"A-\"",
         "Damian(Ben Kingsley) a self made billionaire discovers he is dying, and does have much longer to live, discovers a secret facility that can transfer his soul into a younger body(Ryan Reynolds), when the transfer is a success, Damian really begins to enjoy his new life in his new body, but soon realizes that his new life will have a price to pay. I'm surprised that I liked this, I went expecting this to be bad, but I was amazed on how intriguing it kept me. It shows on we deal with dying and immortality, and things we must learn to face in life. Ben Kingsley was good, and Ryan Reynolds really surprised me. Matthew Goode was incredible. It does have some good action scenes, and great sci-fi element. Everybody gives a good performance here, and it does what sci-fi should do, kept you intrigue.",
         "This IMDb synopsis is accurate and a good starting point: Billionaire Damian Hale has terminal cancer. He turns to a radical medical procedure called \"shedding,\" in which his consciousness is transferred to a healthy body. After the procedure, Damian, now called Edward, starts a new life in New Orleans but is plagued by disturbing images. When he delves into Edward's mysterious origin, he learns that some will kill to keep it secret. My buddy and I, both long time film buffs of multi-genres yearn for decent sci-fi thrillers that are well written and directed, leave us guessing here and there via plot twists and turns, includes necessary action, murder and mayhem and a credible Mr. Evil. This film delivers 116 minutes of story, acting, production value and pure cinema sci-fi thrilling FUN. We were both thumbs-up entertained by one of Ryan Reynolds best efforts plus a fine supporting cast including Mr. Evil (Albright). Our usual post film discussion of plot holes was minimal given the original, well crafted screenplay. That is not to say we did not suspend belief as is the case with many of our best action/Sci-Fi films. A major section of the film, with some of its best action sequences, reminded me of my favorite scenes in Bourne Legacy. With all the above said there was yet room for disturbed, romantic relationships and one cute kid spitting out all her needed lines. Production value gives us some fun shots of New Orleans, area mansions and a finale 'home' in a spectacular locale. There have been so many mind invasion/transfer films that our expectations for something original with thrills, excitement and pathos were low. We left the theater smiling for the simple reason that we were both thoroughly entertained.",
         "Billionaire Damian Hale (Ben Kingsley) is on top of the world until he runs into a problem he can't solve, Cancer. His only hope is a new medical procedure called \"shedding,\" in which his consciousness is transferred to a healthy body. After Damian undergoes this procedure, he becomes a man named Edward (Ryan Reynolds). Once he attempts to start a new life in New Orleans, he starts to become ravaged by visions of his new body's past. As he begins to investigate the origin of his new body, he learns the lengths that his creators will take to protect their procedure and keep their identities secret. The film, I will admit, introduces an original concept that not many films have covered. It's a shame that it does not stay with it for very long. We start off with older Damian coming to terms with where he is in his life and with his condition and then the film pivots to more of an action film as younger Damian/Edward investigates his roots through his visions and survive its resistance. It was a shame that more time wasn't spent with the older version of Damian. This loss created a void in the story. It would have been better if we could have spent more time with him so his character could be more developed. From the little we got to see, he appears to not be that great of a person. If we knew more, we would have reason to root for him. The time spent during an unnecessary sequence in the middle could have helped with that. There is a lack of consistency in the character of Damian as well. The character is played by 2 different actors but their performances are not the same. There seems to not be any apparent, similar, alignment in mannerisms between the two Damians, they don't act too similarly either. That could either be because of writing, Ryan Reynolds' performance, and/or not too careful direction. The film had the chance to try to answer some philosophical questions relating to the value of human life or the morality of valuing a life over. When you start to wonder if this whole \"shedding\" procedure is even possible, you are forced to accept that it is. Instead of being about Damian coming to terms with his new body and life, it chooses the path of gun fights and car chases. This is the moment when the film falls into the realm of mediocrity. It isn't revolutionary. The twists will not come as much of a surprise either. The film managed to keep my attention but I would of preferred it to cover more of the philosophical issues relating to the procedure. The film has a good idea but it could have been portrayed in a different/better way.",
         "In recent times it seems like a sci fi thriller is a tricky movie to master, and whilst I don't pretend that Self/less mastered it, it's a very watchable and enjoyable movie. 'Billionaire Damian, a man responsible for enormous business deals, a big figure with the ability to buy whatever he wants, but not the thing he needs, a cure for cancer. Out with friend and fellow business man Martin a card is slipped into Damian's possession, Phoenix biogenic, with a message on the back of help. Damian attends and meets Professor Albright, who explains the procedure on offer, Damian's living consciousness can be transplanted into a new body, a body that's been cultivated. Damian accepts and wakes up a fit young man. Albright insists on meeting weekly, giving Damian the pills he must take without fail. As time goes on Damian starts having disturbing visions, the constant being a woman, little girl, and a pumpkin tower. Researching the tower he is led to St Louis, where he discovers the truth behind his new guise and the sinister Albright. I really did enjoy this movie, the concept was a good one, it was a clever plot. There were enough surprises and plenty of intrigue to keep you wondering. If I had one little niggle, it's that for me after the transformation to Reynolds it felt like a different film, it didn't feel seamless, maybe that was intentional, I felt they could have delved into the transition a little deeper, it seemed to happen to quickly. Lots of action scenes, really well directed, the effects were great too. I wish Google searches worked so quickly for me, Pumpkin Towers (All I'm saying. 11,300,000 results,) my he was lucky. Brilliantly acted, Kinglsey naturally has gravitas, he's so watchable. Ryan Reynolds was excellent I thought, I really enjoyed his performance, Matthew Goode I thought was outstanding, managing to be sinister without overplaying it. I love Michelle Dockery, but she was a little underused, just a bit part. 8/10 Very watchable, surprisingly so.",
         "When I saw the trailer, I was expecting a quiet little sci-fi drama about an old billionaire played by Ben Kingsley who gets the opportunity to live longer with the purchasing of a new body, played by Ryan Reynolds, and discovers his new body had a prior soul in it. The movie gave me a little more than that thanks to who the prior soul belong too and the large amount of trouble the creator of this body switching technique called shredding goes through to keep his project low key, when the billionaire freaks out about steeling another man's life. It was an action packed drama helped out with an incredible musical score. It kinda has the same vibe as a movie called Limitless starring Bradley Cooper and Robert DeNiro. The Sci-Fi concept is different but it's the same tone of coolness. Nothing in the movie is mind blowing, but it's very cool to watch and very entertaining, so I'll recommend.",
         "This is awesome science fiction. Wonderfully crafted. By 40 minutes in I knew this film was absolutely fantastic. A welcome treat among so many scripts that tend to walk the line of \"the ridiculously over the top.\" Ryan seems to be winning me over with serious roles, more and more, as he matures as an actor. He does very well in the roll that Ben Kingsley gets started in a journey to achieve \"Immortality.\" The fact that the film was shot exceptionally tastefully, had a great cast, and contained a worthy script makes it a shoe in for a good ride at the very least. You should take it. It's a return to what Science Fiction should really be. A continually changing bar or understanding of the universe as we \"dare to dream the things that might be within our grasps tomorrow.\"",
         "Self/Less follows billionaire industrialist Damian Hale, who is the master of his universe, until he encounters a foe that he can't defeat: cancer. His only hope is a radical medical procedure called \"shedding,\" in which his consciousness is transferred to a healthy body. After the procedure, Damian, now called Edward, starts a new life in New Orleans but is plagued by disturbing images. When he delves into Edward's mysterious origin, he learns that some will kill to keep it secret. From the quirky mind of Tarsem Singh, we are brought a Sci-Fi spectacle set five years in the future where immortality now exists with many consequences, having a new body, you need to take these pills so you don't have hallucinations or die. Essentially like John Frankenheimer's classic 'Seconds', this film is still a merrymaking Thriller with enough twist and turns to make everything intriguing. Even if we get a introduction to Kingsley's character in the first ten minutes, we all can agree that Reynolds portrayed him very ideally, being in a young body again can bring some rather exceptions. Matthew Goode, who basically plays the guy who doesn't set right with you, does play a mischievous guy with many tricks up his sleeve that do come In tack in the story. There are scenes at times where the story becomes a bit bland that last longer than they need too and don't move the story along. There are some characters that do bring blandness as well, they are a bit dreary and don't bring enough pep to the story and are just caught up in this web of madness. I might be nit picking but these are the only troubles I had with the film. The twists are hinted throughout and can be expected to be true but there is some speculation that makes you want to see if you're right or not. There are many stirring moments in the film from gun play, fist fights and to a car chase, you make yourself root for Reynolds/Kingsley to make everything a whole once again. Singh brings most of his usual flair throughout, directing such charming sequences to keep you motivated for what you're about to see. S/L may not be brilliant but at least it brings fitting thrills to keep you going!",
         "Even know this movie might not seem amazing to most people now, I can guarantee that in about a decade or even less, the movie will gain a following and it will be big! Absolutely great! We need more movies not based on any books, comics, movies, games, anything, just original ideas is what we need! This is a fantastic film! There are a few flaws in it though, but I do not want to spoil the film. Ryan Reynolds gives a very good performance in the movie, Ben Kingsley also does, everyone gives a good performance except whoever played the mom. Just wait, there will be a following for this film, there will be t-shirts and merch for this movie years from now when more people are seeing it, it should not have been released in Summer, where it is going to get killed, should have came out in September or October.",
         "I would actually give this title a nine if I myself were being biased, and I can be because it's a rarity that I make it to the movies anymore. I get pretty excited when I see something that I actually care about and this was quite entertaining for me..most movies are relevant to in different ways, so take that for what it's worth. I'm a movie lover. I saw this film with the hopeful intention of walking away with a little bit of a Born Identity kind of feel, something considered to be at least surface entertainment and I was not disappointed and that is an understatement. The action and story opener with Ben Kingsley as the main protagonist was well executed, as was the claustrophobia inducing transformation into Ryan Reynolds. One of the things I was actually worried about from the preview wasn't even about the content of the film but more how under the radar that I felt it would be in the public eye. Ryan Reynolds is not by any means a bad actor and that's his problem, with something so serious and Sci-Fi oriented we're almost reluctant to even approach his ability to draw you in. We see his films and usually know what to expect because he's so likable. Ever since Waiting he's been hard to avoid, but nothing about his roles offer anything compelling and that's not really his fault. I respect his quest for versatility..I really enjoy his role in this movie, actually..the things that are great about this movie really sparkle.. I have to say the best part about this for me would have to be the directing and the Music..my God, they really pulled of some wonderful suspense...some moments made my skin crawl..they utilize an almost Hans Zimmer technique likened to Joker's theme song in the Dark Knight but it doesn't feel rehashed. It's a thoughtful cerebral thriller with the fat trimmed away, it doesn't linger in too many places..the pacing was great. There was not a boring moment and in fact most of it had me cheering, mentally. I even like the ending, thought it was beautiful. The only thing that bothered me was the closing shot of the film, it was so simplistic that it was almost like man...dude, you could have had a classic on your hands, most may not take it to that level but I promise that it's at least likable to anybody. I loved this movie, it had great potential and totally delivered the goods. Every punch, every nuance counted and reminded me that the action genre still has the chance to break some ground.",
         "'SELF/LESS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A sci-fi thriller/action flick starring Ryan Reynolds and Ben Kingsley. The story revolves around a dying businessman who has his consciousness transferred into the body of a younger, and much healthier, man. It was directed by Tarsem Singh (the man also responsible for the popular 2000 horror flick 'THE CELL') and written by David and Àlex Pastor. The movie also stars Matthew Goode, Natalie Martinez, Derek Luke and Victor Garber. The filmmakers do very little with their interesting ideas; but they do deliver a fun, and stylistically thrilling, action flick. Kingsley plays Damian, a wealthy, and very successful, businessman; who's dying from cancer. A secret, groundbreaking, science organization offers to give him a new body; to extend his life. After going through with the procedure Damian is thrilled with his newfound youth, and very physically fit body, but he quickly learns that his happiness came at the expense of someone else's (the man who's body he took). Damian feels extremely guilty for taking another man's life from him, and he wants to set things right. The special organization will stop at nothing though, to protect their business. The movie starts out as a pretty intriguing science-fiction thriller; similar movies have been done before but it did seem somewhat fresh and unique. It doesn't really develop into much though, as it prefers to entertain it's audience with stylistically cool action scenes; instead of story and character development. Singh is a very visually satisfying director to watch though, and I really like the dark style and mood of this movie. It's hard to give it credit for a lot more than that; but it is an entertaining, and somewhat thrilling, action flick.

         "I found so many flaws in this movie that I could write a small novel. But I do not want to bore anyone more than this movie would ( Hint hint!) First of all, the movie lacks major continuity. I know it is supposed to be a sci-fi so I do not expect real stuff in it, but come on! The movie first portraits the main character as vain, selfish, super rich. As the movie goes along, our character turns out to be super selfless and caring about some strange woman and child. Nothing happens in order to push this Damian to change. Basically he pays 250 million to transfer his mind in a younger body. When he finds out that the body belonged to a guy who sold it for millions of dollars, he feels bad and wants to \"return\" it. SERIOUSLY?? All that because the previous owner of the body had a wife and a daughter who by the way received all that fortune after his \"death\". The wife is played by a plain actress, does not inspire any feelings or emotions. She is supposed to be \"latina\", but her name Is Maddie. Also the whole movie she looks like a peasant's wife, with her simple messy braid. No, no, no ! The whole movie makes no sense and has a typical SUPER PREDICTABLE ending. The guy who sold his body simply pops in back in his body and lives happily ever after on a Carabbian island with his peasant wife and daughter out of Damian's fortune.",
         "The idea of transferring your consciousness to a new body has massive potential for exploring future ethical and moral implications and how it would effect society and individuals. None of this was explored, instead once the body migration is complete we are taken on a boring narrow predictable Hollywood journey of a typical dude doing everything he can to save his child and wife, car chases, shoot outs, hand to hand fighting. Break for a pathetic scene where he bonds with the child and shows his sensitive side while the wife watches, resolve past life relationships and then make the \"self less\" sacrifice at the end so everyone is happy despite the young child witnessing multiple acts of violence and death. Someone should actually write a new script one day instead of churning out this tired old Hollywood format.",
         "This movie was a fun story to see unfold. It held a lot of clues at the beginning that all were unraveled by the end of the movie. There were funny scenes, thrilling scenes, and heart breaking scenes all rolled into one movie. I thought the action scenes were great, and the fight scenes were excellent, as well. The story line had twists and turns, and I was so surprised to see one of the characters actually start off as a 'nice' guy end up being a 'bad' guy as the movie progressed. And then to see how that character was used throughout the movie was very interesting. My thoughts are this movie had a lot going for it that the critics didn't give the movie credit for. The story kept moving, and the end results were truly self/less. Go have fun and see this movie, you'll be happy you did!",

Tarsem Singh isn't the greatest director in the world, by a long-shot, but his previous films have shown us that he is a visionary. The Cell was a load of old cobblers, but when we went into the mind of the killer, it was gloriously bonkers. The Fall is his masterpiece, beautiful, subliminal, but again, bonkers. The Immortals was a horrid affair, but it's set design was beautiful. Here, I wasn't looking for much, other than something luscious to look at, and Kingsley is always good for a slice of ham, but I didn't get anything other than déjà Vu to other films, the Island, In Time, Paycheck and Face/off (and Kingsley, even though he's in it for a short time, is ironically the best he's ever been for a very long time). It starts well enough, and the concept is sound. Like another film not dissimilar to this 'In Time' the film is telling you, if your rich, you can proverbially live forever. With 'In Time', time was literally money. In this film, if you are poor, you can sell your healthy to help your family, and if you're rich, you can buy it and have your soul somehow transferred into a good looking Ryan Reynolds type body. And as soon as the transition is complete, this is where the film falls flat on its face and loses everything it had going for it, which is ironic seeing as this is the exact point where Kingsleys' character is given a new lease of life. But the biggest problem here is Reynolds, I like the guy as an actor, and even though he's made some poor career choices over the last few years, he always breathes a bit of life into the whole proceedings. But here, he's totally autonomous as young Damian, and he hasn't put an ounce of effort into copying Kingsley's traits for effect (that's why Face/Off worked so well). So for the rest of the film we see Reynolds almost begrudgingly try and build a relationship with the wife and daughter of his new body's former owner. Goode turns up every now and again as Basil Exposition doing its best Agent Smith impression, and when we finally get to the rationale as to why this was done and how, you couldn't care/less about what happens to anyone. With virtually no advertising campaign on its initial release, it's no surprise that this soon vanished from cinemas. A Worth/less, soul/less dud of a film, but Kingsley is brilliant.",
         "Stick around for the first few minutes to watch a master class in acting from Ben Kingsley... When he leaves so should you. What could have been a brilliant 'Total Recall' type thriller is just another soap opera with blubbering women, needy kids and ridiculous car chases. It's horrible to watch. But the single biggest gaff in this celluloid effluence is the fact that the ruthless businessman (Kingsley) suffers a massive personality transplant after his 'shedding' and turns into a touchy-feely pansy. The second biggest (and even more painful to watch) gaff is hiring a child who can't act. Yeah, sorry kid... you ain't gonna make it in the talkies. But the best line in the movie happens about eight minutes in when the old dying Kingsley is trying to make a connection with his daughter who runs some kind of NGO in the city. \"This isn't work. It's a bunch of children throwing a tantrum!\" Just brilliant... and so true! Three stars out of ten... all three for Ben Kingsley.",
         "I didn't know about this movie until my mom told me about it. Yeah, I have a really cool mom :P :D So, I said let's watch the trailer and see what it's all about. Liked the trailer, so I decided to watch the movie. The idea itself makes you think about the decisions one takes in life and how they affect you later on, how regrets overwhelm you and how it is that immortality seems such a divine option that we all dream of and how that can be a total disaster if not managed correctly. Damian is a business man who finds himself in the last phase of cancer, with 6 months to live. He decides to go to this secret clinic to make a transfer of consciousness into somebody else's body. He is being lied to from the very beginning by being told the bodies are grown in the lab. He wakes up in this younger body and he tries to move n with life. Suddenly he has all these dreams with a Hispanic woman, a child and he suspects the lies he was told. He goes to find the location he had in his dreams and finds out that the woman and the child actually exist, together with the young man's body he now is. Here is where all his problems start and the action is really intriguing. I'd say this movie worth 2 hours of your time, it is not exceptional, but it's good. And Ryan Reynolds delivers quite a good performance.",
         "My Thoughts: There are movies that you see the trailer for and think to yourself that is a very interesting concept I wonder if they will delve into the deeper aspects of this and then you get to the movie and go nope not even close. Self/less is a movie that I wanted them to delve deeper into the struggles inside and outside of taking over a new body. We get a very little taste of that with memories that seem to force themselves on the new \"person\" taking over the body but they really side step all that with magic red pills that they seemed to have developed before knowing really that they would need them. So you really do not get a struggle for control because if you continue to take your little red pills then the memories will dissipate. The only reason this is an issue in this movie is because the company doesn't bother telling the people that they are moving into the new body that they body really isn't brand new but slightly used. And that brings me to the outside portion of the struggle I wanted them to show more. The company that does this \"shedding\" as it is called in the movie first lie and state that the bodies were grown in a lab but we come to find out that that isn't really true they had issues with the growth process. Instead of being up front and telling the new owners that the body they are purchasing was used but the previous owner gave up all rights to the body due to \"x\" circumstance they throw the new person into the body and then try to lie once again about the memories they are seeing and that take these little red pills and they will go away. Usually when I watch a movie even when I think it is bad I can usually find something good about at least a portion of it. This one I can't even say is a good popcorn movie. There are too many movies out during blockbuster season that I would recommend over this movie, maybe if it came out in the January through April time frame I could give my recommendation to check this movie out in the theaters but I can't do that now. With the three movies that are coming out today if you had to see one in theaters it would have to be Minions at least you would be entertained. So let me ask you if you were dying and a company came up to you and said they could extend your life and were completely honest about the procedure, would you go for it? My Recommendation: Rent It",
         "I want to just say thank you for bringing such a great story to the screen. It was so nice to watch a movie that was unpredictable, with great acting, and a beautiful story. This movie had everything in it without over doing anything. Most movies now a days have too much shooting, too many things blowing up, 1000 bad guys to 1 good guy (which is so annoying). This Movie wasn't any of those things. It was GREAT. And it was extremely refreshing to have the woman on screen dressed classy not trashy (not showing boobs, cleavage and their butts). I really want to say \"THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT\". I hope to see more movies that represent woman that way. Overall, FANTABULOUS. A must see.",
         "A super rich real estate businessman by the name of Damian (Ben Kingsley) is dying. With a decent chunk of his money, Damian decides to transfer his consciousness to a new, younger body (Ryan Reynolds). There are side effects, really important ones that are kept secret until after the transition. The modern, healthier Damian erroneously bumps in to these well kept secrets, changing his whole view on life and death. Ben Kingsley, for the first quarter of Self/less, is first-class, unveiling Damian as a man with power and notoriety. When Reynolds enters the fray, his personality doesn't match, as if the two didn't taken the time to fit in the character's affinity. The story barely breaks the surface of a good idea. Asking the right questions, but not filling the answers. Matthew Goode's head scientist of the underground company feeds us this information. The action and the flow of the story are thrilling enough, but not to the point of caring for the lead.",
         "So, here's the setup: really rich real estate mogul (Ben Kingsley) is dying of cancer. He lives in a high-rise condo that looks like it was decorated by Tony Montana and P. Diddy. Ben Kingsley does a great job playing the act of a dying man by acting completely normal. One of his last business moves is to kick someone out of business for merely saying something against him so we know his character as a little bit vindictive and self serving. He's also alienated his daughter and said she's been wasting her life on some Greenpeace- like charity. Then he's told by a secretive company that he can have a new lease on life at the cost of $250 million dollars and that he's been chosen because, alongside, Leonardo Davinci and Abraham Lincoln, he's just too valuable to society to lose...and he's such an egotist that he believes it. He's also shown a half-shaven Ryan Reynolds and told that this is his new body that was grown in a lab. After the brain transfer, which apparently requires having a fishnet over your face, he awakes to find that he has weird flashback memories that aren't his and also that he now looks and acts like Ryan Reynolds. His handler explains that this is just normal, and take his medicine. They set him up with a Lambo, suite house in the French Quarter of New Orleans, and he has a stream of ladies. But he still has weird flashbacks, so decides to track down where he suspects his body is from and immediately tracks down the wife of the guy who gave up his life. His daughter had a quarter of a million in medical expenses so he gave of his life to get his daughter cured. Rich guy finds this morally repugnant so begins shooting all of the people who helped him live longer. Why? Well, who knows, but then it devolves into an action movie with flame throwers, climbing through grates, and escape scenes. That's when I stopped the move and decided I couldn't't bear to watch another second of this drivel. 2/10 - Screenplay: Pretty cool for the first six minutes though but that doesn't save the movie. 9/10 - Filmography: Shot beautifully with some nice camera work. T 2/10 - Acting: I don't blame the actors. You pay them to show up -- you don't pay them to make your crappy movie make any sense. 1/10: Overall: I give this movie two middle fingers for wasting my time.",
         "I found the premise of Self/less fascinating, because it belongs to the genuine stratum of \"serious\" science fiction which employs imaginary concepts to explore the hidden realities of human experience. Unfortunately, the middle part of the film degenerates into a kinda bland action film with the hero chased by insipid villains, while he tries to defend a woman (and her daughter) of an unknown destiny. Shootouts, fights, chases... exactly like in dozens of generic action movies. Where were those captivating science fiction ideals left? They only appear on the beginning and at the ending of Self/less. The rest is pre-fabricated and predictable filler which dilutes the impact of the film and its speculative potential. Nevertheless, I found Self/less entertaining thanks to the solid performances from Ryan Reynolds and Matthew Goode in the typical roles of \"Creature\" and \"Dr. Frankenstein\" (respectively) who played with the destiny, and now have to pay the consequences. With the exception of the science fiction concept, the screenplay doesn't display too much imagination, but at least, it's well handled by director Tarsem Singh, who left his usual over- elaborate style aside for a moment in order to keep a dynamic flow of the action with adequate drama respites. Sure, Singh controlled his tendency to the visual excesses, but that doesn't mean the fact that Self/less lacks of style and aesthetic value; on the opposite, he took the maximum advantage of the locations and cinematography in order to create clear and visually interesting sequences, something which is helpful to overcome the most improbable points of the screenplay, and reduce the effect of the logical jumps and forced revelations we had already seen coming many minutes before. I think Self/less would have been more satisfactory if it had invested the middle part of the story into the contemplation of the ethical and psychological consequences of a \"mind transplant\". It deals with those topics to a certain point, but always on a superficial way, like if it was afraid of scaring the spectators who only want to see shootouts and explosions. In other words, the most valuable elements of the screenplay are relegated to simple details and hollow homilies, instead of bringing them the weight and space they deserved. On the other hand, the films with too much philosophical wordiness tend to be box office flops, so I understand the disjunctive faced by co-screenwriters David and Álex Pastor, trapped between a solid science fiction idea and the necessity of adorning it with generic action in order to attract a wider audience. I can give a moderate recommendation to Self/less mainly because of its creative premise and good direction, even though it fell short on its combination of genres. The promise of immortality for the greatest minds in History is a very attractive idea, and it offers abundant narrative possibilities; however, Self/less didn't have enough ambition to explore them, and it preferred the safety of the action format, in which it's simpler to copy what other films have done.",
         "I think this is one of the best movies of 2015, there is action, sentimentalism, a lot of cues of reflections. The narration is eventful, there aren't scenes in which you lose attention. We all think about the old age, when we will become full of wrinkles,unable to do anything, we all think to all the things we could have done. Time flows so quickly, we have scarcely time to make project but we don't have time to see them realized but probably this is what is right. Movie is based also on love: we all in life have to love someone, to cling to a person we trust in. It's expressed very well also the concept of \"loss of identity\":There's always a period in life in which you don't know who you really are, you feel lost, you don't know what are you doing and you start to live the life of an other person,the life of the character that is been created by your friends,parents,sons,wife.",
         "There are certain things that men (or women for that case) should not mess with. As in what nature is giving or taking away from us. The movie might make a case of that, if you want to look at it that way. It's Science Fiction alright, but it does have a moral core in it, that you'll either like or dismiss. Whatever the case, I'm sure many like the general idea of the movie, and because it is a \"secret\", this could actually be going on right now. But whatever you believe (or not), this will challenge some of your views, for better or worse. It might be very easy to see where this is going, but it's still a ride worth taking (especially if you're fond of the genre)",
         "I wanted to like this movie just a little better than I ended up doing. It's pretty good, but just not good enough to be great. It has a really low score (in the 30's) on Metacritic, so I kind of expected it to be bad. It is not that bad at all, though. It has a higher score here on IMDb, which shows that sometimes professional critics are a little too stuck up. Anyway. First off, the action is really good. There's some fighting, and some shooting, and it is well executed, well directed. The fights in particular, not a lot of fighting here, but the choreography is great. The story is a little bit of a mystery and is interesting enough. They probably could have done more with it, but hey. The movie could have been a little shorter, a little tighter. I'm a big Ryan Reynolds fan, so naturally I enjoyed it more just because of him. He plays a bad ass, and I like bad asses. The movie is well shot, and has a couple of really cool single shots. All in all I was entertained, and it's not impossible that I'll re-watch it some time."
