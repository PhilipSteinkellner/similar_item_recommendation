      "synopsis": "In the 1938 edition of \"The Big Broadcast\" series, the plot involves a transatlantic race from New York City to Cherbourg, France between a new steamship, the S.S. Gigantic, and the S.S. Colossal. Radio M.C., Buzz Fielding (Bob Hope) is in jail because he cant pay alimony to his three former wives. Dorothy Wyndham (Dorothy Lamour), a potential fourth Mrs. Fielding, bails him out with money she got from hocking her engagement ring. T. Frothingill Bellows (W.C. Fields) intends to send his brother S.B. (also W.C. Fields) on the Colossal because he causes disasters wherever he goes. S.B. and his daughter, Martha (Martha Raye), end up on the Gigantic instead (there are a couple of W.C. Fields vaudeville-type comic golf routines; in the second one, his golf cart flies to catch the ship, but it lands on the wrong one). Buzz Fielding is onboard the Gigantic to broadcast reports of the transatlantic race and to M.C. the various musical acts that entertain on the ship and those listening on their home radios. Also aboard are Buzzs three alimony-seeking ex-wives, Cleo (Shirley Ross), Grace (Grace Bradley), and Joan (Dorothy Howe), and Dorothy, his current flame. The first performance on the ship is by Shep Fields and His Rippling Rhythm (themselves), who play \"This Little Ripple Had Rhythm\" for a cartoon sequence. Next, Buzz introduces the Mexican singer of operatic and Mexican popular songs, Tito Guizar (himself), who performs two numbers: \"Don't Tell a Secret to a Rose\" and \"Noche de Ronda.\" Grace, one of Buzzs former wives, distracts S.B. Bellows, while Dorothy brings food to the inventor of the ships power source, Bob Hayes (Leif Erikson). They are quickly attracted to each other and sing \"You Took the Words Right Out of My Heart.\" At this point in the race, the Colossal is fifty-one miles ahead. The next performance is opera diva Kirsten Flagstad (herself) singing \"Ride of the Valkyries\" from Richard Wagners music drama Die Walkure. That exalted performance is followed by a comedy routine titled \"Honey Child,\" which precedes Dorothy's reprisal of \"You Took the Words Right Out of My Heart.\" Her song is followed by a comedy routine by Martha Bellows. When Buzz and Cleo meet in the ships bar, he is depressed, so she tries to cheer him up. In the films most famous scene, Buzz and Cleo reminisce about their life together as husband and wife; the song reveals that they still have feelings for each other. They perform \"Thanks for the Memory\" in a half-spoken, half-sung delivery. (Leo Robin's tongue-in-cheek lyrics are a catalog of questionable thanks.) Dorothy accidentally helps Bob fix the ships power source, so it speeds forward closing the Colossals lead. Next, comes another W.C. Fields comedy routine; this one is about playing pool, followed by Martha singing \"Mama, That Moon Is Here Again,\" which includes a comic acrobatic dance. Buzz and Cleo perform \"The Waltz Lives On,\" which develops into a production number that includes examples of the waltz, polka, can-can, an African tribal dance, a cakewalk (\"At a Georgia Camp Meeting\"), the Charleston (\"Charleston\"), and swing. Martha sings \"Truckin' (They're Going Hollywood in Harlem)\" as part of the swing section. Then in a rather abrupt ending, the Gigantic catches and passes the Colossal. Buzz and Cleo get back together, while Dorothy and Bob become a couple.",

         "If The Big Broadcast of 1938 is remembered today it's for the fact that it introduced Bob Hope in his first feature film and at the same time gave him his theme song Thanks for the Memory. Hope was billed fifth in this production behind W.C.Fields, Martha Raye, Dorothy Lamour, and Shirley Ross. It was in fact a Fields film, but it was also to be Fields's last film for Paramount and everyone knew it. Though there are some flashes of typical Fields humor, basically Fields staggers through the role, a dual role in fact of two brothers, owners of a transatlantic steamship line. The very thin plot of this film is the fact that two big luxury liners are in a race from New York to Cherbourg with a lot of money in various bets on the race. In fact that's where Bob Hope's money is, tied up in wagers. If he loses, his three ex-wives are going to clobber him with alimony, the three former spouses being Shirley Ross, Dorothy Lamour, and Grace Bradley. All three are on board one of the liners with Hope who's a broadcaster and will be broadcasting the race on a worldwide hookup. Of course the plot is simply a convenience to allow a lot of talented people to show their stuff and they do. Besides Thanks for the Memory, Dorothy Lamour has a very nice song in You Took The Words Right Out Of My Heart which she sings to aspiring inventor Leif Erickson. Thanks for the Memory is sung here and later recorded as a duet by Bob Hope and Shirley Ross. Ms. Ross's part in introducing what became the Oscar winning Best Song of 1938 is usually forgotten. Shirley Ross is also undeservedly forgotten herself today. She had a pleasing screen personality, a bit like Alice Faye and a good way with a lyric, just like Faye. Leo Robin and Ralph Rainger wrote Thanks for the Memory, probably the biggest hit that songwriting team ever had. The Big Broadcast of 1938 was the last in a series of Big Broadcast films. By then I guess radio wasn't such a novelty gimmick to weave a film around. The first Big Broadcast gave Hope's lifetime rival, Bing Crosby, his first feature film starring role. The film is part of an era of wonderful nonsense on the screen that was never concerned with any message of significance, just with providing the public with good entertainment. And with the cast of this film, it's guaranteed to be good entertainment.",
         "I really don't understand what some people expect when they watch an old movie like this. This one in my estimation, is light hearted and entertaining. It is a showcase for some of our greatest stars as they were just starting out. Is it their best effort? Probably not. But it is fun to watch if you don't take it too seriously. I'm awfully glad we have it around to watch. Being a fan of almost every star in it, I consider it a treasure chest of many favorites talent. W.C. Fields is wonderful through out the film. Some of his skits are hilarious! Bob Hope is so good in his role that you have to really feel sorry for his character. Of course the song \"Thanks For The Memories\" is forever linked to him with this film. Martha Ray is hilarious in another one of her zany roles. All in all, a very good and entertaining film to be watched over and over. A real, or reel part of history.",
         "Lots of mainly young and beautiful stars of the thirties appear in this movie. Dorothy Lamour and Shirley Ross are knockouts with the zany Martha Raye as a comic foil. This is a great movie for black and white buffs. Some classic scenes in this movie: W. C. Fields in his best golf playing scenes ever. Martha Raye hugging and puffing with her big mouth against a sail to keep a life raft sailing toward a big ocean liner. Kirsten Flagstad from the Metropolitan opera delivering a Wagner aria. But the piece de resistance is Shirley and Bob singing what would later become Bob Hope's Theme song, \"Thanks for the Memory.\" Although not listed in the cast, I saw Lucille Ball, probably with the most lines of any of her thirties' movies.",
         "THE BIG BROADCAST OF 1938 (Paramount, 1938), directed by Mitchell Leisen, is another one of those \"plotless\" musicals produced by Paramount in the 1930s, this being the most memorable mainly because it puts two comic legends on screen for the first and only time: W.C. Fields (in his final film for the studio) and Bob Hope as Buzz Fielding (in his feature film debut). Out with the old, in with the new. Yet Fields and Hope share no scenes together, with Hope getting more screen time than Fields (in a dual role playing twin brothers). The radio broadcast, hosted by Hope himself, is set on an ocean liner during a transatlantic race with another. Memorable moments include W.C. Fields golf game routine, and Shirley Ross as one of Hope's ex-wives sharing her \"Thanks for the Memory\" with him. \"Memory\" would become Hope's theme song for the duration of his career, and the Academy Award winning tune of 1938. In spite of her name placed second in the cast, Martha Raye, as Fields' accident prone daughter, arrives late into the story, making the best of her \"Oh, boys!\" and hi-jinx antics, as well as her song number, \"Mama, Oh, Mama.\" On the lighter side, Dorothy Lamour (who twice sings \"You Took the Words Right Out of My Heart\") is somewhat wasted with her limited footage as Hope's fiancé who may or may not become Mrs. Fielding No. 4. Aside from Lynne Overman, Ben Blue, Grace Bradley and Leif Erickson participating in the storyline, the shipboard entertainment consists of special guest appearances from Shep Fields and his Rippling Rhythm Orchestra (singing \"This Little Ripple Has Rhythm\"); Tito Guizar (singing \"Zumi-Zumi\" and \"Don't Tell a Secret to a Rose\") and Kirsten Flagstad (performing Richard Wagner's \"Brunnilde's Battle Cry\"). With the exception of \"Thanks for the Memory,\" the score by Leo Robin and Ralph Rainger is forgettable. The big broadcast finale, \"The Waltz Lives On\" (sung by Hope and Ross) is passable, with Raye stepping into this number briefly with her hot jive \"Truckin'\". It's also interesting during that same number to see Hope dancing with Ross. The final \"Big Broadcast\" musical consists of so much talent with little screen time, possibly victims of severe film editing. The theatrical trailer does include of Kirsten Flagstad performing in another opera segment not included in the final print. Although THE BIG BROADCAST OF 1938 can be a disappointment with too little Fields and too many song numbers unrelated to the plot, it somehow gets by. The musical-comedy did have frequent revivals on the American Movie Classics cable channel from 1995 to 1998. The license to air this was later picked up by Turner Classic Movies where it premiered June 18, 2001, as part of its \"Star of the Month\" tribute, W.C. Fields. Prior to the start of the movie, host Robert Osborne talked a bit about the this Big Broadcast installment, and the annual musicals that preceded it, starting with the one that launched Bing Crosby in 1932, and the second in the series THE BIG BROADCAST OF 1936. Yet, there was no mention at all about the third, THE BIG BROADCAST OF 1937, as if it never existed, jumping immediately to 1938. While the three \"Big Broadcast\" musicals are close to being forgotten today, the 1938 edition happens to be the only one of the four available on video cassette and later on DVD, as part of the double feature package with 1938's COLLEGE SWING, also featuring Martha Raye and the legendary Bob Hope. Thanks for the Memories.(***)",
         "There are momentary gems in this movie, and I recently bought the DVD because I fondly remembered it from its television broadcasts during my childhood. Hope and Ross's \"Thanks for the Memory\" (that's the actual spelling; it isn't plural) is so well portrayed that it seems they are recalling actual moments from their lives. This is almost the only moment of sincerity in this otherwise farcical fluff-piece. Martha Raye's \"Oh, Mama!\" is eye-popping primarily because I believe she did her own stunts in it, and she is bandied about like an unlucky mouse caught by a gruesomely playful puss. WC Fields sparks frequent smirks with his ostentatious manner combined with total buffoonery. Dorothy Lamour is only pleasant; I don't believe she had yet found her spark for comedy that was later displayed in the Hope & Crosby Road Movies. Her song (she only gets one but sings it ad infinitum to Leif Erickson), along with the remainder of the musical score, is surprisingly engaging. All in all an enjoyable musical comedy review, designed so audiences could finally see the faces of the performers they invited into their living rooms through the radio.",
         "Successful journeyman director with taste, Mitchell Leisin was responsible for many films of distinction like DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY, KITTY, HOLD BACK THE DAWN, and TO EACH HIS OWN. But he had to do many films that annoyed him for one reason or another. Occasionally a film he put a lot of time and effort into (LADY IN THE DARK, for example) was taken out of his hand and re-cut to it's detriment. Sometimes he was given inferior material to work with. He hated the material that became THE BIG BROADCAST OF 1938. He was highly capable as a musical director. Besides LADY IN THE DARK, he did MURDER AT THE VANITIES (which introduced COCKTALES FOR TWO). But this project was dropped on him because of other projects he wanted to do. The key to understanding this was that it was the last film for Paramount that W.C.Fields was to do. To his fans, Fields was a great comic artist - one of the greatest film personalities of his time if not of all time. But he was, in the words of Leisin, \"the most ornery S.O.B. I ever met!\" Fields kept on making demands in the production, such as a share of the writing credits (so that he could make more money from the studio). He also interfered in scenes where he was not wanted. Leisin, a man of culture and taste, put Kirsten Flagstad into the film in a segment. But Fields muscled into a sequence around the pre-filmed segment of Flagstad singing \"The Ride of the Valkyrie\" from SIEGFRIED, and made a crack that he thought it was a squawking animal. Leisin hated this, and subsequently announced in Fields' hearing that Miss Flagstad's agent was planning to sue the studio if the line was kept in. Fields raised no objection to the line being taken out. It's an odd musical. Like all the BIG BROADCAST movies it centers on radio and the personalities on it. But here we have the Gigantic - Colossal ocean liner race across the Atlantic, with Leif Ericson's revolutionary turbine engine that works on radio waves. It's doubtful that something like this would work, but the audience was there to be entertained. T. Frothingham Bellows (Fields in his first role) is sending his brother (S.B.Bellows) to board the Colossal (the reason is that S.B. is a jinx - he has been in every major ship disaster since the sinking of the Merrimac*). But S.B. ends up on the Gigantic, and does a great deal of damage before he realizes his error. To add to his bad effect, his daughter Martha (Martha Raye) is rescued with her boyfriend Scoop (Lynn Overmann). Martha is a jinx too (she crashed a plane into a mirror factory seven years before). (*This is not, as I thought, a reference to the scuttling of the Confederate ironclad Virginia (i.e. the Merrimac) in May 1862. Bellows would be too young for that. It is a reference to the scuttling of the collier U.S.S. Merrimac by Lt. Richmond Hobson and his crew in June 1898 in Santiago Harbor, in a doomed attempt to bottle up Admiral Cevera's Spanish fleet in the Spanish American War. Hobson won the congressional medal of honor for the action. As that was forty years before the movie, S.B. could have been on the scene.) The entertainment on the ship is handled by the much married Buzz Fielding (Bob Hope) and his assistant (Ben Blue). Hope was married to three women, all of whom are on board to make sure he continues paying alimony. His recent fiancé is Dorothy (Dorothy Lamour), but she gradually becomes closer to Leif Erickson. However, Hope slowly becomes closer to his first wife, Cleo (Shirley Ross). The film's one classic moment was their singing \"Thanks For The Memories\". Hope, in later years, criticized his singing of the song - it's done very wistfully and sadly, as it should be. He should not have been so harsh, as it became his theme song (not to mention the Oscar winning song of the year). As a pleasant time killer THE BIG BROADCAST OF 1938 is okay. It is not a film for the ages - and Mitchell Leisin would have agreed to that judgment. After it was completed he suffered his first heart attack, due to the strain of working with Fields. He never worked with Fields again. Fortunately he went on to better films. For Leisin's sake (and in honor of his health hazard) I'll give it a \"7\".",
         "This movie is very dear to me. I saw it on late-night TV when I was about 12 years old, tape-recorded the sound track and listened to it over and over again. This is a movie that has everything: wacky W. C. Fields bits like his golf and pool routines, Bob Hope bombing out with the crowd on the ship (imagine, in his first movie role he can't even raise a laugh!), bizarre but charming performers like Shep Fields with his Rippling Rhythm orchestra (whom Lawrence Welk obviously ripped off), accompanied by an even more bizarre animated segment. It's almost like watching a '30s stage revue of really gifted and varied performers, including a Mexican singer so beautiful he must be gay, and Martha Raye doing her foghorn bit. But the crowning glory of this film is the funny and poignant duet, Thanks for the Memory, with Bob Hope and Shirley Ross. Most people know the tune as Bob's theme song, but few know the clever, tender, almost Dorothy Parker-like lyrics. This is the story of a sophisticated but madcap couple, not unlike Nick and Nora Charles, running through money like water, traveling the world, and finding bliss in bed. Each verse tells a little bit more of their story in an arch, clever way that is never too trite because of Shirley Ross's marvelous acting. Her facial expressions reveal the deeper story underneath the actual events, a couple who were madly in love but stormy and tempestuous, with fights that may have included screaming and hair-pulling. Shirley makes reference to \"the night you came home with lipstick on your tie\", making it sound like an uproarious joke, while Bob rolls his eyes in discomfort. He sings of \"that weekend in Niagara when we hardly saw the falls,\" and Ross murmurs, \"How lovely that was.\" \"Thank you,\" Bob replies. This is a fresh and sensitive take on what could be a very sentimental song, and I can never see it without tearing up at the end. This movie is worth renting or buying, if you can find it, as a great example of '30s entertainment with the bonus of a truly great \"love-lost\" song.",
         "One must have at least a passing familiarity with the 1930s to understand and/or enjoy \"The Big Broadcast of 1938\". Without that, the movie is a curio piece to be remembered only as Bob Hope's first major film appearance and the one where he first sang \"Thanks for the Memory\" (soon to be his theme); W.C. Fields's last film for Paramount; and, perhaps if you're of a certain age, Martha Raye and Dorothy Lamour. \"The Big Broadcast of . . . \" series of films were strictly pastiche: an odd mixture of familiar film faces, radio personalities, and vaudeville, burlesque and novelty acts with an extremely loose storyline stringing it all together. For 10¢ and the B-picture with an A-picture double-bill, the movie would have hit the spot for most Depression-era movie-goers. The humour and jokes are pretty period specific, making the movies already out-of-date even ten years later. Without a map and a compass, the territory would be unfamiliar to audiences 70 years later. But that's not unique to \"The Big Broadcast of . . . \" series either. How well will \"Canonball Run\", \"Airplane\", \"Scary Movie\" and \"Meet the Spartans\" (all products of their time) hold up in 70 years? As others have stated, the best segment of the film is Hope and Shirley Ross singing the very tender and bittersweet, \"Thanks for the Memory\". Don't expect much from \"The Big Broadcast of 1938\", view it as the mind-candy of your great-, grand- or parents' generation.",
         "This was my third time in watching this movie when I popped the DVD in just now. It's notable as W.C. Fields' last for Paramount, and Bob Hope's first feature after years of doing shorts. It also marked the first time Hope performed what became his theme song-\"Thanks for the Memory\"-which, as performed here, was originally a bittersweet ditty of a love that had its ups and downs with Shirley Ross providing a nice share of wit in duetting with Hope in singing it. Fields is funny whether playing golf, pool, or trying to run the ship though I admit I rewinded some of his scenes to try to understand what he's saying! Two future Hope co-stars, Dorothy Lamour and Martha Raye, provide some charms along the way with Ms. Lamour singing a nice romantic ballad and Ms. Raye doing some great comic banter and slapstick. There's also some amusements from Ben Blue and a forgotten lady named Patricia Wilder as a Southern belle doing deadpan shtick. Oh, and an animated sequence produced by Leon Schlesinger though since he was just a money man, it could possibly have been helmed by whoever was the \"supervisor\" under him at the time like Fred \"Tex\" Avery, Robert Clampett, or Frank Tashlin. No great shakes but The Big Broadcast of 1938 is worth a look for historical reasons and if you find the people I mentioned entertaining.",
         "The trans-Atlantic race is on between the two great ocean liners, the Colossal and the Gigantic. On board the Gigantic (or is it the Colossal? Not even all of the passengers are sure) is an assortment of characters who present us with a sort of variety show over the course of the voyage: - W.C. Fields, ship's owner. He stops on the way to the pier for a game of golf (\"Stand clear, keep your eye on the ball,\" he tells his large team of caddies) and so has to catch up with the ship by flying in on his mini-helicopter. He's nuts. He has a daughter... - Martha Raye: According to pop Fields, \"She's an unfortunate girl�.Seven years ago, she crashed an aeroplane in a mirror factory. Broke 9,831 mirrors.\" - Bob Hope: A radio announcer broadcasting updates on the race, he is accompanied on the journey by his three ex-wives, who intend to prevent prospective wife number four from cutting into their alimony checks (\"She can't chisel me down to any 25%....\"). - Dorothy Lamour, who has second thoughts about becoming that fourth wife when she meets� - Leif Erickson, handsome and brilliant young engineer who has designed the special propulsion system for the ship. - Shirley Ross, one of the ex-wives. She and Hope get to chatting and can't quite remember why they ever divorced in the first place. The plot is an uneven mishmash, but some good songs stand out. Lamour sings \"You Took the Words Right Out of My Heart,\" a lovely ballad. Raye does one called, \"Mama, That Moon Is Here Again,\" which builds into a wild acrobatic dance in which sailors toss Martha all around the deck. The performance by Hope and Ross of \"Thanks for the Memory\" is truly excellent�it's a bittersweet song that we all know and yet it actually means something in its context of two old lovers hashing over regrets and falling back in love. It's a wonderfully touching and low key performance. In between these highlights is a lot of nonsense, some of it amusing. The plot doesn't exactly buzz along�it stops and starts too much before ultimately drawing to a rather hasty resolution at the end of the voyage. It is kind of like of a big broadcast, a radio all star variety program, I suppose. Taken as a whole, it's really not that great a picture�but it's certainly worth seeing for the sake of its numerous highlights."
