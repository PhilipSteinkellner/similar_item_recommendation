And there are almost only two actors, the other roles being very minor. Lino Ventura was Italian, Ingrid Thulin was Swedish. I suspect Brett 58 did not see the movie. Anyway... A property developer goes to his ex-wife's house. When he's in the house, he falls in a trap. It's not an accident: his ex wife wants to keep him in her basement, where the camera is most of the time. In their strange situation, we learn about their failed relationship in some kind of psychological duel. An interesting movie about the relations in a couple. It's not my type of movie at all (because well, almost nothing happens) but I still gave it 7/10."],
