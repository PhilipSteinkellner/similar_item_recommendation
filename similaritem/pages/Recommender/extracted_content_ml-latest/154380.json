I felt it to be very similar to the Argentinian film 'Glue' in the way that it was about boys coming of age and expressing their feelings. This isn't bad at all because I liked Glue a lot too. It's quite male orientated (and why wouldn't it be-it's about 4 teen boys) the activities they do together seem quite juvenile contrasting to the way they act with and perceive girls. The 4 boys all have different personalities, which makes it more interesting, they all joke about what the others think especially the more hippy one, Raol, yet he is the one who gets a girl first! One of the ones who usually teases the others ends up getting a surprise. Despite the swearing, it's really quite an innocent film about love and lust and you can't help relating to/feeling for Rik, the shy, emotional one. When all the others kiss the girl he likes, he just sits there looking awkward and uncomfortable, but it turns out alright for him in the end (luckily)!"],

         "While family is on holiday, Rik spends the summer holiday with three equally frustrated classmate-buddies in their boring Flemish hamlet, drinking and pulling pranks while dreaming of loosing their virginity. The publican's unruly daughter Sandrine, greatly to their taste, has a row with her riper boyfriend Jimmy and runs away. She becomes Rik's house-guest and lover. She fails to warn him dad ignores her whereabouts and actually reported her missing, so the police suspects a kidnapping, worsened by a misunderstood prank from Rik's envious mates.",
