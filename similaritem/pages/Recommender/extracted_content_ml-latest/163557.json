         "For a German drama this is pretty good. And for one starring mainly children it's almost incredible that it's as good as it is. It's tough finding suitable child actors who can convey emotions (other than being cute on screen that is). And this is far removed from cute on screen (though empathy obviously will play a major role on how you will watch and judge what happens). Jack is the title character and is as all heroes in movies troubled. But the troubles feel more than real, the movie filmed to feel like it is a documentary (without narration). There are big obstacles in the way and a seemingly unachievable goal that the kid wants to accomplish. It's not the feel good movie you're looking for, but it might get you thinking about a few things in life ... if you want entertainment though, look elsewhere",
         "I'm a real fan of stories about children lost in life because of parents that don't seem to care about them, or a society that looks another place when this things happen. Jack tries to survive in Berlin, day and night, looking after his young brother Manuel, with nothing to eat, sleeping in an old car, facing adults, and trying desperately to find his mother, this idea moves them with enthusiasm despite the difficulties they are finding every minute. The main characters, two young boys, 10 and 4 years old, are amazing, their looks, their expressions, their illusion trying to go back home, will make you think that even in an modern and European city, childhood is not always the place you always want to return.",
         "I am always so unpleasantly surprised, when i see an excellent movie get 4,5,6,7, stars...And then i compare those movies to really odd, out of passion and uninspired Hollywood movies getting, 6, 7, or 8..well if i see number 8 before watching the movie, I am almost sure that its gonna be a sh..y one, that probably got an 8 just because of famous names or and idea of a movie, that on surface seems deep, but in reality is just another movie without a story and a purpose!! THIS MOVIE certainly Doesn't lack of story and emotions and its one of the best I've seen in a long time!Heartbreaking, realistic story that keeps you in suspension the whole time and an amazing little actor that will go a long way! I hope and pray that enough *normal* people see it and grade it, because the grade 7 here is simply absurd. EXCELLENT movie worth seeing all day long!",
         "\"Jack\" is already the third common film project by writer-director Edward Berger and Nele Mueller-Stofen. The two are married as well and Mueller-Stofen, primarily an actress so far, has co-written the screenplay here and also appears in a supporting role. The title character Jack is played by child actor Ivo Pietzcker and he managed to carry the film nicely, which is even more impressive given that he has never appeared in a movie before. It's a very decent film with not too many weaknesses. One of the I found was the lead character's mother and here I am not talking about the way the actress played her, but about the way she was written. I assume it was the filmmakers' intention to create a character where you could never really be sure if you like or dislike her, but her permanent changes in attitude towards her children were just a bit too much to be believable. Early on, she defends Jack against her then-boyfriend when he throws his stuff out of the window. After an accident with the younger brother, she decides to send Jack to a children's home temporarily. Then she seems to revoke the decision and tells how much she loves him. Then he ends up there too. Finally, she does not even seem to care for the younger brother anymore and disappears for days, only to return in the end again to show how much she loves her two boys again, or does she? There is other minor criticisms such as the ending which was not really easy to understand why he returns to the children's home again. I wish it could have ended the moment they saw their mother return with the lights being on in the flat. Anyway, it didn't. Don't be confused though. I think this was a good movie and I would recommend it. The strengths of it were basically the scenes at the children's home and Jack being on his own alone in Berlin trying to get food, binoculars and more. If you live in the German capital, it is even more worth a watch as you may recognize some of the locations where this was made."
