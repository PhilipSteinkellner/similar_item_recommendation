In the course of his duties, Jackson encounters a Feeder/Gainer website run by an American named Michael Carter (Alex O'Loughlin). Carter, an intelligent, (and sociopathic) suburban husband, spends his free-time streaming live footage of women being fed to the point they become immobile and eventually die. Jackson rushes to America to save Carter's latest volunteer/victim, Deidre (Gabby Millgate), who is now close to 600 lbs, before she meets the same fate as Carter's previous Gainers. However, Jackson receives little to no support from Interpol, due to the fact Deidre is a consenting adult and no proof exists that Carter has committed actual murder. As he attempts to locate where Carter is holding Deidre and prove Carter is a murderer, Jackson enters a form of psychologival cat-and-mouse game which he may not be prepared to face.",

         "I just got to see this movie at the Fantasy Film Festival in Nuremberg and I was pretty astonished how many people actually wanted to see it. Cinema was nearly sold out and I think people got what they were looking for. It's a nice little thriller about a disgusting fetish. The audience gets to see everything. Puking fat women, sex with 600 pound women and some even more disgusting things that I do not want to mention here. But this movie has its weaknesses. Started from the tolerable but ridiculous \"computer hacking\" scenes in which \"dir windows\" kind of traces people all over the world, to an ending which is just not plausible. The movie tries to narrate a possibly real story and the ending seems to be misplaced. But as the topic said it's fascinating to see how far humans can go, although the movie exaggerates this a bit too much in my opinion. Acting was quite okay, story has its flaws, but all in all, I'd recommend this movie, because this is one of the movies you will certainly talk about after-wards. 6 of 10, not only for breaking some taboos.",
         "It was gruesome and full of strange oddities. The basic plot of a man force feeding women to death is the basic key of desire to want to watch this movie. Well, besides the crime investigator, and the hardcore sex, thats basically what you see in this movie. A woman being fattened up until she's so morbidly obese that she cannot live on her own, and is basically bet on for how huge she can get and how long she will stay alive as an extremely fat woman. It was enough to send chills down my spine, watching 9/10th's of this movie. If you wanted to watch something that scars you for a while, then in that case I deeply suggest you watch this movie!",
         "\"Feed\", to adopt a food metaphor, left me hungry. The premise of this film is excellent - it's the first movie I've been aware of that tackles the bizarre subject of feeders. Sadly, the strong cast is let down by sloppy direction. The film just isn't very cohesive. In the right hands, this could have been a very tense affair and a memorable cult movie. As it stands, the film lacks tension and any element of the fear factor. At the end of the day, it's okay but instantly forgettable. The film scrapes a \"7\" as the subject matter is interesting and the acting is very good....it's just a shame that butter-fingered director Brett Leonard manages to drop the ball. In the right hands, this could have been a simply excellent film.",
         "Feed has added yet another great twisted Aussie movie to my favourites list. An interestingly twisted story about a cyber-cop, a sociopath and his fetish with huge women. An intriguingly vulgar story about a disgusting food fetish, a taboo web site, sex, domination, and cyber games pushing morality to the extremes. A great thriller keeping you on the edge of your seat, aptly disgusted, with a new twist around each corner. This movie is a must see due to its shock value and eerie ability to make you wonder about what is happening in the world around you. With a great cast of sexy to repulsive actors. allow Feed to capture your imaginations for 90 Min's, to explore the never thought of and the obscene I can guarantee you will not be able to predict the start of this movie, let alone the ending! What are your neighbours really doing behind closed doors?? I dare you to allow Feed to capture your imaginations for 90 Min's, to explore the repulsive and the obscene.",
         "In Sidney, the Interpol agent Phillip Jackson (Patrick Thompson) investigates crimes in Internet with his partner Nigel (Matthew Le Nevez). After a mission in Hamburg, Phillip has troubles in the relationship with his liberal girlfriend Abbey (Rose Ashton) that tags him \"chauvinist pig\". While researching the web, Phillip finds a bizarre site where a man shows obese women being fed by him. He finds the origin of the site in Ohio, and without authorization, he travels to USA pursuing the pervert Michael Metszencalmpf, a.k.a. Michael Carter (Alex O'Loughlin). When Phil meets Michael, he surprisingly knows who Phil is; further, Michael tells that what he is doing is not wrong since he is releasing fat women from the standards of thinness imposed by the society. However, Phil discovers the true motives of Michael, beginning a personal war against the deranged criminal. \"Feed\" is bizarre, sick, disgusting; I have no doubts about it. However, it is also a scary and original story, with well developed characters and situations, and very well acted and directed. The association of the unpleasant plot with \"Se7en\" or the first's works of David Cronenberg or Takashi Miike is quite immediate. Michael is a clever psychopath, and his explanations about evolution and fashion standards are very impressive. Phillip is an impulsive detective that goes deeper in his investigations, but has his own demons in the closet. The result is a fascinating mouse and cat duel with a surprising conclusion. The gruesome \"Feed\" is not recommended to audiences of blockbusters or commercial movies; but for viewers that aim for a disturbing film that breaks taboos, they will certainly enjoy this movie. My vote is se7en. Title (Brazil): \"Feed � Fome Assassina\" (\"Feed � Assassin Hunger\")",
         "The basic plot: cyber investigators from Austalia stumble on a fetist website about women who literally get feed to death of their own volition. This movie will have a limited target audience. Fans of gross out movies will enjoy it, but there is no way an average person who pays to see movies like King Kong, The Transporter or Pirates of the Caribian will enjoy this. This target audience is a little more...less mainstream. It's gross. At times it's hard to stomach 600 pound naked women being force fed then puking. It's a different kind of gross from movies like Cannibal Holocaust, Salo, Hostel, Se7en. It's more disturbing simply because of the subject matter, rather then the gore. But at the same time, I watched the whole thing, so I guess it wasn't bad. Both the acting and direction were a pleasant surprise, I was expecting a mid range B movie, but got a real movie instead. Two things I would have done differently...1. Dwell a little on the 'fans' of the fetish in question (they weren't even addressed), and 2. either more of the cannibal issue from the start of the movie or take that scene out completely or tie it into the force feeding later on. I did stop eating though when I was watching it. A perfectly good tub of Orvil movie style popcorn, thrown away. So I suppose it accomplished what it set out to do. I won't rate this movie though. I will only say, it was well done overall, and if you think you can stomach the subject matter, seek it out and watch it.",
         "Story about an Aussie cyber cop who is on the hunt for a man who force feeds women to death. Pretty simple plot. But hey, it's pretty damn original one. But that's pretty much where the originality ends. What follows is a psychological horror with no scares, a few sick scenes involving food, pretty good acting, questionable decision making and some pretty good directing. I didn't care much for anyone in the film....probably the most was \"Deidre\" just because of the position she was in, but that's not saying much. Oh no, I felt for the Asian lady, since I have asthma too. I do have to say that the make up for \"Deidre\" was done very, very well. I was second guessing myself the entire movie. The movie is definitely worth checkin out if you're in the mood for a new take on psychological horror. I would definitely say rent it first, unless you collect films. Then Id say it has a nice, weird place in anyone's horror collection. Pretty good flick. Almost gave it a 7.....I just didn't care for anyone.",
         "\"Feed\" tells the grotesque and fascinating story of psychopath,who feeds his victims to death.He keeps seriously obese women in his dead mom's house where he feeds them junk food and calorie-rich slop to their hearts desire.Australian cop tries to stop this disturbed fetishist...\"Feed\" by Brett Leonard is an undeniably unique addition to the psycho genre.Alex O'Loughlin is excellent as the resident lunatic Michael Carter.The film is quite gross,but having seen tons of extreme stuff I wasn't shocked or disturbed.Still the subject matter is morbidly fascinating and there is enough nudity,vomit and deviant behaviour to keep exploitation fans happy.Give this tense and slightly repulsive thriller a look.The nods to German cannibal case of Arnim Meiwes are especially notable.8 out of 10.",
         "Phillip, Australian cyber crime officer, searches the seedy side of the internet, seeking illicit porn and snuff sites. After his last assignment in Germany, arresting a man wanting to eat himself and his accomplice. Phillip finds a site for Feeders and Gainers, where people (the feeders) feed food to the gainers, making them overtly overweight unable to move. Running the site, Michael Carter has his latest woman to feed, Deirdre, with an abundance of food for her to beg for. Without authority, Phillip flies to America to track Michael and stop this disturbing act. At a time when Australia is rebuilding its film industry; with great films Look Both Way, Wolf Creek, Little Fish and The Proposition, it was only a matter of time for a movie like Feed would make its way out of the woodwork. Feed is a twisted, very twisted, film on humanities consumption and the amount of food we're eating. With our society so concerned of being thin, Feed spins that notion on its head, where bigger people are more beautiful; while taking it to the n'th degree with Dedrae weighing over six hundred pounds. Like many films of this caliber, the hallmarks of a small budget are easily seen, yet isn't that the 'charm' of these films; rough camera work, corny dialog, overblown acting and a plot that doesn't completely make sense. As Feed starts off interesting, it takes a turn for the worst. Dropping the psychological mind game Michael was playing with Phillip, Feed turns into a chase film, becoming tedious with an overly drawn out ending. Its the move into familiar, predictable territory, where it was so unfamiliar to start off with. Like before, the acting is so overblown. Patrick Thompson's tormented cop verges idiotic, gruffing his way along. Alex O'Loughlin fails to evoke a creepy vibe for Michael. The best acting came from Gabby Millgate, donning the fat suit while repeating \"Feed Me\". Does Feed put you off food, no; Morgan Spurlocks documentary Super Size Me had more of a revulsion towards food.",
         "As another reviewer already mentioned this movie can send shivers down your spine. In a way it reminded me of \"Saw\" or similar stuff but fails to achieve the same level of fascination and suspense. The plot is not bad at all. In nowadays world you have to be very creative to invent a sexual obsession that is not already in existence somewhere. In this case it is some kind of fetish the bad guy is devoted to - feeding women until they look like Jabba the Hut after spending a year on an all-inclusive club vacation, thus making them completely immobile and dependent from their feeder. The women are being filmed, their \"progress\" is tracked precisely and the material is used to run websites for people with the same interest. As it turns out it is not all about sexual perversion but these websites offer the possibility to bet on the physical \"evolution\" of the women, including the time of their death. Good idea to make a scary thriller from. Unfortunately the movie contains a lot of unnecessary or completely illogical stuff that IMHO spoils what could have become quite good. I will give a few examples: in the prologue there is a scene in Germany which is clearly a reference to the widely debated case of the \"Rothenburg cannibal\". This scene has absolutely no connection to the rest of the film. It seems like it had been added after finishing the original work to maybe draw a little public attention to \"Feed\". Several questions are asked but never answered. Poor cutting I guess. In the end there's a twist (I won't tell you) which is inexplicable by what we've seen before and basically leaves you with no character to identify with including the good guy. The two main characters are portrayed quite well - maybe a bit stereotypical - but the movie misses out completely on throwing a light on the supporting characters although they are an important part of the story. There is no explanation why the fed women take part in the deadly game. What is their kick in being fed to death? I will not indulge in criticizing the movie makers' lack of knowledge concerning computers and the Internet. Let's just say it's there. i watched \"Feed\" while doing some domestic work and I guess that's the best you can do. If you want some distraction from ironing and need something to keep you awake then put the DVD in your player. I would not recommend spending 90 minutes of lifetime solely on watching this movie. Final score: mediocre."
