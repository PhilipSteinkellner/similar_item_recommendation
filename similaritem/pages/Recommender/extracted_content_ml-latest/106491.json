            "content": "I had some expectations on this movie. Samurai\u2019s, fantasy, magic etc\u2026 Sounds good to me alright. Well, as it turned out after having watched it I feel that my expectations was not entirely fulfilled. It is a decent enough movie. Certainly enjoyable to watch. But it is, in my opinion, not a great move and I cannot give it more than an average okay rating.\r\n\r\nI have not read the original story which the movie is, supposedly, based nor seen any of the other 47 Ronin movies that have been made. Thus I did not really know what the story was except what was the public storyline nor do I know if the movie actually follows the original story in any great detail. The basic story in the movie is a good one though. Classic, simple and perhaps not very original but a good concept for making a good adventure movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie is entertaining\u2026to an extent. There are plenty of nice scenes, action, special effects that all make the movie worthwhile to watch. The Japanese, samurai, setting is one that is not used very often in major movies except of course for a bunch of fairly ludicrous martial arts movies which cater for a rather limited audience and generally on a very low-budget.\r\n\r\nHowever, I never really felt much attachment to any of the characters. Even the half-breed, which are supposed to be the hero, never seemed to lift above the ordinary. The bad guy could have been any two-bit crook in a TV-show. The witch was a bit better but still rather meh. The Shogun at least provoked a bit of emotions but not in a good way. What an asshole! Not a shred of investigation when Lord Asano was bewitched. Just \u201cgo kill yourself\u201d. Then after the 47 Ronins had actually proven his innocence as well as proven themselves to be the most loyal and capable warriors around the dumb fuck wants them killed because they disobeyed his orders which where total nonsense from the start. As a matter of fact, the ending dragged down the movie quite a lot for me.\r\n\r\nStill a movie worth watching but it could have been a lot better.",

         "The reviews for this film seem to be pretty negative generally speaking. Pivoting around the historical inaccuracies and the addition of the \"Half Breed\" character played by Keanu Reeves to this legendary tail. More on that further in. In a nut shell. 47 Ronin has a fair amount of mystical magic and demons peppered throughout a historical tail. A tale of Samurai who's master is killed and their status is reduced to Ronin. Only for them to rise up and seek revenge against the evil ruler and his witch who are responsible. Let's get to some positive stuff. Visually the 47 Ronin is beautiful. The costumes design and color choices to separate each of the different clans is impressive in it's complexity. The villains are not just dressed in black, but a fair amount of purple and silver is mixed in to highlight the details in their armor. The sets have an epic feel that is grounded and doesn't feel to fantastic, but rather believable. Now on to the \"Half Breed\", who mainly adds the taste of a forbidden love story as well as a lifeline to the audience, drowning is a sea of unfamiliar faces. Many, if not most reviewers who've pan this movie for the addition of the \"half breed\" character fail to realize his importance for the audience. Around the start of the third act, there's a scene where one of the samurai apologies for his treatment of the half breed in a way that communicates to the viewer exactly where a Ronin places in the Japanese cultural/social structure vs where a Samurai does. The inclusion of this character and his treatment throughout the movie is an important plot device. Seeing his treatment by the Samurai as an outcast in the first act, then later his acceptance once they are labeled as Ronin is vital to the evolution of the main Japaneses characters of the story. Not to mention it helps to bridge a gap for an audience unfamiliar with Japanese cultural and social structure. Historical inaccuracy are common in Hollywood. I personally view the ones in 47 Ronin to be no more reprehensible then the ones committed in superheroes films. Yes, I am comparing changes made to characters from Batman, X-Men, Spiderman and Iron Man's cannon to this historical tale of the 47 Ronin. Deal with it, they're just stories after all. We really have no way to know it there really wasn't a half breed character, do we? After all, history is told by the winners, and often inaccurately. With a 2 hour run time, it did feel a bit slow to start, setting the stage for the second and third act. Once it gets going tho, it moved rather nicely. I didn't find myself checking my watch every 10 minutes wondering when it would end like another holiday release I won't mention. If the trailer interests you then you could probably do worst at the box office this holiday season. I enjoyed it, but that's just my opinion.",
         "It never bodes well for a film when its release date is delayed - much less when it's been pushed back a whole year, ostensibly to accommodate reshoots that would bump up Keanu Reeves' completely imaginary role in a Western blockbuster take on a classic, awe-inspiring tale right out of the Japanese history books. That way lies disaster and madness, one would think - and certainly the bland, monster-heavy trailers for 47 Ronin did the film no favours. Smack down your inner critic, however, and this epic fantasy flick - for that's what it is - turns out to be reasonably palatable fare. The bare bones of the true story are all there: the kindly Lord Asano (Min Tanaka) is ordered to commit seppuku - ritual suicide by disembowelment - when he almost mortally offends Lord Kira (Tadanobu Asano - a nicely ironic name if ever there was one). This renders all the honourable samurai in Asano's service masterless i.e., ronin. Led by the noble Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada), the loyal band of 47 ronin vow to avenge Asano - even though they have been ordered by their Shogun (top military commander) not to do so. What's less accurate, of course, is pretty much all the rest of it. Reeves plays Kai, a half-British, half-Japanese orphan who's taken in by Asano but treated like an outcast by everyone in the household - except, of course, for Asano's loving daughter Mika (Kou Shibasaki). Kira's nefarious plans have the support of Mizuki (Rinko Kikuchi), a witch who can apparently take any form she likes: wolf, snake or dragon. It's all a bit nonsensical, especially when Kai tries to get swords for the ronin amongst some pretty creepy folk who have gone from society's outcasts to being part of what looks like a supernatural cult. In other words, 47 Ronin is a faintly ridiculous addition to the wealth of Chūshingura - fictionalised accounts of the 47 ronin tale - that already exist in Japan. It's the kind of big, dumb blockbuster in which the good guys literally live to die another day as long as the plot calls for it. These fearless ronin even survive when the villain is protected by a witch with crazy mystical powers! She can set an entire field on fire, create poisonous spiders and turn into a dragon! And the ronin - at least 47 of them - live anyway! It's crazy! That's what makes it all the more surprising when 47 Ronin turns out to be... well,actually not half-bad. Once you've accepted the sillier aspects of the film for what they are, it's easy to get swept along by its very earnest drama and spectacle. Reeves' storyline is a made-up jumble of nonsense, but is played very straight - this is, in effect, Sad Keanu: The Movie - and it just about works. Casting Reeves as the outsider allows him to do what he does best: play the role with stony-faced reserve, whether he's levelling up by battling demons in cage matches or pining moodily after Mika. Kai's restrained love story with Mika is fairly predictable stuff, with the girl fading a little too much into the background (don't expect any bloodletting from Shibasaki, Battle Royale fans), but it's salvaged by the rather non-Hollywood way in which it all ends. For all that Reeves takes centre stage in the publicity campaign, the film belongs just as much to Sanada's Oishi. He undertakes a more arduous emotional journey: one that takes him from grudging to full-hearted acceptance of Kai's worth as a warrior and comrade. His relationship with his family is more fully examined than Kai's unwavering loyalty to the Asano clan. As Oishi plots his course of action, one that will bring him shame for disobeying the Shogun even as he avenges his master, he warns his wife and son Chikara (Jin Akanishi) to disavow him. Their reactions provide some of the most emotionally resonant moments in the entire film. All things considered, the title of the film is a bit of a misnomer - it would more accurately be called 2 Ronin, subtitled Oishi And Kai's Excellent Adventure - and it suffers from a lamentable lack of humour and historical accuracy. But it's not a complete travesty. Tucked away beneath a layer of mystical beasts and witches lies a story with enough heart, nobility and soul to survive even the oddest twists and turns.",
         "47 Ronin is a highly fictionalized take on the story of the 47 ronin who took revenge on a court official who had the 47's leader commit seppuku. In the film, Keanu Reeves portrays Kai, a half-British Half-Japanese outcast who is called upon by Oishi, the leader of the 47. The 47 seek revenge on Lord Kira, who also has an evil witch (Rinko Kikuchi) serving under him, who killed their master. The movie itself looks absolutely phenomenal, with amazing visual effects, an emotional and gripping musical score, and strong performances from Keanu and Hiroyuki Sanada, who portrays Oishi. The major problem that i saw with the movie was that, it was over way too fast. They left out important character development for the witch and a few other characters, which really could have added more emotional flame to the film. Plus, the movie overall could have easily been twenty, thirty minutes longer. If it were, i would say it can rank alongside 13 Assassins and The Last Samurai. The script was well-written in terms of dialogue (some cheesy lines), but the overall script was devoid of real depth and thought. Then, Carl Erik Rinsch's directing was actually pretty good, but had a few too many cut-aways. 47 Ronin is an extremely action-packed samurai/fantasy epic that is something you don't want to miss on the big-screen (for a cheap price). Though, if you want to see something award-worthy in terms of writing and directing, hope for a Director's/Extended cut on disc, for you won't find it here. But great performances, visual effects and emotion really help make this movie stand out, even with The Desolation of Smaug as competition.",
         "A band of samurai who have lost there master set out to avenge his treacherous death at the hands of Lord Kira. Enter Kai, a humble \"half breed\" with more to him than meets the eye, with catching favor with the fallen Lord's daughter, Kai must join the 47 Ronin to not only avenge his honor but save the woman he loves.. Very visually appealing with a nice blend of action and a wonderful nod to ancient Japanese mythology. I felt though that there could have been more to the story, simple and clichéd in some areas but overall an enjoyable film. Keanu does a decent job with his part but the true meat and potatoes comes from Hiroyuki Sanada, who does a masterful job in his portrayal as the chief ronin, Ôishi . The true pleasure and joy within this film is its nod and ode to the ancient Japanese mythology of the time, which in my opinion is done very well. Some may not understand the conclusion of this film but in a little learned knowledge of the culture one would see it for what it was intended for.. All in all an enjoyable movie and film for any fan of action films and historical fantasy.",
         "I just saw the movie and my expectations were met. It wasn't over-hyped, it wasn't over done as far as marketing is concerned. It probably could have used a little more, but none the less... It turned out to be a fun film to watch. I am pretty familiar with the original tale and legend of the real 47 Ronin and despite historical inaccuracies, which even most stories today are going to have to create a more dramatic and exciting story like old tall tales. One comes to mind as Frank Miller's Graphic Novel 300 which ended up being film, it was widely inaccurate compared to the true events that occurred, but it made the 300 Spartans look even more awesome and exciting to watch. Most stories have embellishment in them. Otherwise they would be kind of dull. The real world usually tends to be just that. Making this film isn't just about telling a cool story, it is to immortalize those warrior's that stood fast and strong to fight for what they believed in and at the same time make them look good doing it. The visuals were great, the costume design was great, the filmography was amazing, capturing the essence of Japan was awesome. Everything down to the colors, the landscape, trees, buildings and everything. Not everyone will like this movie, but I for one would recommend it to anyone that enjoys good movie about Samurai. This movie I thought had a good story. It wasn't great or Academy Award worthy but it was good. It wasn't all non stop action. The director did a good job of building up without making parts drag and become dull. I honestly thought while watching it, it felt like watching a live action anime. Not to mention, I have an obsession with Samurai so I was sold when I saw the first trailer for the film. Overall, I thought the acting was well done, I think Keanu Reeves did a good job. His character may not have been part of the true story, but for the film I thought it introduced something good for the film. First being an outcast and then being welcomed into the fold later in the film. I also liked Hiroyuki Sanada's acting job in this. I think he did an amazing job as well as the entire supporting cast. They all acted as if they truly belonged there. No one ever felt out of place. If you want historical accurate view on the story, I suggest you buy a book or do some hardcore research into the subject. If you just want to watch a good entertaining movie full of mysticism, and Samurai action. Then this is a good way to go. This is just my opinion, take it as you like. Watch it before you criticize it. That is all I have to say!",
         "My wife and I saw this movie panned by critics on Rotten Tomatoes, and the only conclusion we came to is they just were not sensitive to the culture of Japanese mythology. The movie was excellent. We had been dying to see it since the first announcements, and despite the critics reviews, we went. Thank goodness we did. The special effects were good, the story was good. Keanu Reeves did not come off as Bwana, the white savior of the poor little Japanese people, as some people might think, as per the usual American movies. He did stand out, but it was well shared with the Japanese actors. The story itself is not American, and I believe that may have thrown off critics. The ending is unusual, though I will not spoil it for you. I recommend this movie highly. Should you have the itch as we did, see it for yourself. You will not be disappointed.",
         "As this is a fantasy retelling of a historic event it takes liberties. However, for me it was about Honor above all else. I left the theater not only entertained and with a sense of pride in the story telling. As a veteran it resonates what I felt when we finished what we had to accomplish. I did not read the reviews going into today's viewing, however after I seen it I read the reviews and I think they got it wrong. This movie is very good with a lot of understatement and sometimes it gets fanciful but does not takeaway from the story telling. I believe if you go a see it you will be surprised how good it is.",
         "How could the paramount of Japanese culture be raped so viciously and repetitively? How could be be such a strong story be lost in a heap of self-serving non-sense, elementary school level dialogue, non-existent romance, handicaped action, unimportant, uninteresting, underdeveloped characters and so on? Well it's always a bad sign when you have character placed on a poster and he then makes a four-second appearance, not to be seen ever again(*cough* dude with facial tattoo). It is also a bad sign to start a movie with \"google earth like\" introduction, showing that you have literally zero information on the subject. But lets be fair and take if from the top. Let's take a peek at our cartboard cut-out characters. Kai, half-breed with obviously dysfunctional vocal chords is living with lord of Stereotypia, Asano, since childhood and will be pushed throughout the movie as a pivotal point in the conflict. That being said, there are certain heroes in action/adventure filmography, that don't really persuade you with their actions, but at least they provide interesting backstory that keeps you invested. Well, Kai amazingly does neither. Keanu Reeves brings out the best of his athrophied facial muscles and mumbles his way to the credits, with audience feeling absolutely nothing for his character or romance. This element of love and chemistry between him and daughter of Asano is as easy to watch as to observe someone trying to extract glass bottle from his anus with a metal hook... It is equally painful to watch, as this wedding-video/commercial director tries to communicate Kai's pain on unsuspecting audience. All this accompanied by Japanese actors struggling with English(yes, you guessed it, the movie about Japanese history is in heavy accented English). And it is not just the pronunciation, but the pacing and dramatic moments as well that keep the magic of immersion more distant than Christmas day in January. Just imagine a foreigner trying to console you in your mother language, after your loved one died. It just doesn't't work ... You'd be looking at him all confused and uncomfortable. It's same with the movie, except on screen they would give you an occasional Japanese word and then awkwardly try to translate and explain it in a same sentence. It goes for all the supporting cast and it is especially painful in case of evil lord's helper - the witch. Over the top, devoided of purpose and just all-out badly written ... if they'd put on a giant middle finger every time she appeared on screen I'd certainly be less insulted, just because I'd find it funny. You have to suffer quite a lot of pathetic build-up and looot of exposure to be hit by another of movies' \"highlights\". Everybody in this movie would not survive a minute in the real world, if their brains functioned like that. Meaning? ... Well, why not start with: If you do not want your enemies to crash your wedding, do not ( I repeat, DO NOT! ) let them out of the cave (you left them in after killing their master) right before your big day. It would be pain to continue naming all the dumb and inexplicable stuff this movie presented(you can name like 2-3 things for each character without even thinking...). There are moments when movie tries to stick to original story, but they are exactly the examples of when it should not to. According to original story, Oishi divorced his wife, but it was only to support his drunkard 'n' whoring lifestyle he took up to convince everyone he'd let go the idea of revenge. Sounds logical? Actually, yes. It was all plan that'd been in play for two years!! They tediously gathered weapons, intel, housing plans and were playing the roles of fallen samurai for two long years! Makes sense? Well yeah, it does, because they needed Kira, the bad guy, to let his guard down. And what does the movie offer?? Oishi is released, finds Kai, who is still alive (because screenplay demands it ... even though it doesn't address the fact that he kinda forgot his love interest) and rallies ronin who had no idea what to do for a whole year. Then there's this ridiculous quest for weapons, which introduces us to Kai's past, even though we don't give a flying f*ck about it by now. They get magical swords which are not really that magical and rush in numbers to Kira's stronghold. Couple of them die on a first try (fat guy dies and we are supposed to be sad I guess...), then attack again during the wedding. Kira dies, witch dies, guards die and so does the last hope for a good action in this movie. Director tortures us for a little while before ronin commit suicide, leaving me sad, insulted and confused. Sad for Hiroyuki Sanada, whom I like as an actor. Insulted by everything I paid to witness. Confused to hear words of praise from a seat above me.",
         "Compared to 70% of the garbage in theaters, this movie is both quite deep and fun to watch. It is not a huge budget movie, it doesn't have a perfect script or story overall, but the acting was great and the overall fantasy feel to it mixed in with samurai lore was really enjoyable. I expected this movie to be less than average due to overall scores. Don't pay attention to them. I'll be purchasing the bluray after seeing it just now. It has a slower beginning but it helps give characters depth. The ending is also quite spectacular because you're involved with the ronin every step of the way. The last 1/3rd of the film is as usual where the major battles happen, but act two does not disappoint. In my books this is a 7.5/10, gave it an 8 as its under rated on here. Approach it as a really good B movie and you'll love it. If you expect an Oscar nominations and a $200 mil budget for this, you should probably not be reviewing these sorts of films.",
         "Contains mild spoilers: For those who aren't familiar with the 47 Ronin, this film does it's best to bring the legend to the rest of the world. Although the film contains some great visuals, sets, music and costume design, infusing the story with fantasy elements and some new characters in an attempt up the action and appeal to a global audience is it's greatest weakness. The story of the 47 ronin is uniquely Japanese. It's the concept of bushido and how much one, or many, is willing to tarnish their honor in order to restore justice. Unfortunately things have been simplified a bit too much and all we are left with is a rather typical action- driven revenge plot that could have benefited from being slightly more character-driven. The original story contains a much more intricate build-up to the final confrontation that not only tests the groups patience, but their leader's resilience and cunning. Unfortunately, this film does away with these elements that made the original story so compelling. As good as the actors are (particularly Hiroyuki Sanada and Tadanobu Asano), i was definitely wanting more character development and drama throughout the film. Keanu's character as an outcast is an interesting addition although he doesn't really get much to do. His arc was fine but the character deserved more moments to shine. The villains were fine but could've been deeper. It would have been nice for Rinko Kikuchi's character to have some back story in order to pit her against Keanu in a more emotionally driven confrontation. After all, these characters were created for the film, so why not add an extra layer of depth. I can understand the desire to want to do away with the philosophical musings of bushido and character drama in order to push the action and fantasy elements, but the action, although generally exciting and visually interesting, lacked impact. I feel they missed an opportunity to really showcase the awesome fighting abilities of the samurai, instead opting for some CGI creatures and demons and a couple of averagely-lit night battles. The cut-aways seemed to cheapen the experience for me, especially during the seppuku scenes. It seemed to have been framed a bit too closely and the sound was a bit off. No doubt in order to keep it's pg-13 rating. Nonetheless, there were some truly moving moments and I found myself ultimately enjoying the film. Illan Eshkeri's score helped elevate the film's emotional scenes and I found myself with tears in my eyes at certain points during the film. Overall, I found the film to be serviceable. It had a lot of potential and it was better than expected, although I dared to hope for more. Some genuinely emotional moments and serviceable action and effects make this a good but flawed film."
