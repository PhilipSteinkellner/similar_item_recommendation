         "Hereditary phobias drive Millie (Virginia Valli)and her grandfather (Nigel De Brulier) to retreat from the world on a small deserted island off the Florida coast. There is some reference to the grandfather's exile as a self-induced political banishment but the two are so fraught with anxiety attacks that it seems implausible that they would get up the courage to ever leave their home in the first place. In another part of the world, John Woolfolk (Frank Mayo) marries and loses his bride in the same day in an accident. He takes to the sea in his small sailing boat (tiny yacht?) with his first mate, Paul Harvard (former Keystone cop Sgt. Ford Sterling) to forget and also to avoid ever falling in love again. Prior to John's dropping anchor in the island's bay for fresh water, an escaped homicidal maniac Iscah Nicholas (Charles A. Post) attaches himself to Millie and grandpa and basically terrorizes them both. He gets a hankering for Millie, constantly threatening her and vowing to kill her grandfather if she doesn't do his bidding which includes kissing and ultimately marriage. Millie has a wanted poster saying that Charles is an escaped murderer convicted of killing an elderly woman. Nellie falls for john as he stays anchored in the harbor and their love blossoms even though John is still in denial. He sails away only to turn around to retrieve Millie. Millie of course is thrilled he's back and when he finally proposes to take her away with him, she is afraid to leave. He convinces her but she is still fearful of Isach. They agree that she will steal away with grandpa before Isach is the wiser but Isach knows there is something brewing and catches Millie and Grandpa putting on their coats (in Florida?!) to leave. He kills grandpa and takes Millie up the stairs to the bedroom and ties her up. John shows up to get Millie, gun in hand, and discovering grandpa face down on the livingroom floor, he hears noises from upstairs and goes to investigate. When he reaches the door, the gun gets knocked out of his hand and Isach jumps him in a fight to the death. Isach is twice as large as John and motivated. Meanwhile, Millie is shown squirming in the bed half clothed (for 1924). It is quite a fight. After skirmishing their way down a steep flight of stairs and into the livingroom, John finds a knife in the struggle and manages to stick it into Isach. That at least slows the madman down enough to allow John and Millie to leave the house. Isach follows and gets knifed again. John and Millie make their way to the dock where first mate Paul is waiting and he jumps in to continue the fight while John and Millie make their getaway in a dinghy. Once aboard the yacht, they make their plans to cast off. Somehow Isach has found a gun and from the dock, wounds Paul in the head as his comes on deck to way anchor. Something that has always been present in this movie finally gets Isach and the castaways brave the breakers in rough seas to get away. Paul passes out from his wound and the once timid Millie finds herself navigating the breakers as John does the depth sounds. Somewhere in here Millie is able to overcome her fears and leave them behind. What makes this film magical is the new score. I amplifies the exotic nature of this tale. Kudos to the TCM winning composer.",
         "John Woolfolk (Framk Mayo) has his new bride tragically killed right after they get married. He decides to seal himself off from other people and sail the seas. After a few years he comes ashore and finds beautiful Millie (Virginia Valli) who lives with her senile father and childlike but violent Nicholas (Charles A. Post). Millie falls for John and, eventually, breaks through to him. He wants to take her and her father away--but Nicholas has other plans... Pretty much unknown until TCM showed it recently. It's a beautiful print with nicely tinted scenes and a great new score also. The film itself is just basically a nice solid drama--well acted and directed. Valli is beautiful, Mayo is masculine and Post is downright frightening as Nicholas. Well-done movie--worth catching.",
         "Interesting, atmospheric silent film about a man, John Woolfolk (Frank Mayo), who has isolated himself from the world after the death of his young bride in a horse and buggy accident, spending three years traveling at sea on a small sailing vessel, a sailor/cook as his only companion. The boat heads into an isolated Southern swampland one day, inhabited only by one old man, bug-eyed with fear of strangers, his lonely, fearful granddaughter Millie (Virginia Valli), and a big, filthy brute, described as \"part man/part child\", who is a sort of backwoods hillbilly, running around with a snarl on his face and forcing poor little Millie to kiss him or be thrown in the swamp full of alligators. Yeah, a real cretin. When John meets lovely Millie, it appears to be love at first sight for these two as Millie, apparently never having encountered an attractive man in her life, can't seem to keep her hands from touching, grabbing, and rubbing the front of his shirt. Well, our man is scared of falling in love again - so backs off from her. But - love may just conquer both their fears in the end! This film is really excellent with an involving, sometimes exciting, sometimes romantic story. The whole feeling to the film is greatly enhanced by the very nice on-location photography - scenes lit by the morning sun, and an exotic atmosphere lush with a landscape draped in Spanish moss, orange trees and orange blossoms, grandfather constantly peeking through the shutters of the old, rundown Southern mansion where they live, a constantly barking dog, critters roaming about, and the breeze flying through the mossy swampland - I felt like I was there. A well-done scene at sea where the camera is strapped on the rocking boat actually made me feel seasick (okay, I admit, it doesn't take much to make me seasick). The print, as featured on TCM, looked very nice, tinted in parts a variety of tones including sepia, blue, pink, and orange shades. The music featured here was suitably atmospheric, moody, and mysterious - a very nice accompaniment to the film. Very enjoyable and entertaining.",
         "Once again, Turner Classic Movies has done a great service to film buffs everywhere -- at least for those who have cable TV service and can get TCM -- with their TV debut of this film. Beautifully photographed in 1924, this extraordinary story gets restored to full health and with a new musical soundtrack. From the very first scenes, \"Wild Oranges\" captures the bittersweet theme of love and loss, and plays it in a moving but subdued manner. The film slowly builds to its final crescendo and it has a positive moral to the story: a few moments of courage is enough -- when mixed with love -- to annihilate a lifetime lived in fear and phobia-induced panic. Does that sound hackneyed, or 'cliched,' at all ?? Oh well. \"Wild Oranges\" ain't that at all. Perhaps that is because the telling of this kind of story in 1924 was not all that common. And if it was more common then than it seems, now, it still gets a 9 for the performance of Virginia Valli. This is a small movie by comparison with \"Ben Hur\" in that same era, but with great, nay, almost visionary direction and camera work. There's not a minute wasted in this movie. All the other congratulations, however, belong to the restoration team, the musical direction and the new soundtrack articulated for this movie. This is a long-lost classic of the silent screen era and its return, via TCM, is most welcome.",
         "Wild Oranges is a true delight! Seek out this treasure and watch it if you can. John Woolfolk (Mayo) is devastated after his beloved wife is killed in a freak accident. After her death, he becomes an aimless wonderer who sails the majesty of the seas with his friend Paul (Sterling). He and Paul come across a beautiful and mysterious island while sailing. They choose to stay for a while but they have no idea that the island is inhabited by Lichfield Stope (Brulier) and his granddaughter, Millie (Valli). The Stopes suffer from an extreme case of...fear. They're afraid of everything, especially other people. Also, living on the island with the Stopes, is a gross, vicious, homicidal maniac named Nicholas (Post). John meets Millie and tries his hardest to resist falling in love with her but with her pretty face and sweet innocence, he just can't help himself. He tries his hardest to save Millie from the clutches of the evil Nicholas and from her own fear... The new score for this silent film by Vivek Maddala is wonderful. Lots of pretty melodies drift within the score. This helps add a new dimension to the film, along with several lovely tints here and there. The only negative thing about this film is the overly long fight sequence towards the end. It dragged out way too long for my taste and not to mention it got pretty violent. Other than that, Wild Oranges is as good as gold. When watching this film, one can actually smell the intoxicating aroma of wild oranges and orange blossoms. One can hear the rushing of waves from the ocean against the sand. One can feel something strange stirring inside themselves; they begin to wonder about the mystery of life. At least it was that way for me. Will this film do the same to you? Go find out! :)",
         "Firstly, I agree with all the other reviews. My main reason for posting this comment is to clarify this takes place off the south Georgia coast. It's no War and Peace but is a fun viewing, expertly done by the very young director King Vidor. Also little known Silent Screen Siren, Virgina Valli, is particularly lovely and effective Southern Heroine, a real precursor to Blanche DuBois, living among her ruined finery. The locales in this film look surprisingly authentic. As a native Georgian, I have spent many vacations along the coast. I would imagine it was likely to have had exterior shots done on location. The set for the delapidated plantation house was also beautifully rendered. The exterior sets were also excellent.",
         "WILD ORANGES (1924) tells the story of John Woolfolk, a seafaring loner who turns his back on the world after the sudden death of his wife. In his travels he meets Millie Stopes and her grandfather, who live in isolation from the world due to the grandfather's nervous fear. The two meet by chance and a love blossoms between them � but will love conquer fear of the unknown? I found the movie very moving in many ways. The story had melodramatic elements and was quite simple and effective, generally quite low-key. Virginia Valli and Frank Mayo, as Millie and John, touchingly and convincingly convey their characters' isolation from the world and their yearning to break free from the chains of fear. Charles A Post is also effectively menacing and loathsome as Iscah Nicholas, a brutish bully who threatens the happiness of the prospective couple. The camera-work is beautifully evocative and expressive, with tint used as an indicator of time of day and mood. The editing is well paced and there are also some beautiful title cards. This is a wonderful little gem of a movie and an artistic success for King Vidor. I would definitely watch this again. The version I saw comes with an evocative and moving score by composer Vivek Maddala. SCORE: 9/10",
         "When he was barnstorming the country to promote films like Solomon and Sheba (1956) and War and Peace (1959), King Vidor often claimed that his best films were his silent features. Of course, having no access to these pictures, we didn't believe him. But now it seems that King was not kidding. Big-budget pictures like Love Never Dies (1921), The Big Parade (1925), Bardelys the Magnificent (1926), The Crowd (1928) reveal the artistic hand of a master. Now you can add Wild Oranges to this roster. True, compared to the above titles, it's on a small scale, but nonetheless it comes to a great climax and makes for an equally engrossing 88 minutes. If you really want to be picky, you could complain that Virginia Valli is not very attractively photographed, made up and costumed. But that is part of the reality of her appeal to the spruce, manly, admirably reticent yet handsome hero. For his part, the attraction too is evident, despite his denial. As you can see from the cast list, this is a picture with only five characters (six actually, if you count Mrs Woolfolk), and King does wonders in the way he keeps the story moving along most suspensefully, despite the fact that we can guess how it will all turn out. The director is assisted by his players, of course. Despite his self-effacement, Frank Mayo is superb in the lead role. It could be complained that Virginia Valli is a little too fidgety, but its part of her characterization and seems perfectly natural under the circumstances. More to the point, Nigel de Brulier way overdoes the bug-eyed act, but he's not in the picture all that much. Even the dog has a larger and far more important part to play. Ford Sterling strikes exactly the right note in his relationship with Mayo. Not too chummy, but loyal. However, in the acting league the movie is definitely stolen by Charles A. Post who possibly delivers here the outstanding performance of a remarkable career on both sides of the camera. Oddly, he bears a strong resemblance in both appearance and acting to Peter Whitney in the 1945 \"Murder, He Says\".",
         "When a windblown newspaper spooks the horses pulling John Woolfolk's carriage, his wife is thrown out and killed. He tries to escape his grief by taking to the high seas only to find reason to love again when he encounters an emotionally damaged young woman, the granddaughter of a reclusive southerner on the Georgia coast. But their happiness depends on his finding a way to defeat a deranged and murderous man whose lust for her and threats of violence have turned her and her grandfather into psychological hostages. Although \"Wild Oranges\" is a lesser known King Vidor film, its uncompromising realism makes it more satisfying and less dated than some of his more stylized and prestigious later productions. I will never forget the image of Woolfolk trying to revive his dead wife, her eyes open and unresponsive. Frank Mayo and Virginia Valli give honest, understated performances as Woolfolk and his new-found love in this 1924 film whose atmospheric evocation of evil lurking in a coastal swamp (images of Spanish moss waving in the breeze were shot on location in Florida) is somewhat reminiscent of the finale in the 1961 film \"Cape Fear.\"",
         "Newlywed Frank Mayo (as John Woolfolk) is out riding with his bride, when the combination of wind and flying paper spooks their horses. The runway carriage results in Mr. Mayo's beautiful wife being thrown to her death. Despondent, widower Mayo goes out sailing with cook and companion Ford Sterling (as Paul Halvard), for three years of peaceful solitude aboard ship. When passing by the coast of Georgia, they decide to stop for fresh water and food. Mayo sees a beautiful woman swimming; and on land, he meets lonely Virginia Valli (as Millie Stope) and her fearful grandfather, Civil War veteran Nigel de Brulier (as Litchfield Stope). They live in an old mansion, with slow-witted Charles \"Buddy\" Post (as Iscah Nicholas). At first, Mayo tries to resist Ms. Valli. But, she can't keep her hands off the seafaring man, and the pair seem destined for love. The simple-minded Mr. Post has other plans, however. Seeing love blossom between Mayo and Valli causes him to lose whatever is left of his mind� If this seems very much like the plot of a 1920s D.W. Griffith film, it was - he acquired the rights, originally, and perhaps hoped to star Richard Barthelmess and Carol Dempster. But, Mr. Barthelmess had left the Griffith company, to headline \"Tol'able David\" (1921). Joseph Hergesheimer wrote that story and this one followed-up, in 1922. It was considered a hot property, and \"Wild Oranges\" found its way at the Goldwyn studios, with director King Vidor. Mr. Vidor does well with the story's use of nature and the elements; the story begins with the wind and ends in the water. The titular oranges symbolize the sexual fruit Valli provides, as Mayo gives up mourning his first wife. The co-stars don't have a lot of chemistry, but pantomime professionally. Mayo took over the leading role from actor/director James Kirkwood, a former Griffith player, who bowed out after much work (he remains in the long shots). All in all, the best impression was made by Mr. Post, who grew whiskers for the role, and startled audiences with his villainous dramatics. But, although Vidor uses wildlife well, the story doesn't - missing, for example, are the scenes establishing the dog's relationship with the cast. ***** Wild Oranges (1/20/24) King Vidor ~ Frank Mayo, Virginia Valli, Charles \"Buddy\" Post, Ford Sterling"
