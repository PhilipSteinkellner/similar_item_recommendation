Which is especially unlikable if you see it on DVD. Compared to later space exploration IMAX films, this doesn't quite live up to expectations. There was an effect to partially soften this by showing space-to-earth still photography. But there's a serious flaw in an IMAX film about space in which the most stunning footage is of down here on earth! Ignore the IMAX angle, and it does have some interesting aspects. You get some nice background about the space shuttle, somewhat of a cool time capsule of 1981. There's much to enjoy about this film, seen purely from a documentary standpoint. Recommended."],
