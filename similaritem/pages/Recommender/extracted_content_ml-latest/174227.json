However, they jumped around in time like H.G. Wells' pet crack monkey. For example: Don't show clips of Breakin' the Law while you're discussing the early to mid 70s. Don't play Breadfan while you're discussing the mid-to-late 70s. This could have been so much better if only they'd not tried to deceive you about which music/video snippets occurred when. And quite what an original piece from Metallica was doing in the music, I don't know, this was supposed to be about Britain. It would have made sense to bring Metallica in for their plagiarism of Budgie etc., but it makes no sense showcasing their best original work, from the 80s, while trying to present music from the UK in the ~70s."],
