         "I have hugely enjoyed Tig Notaro's comedy for years now. I first became aware of her when she was a guest on the Comedy Death Ray Podcast (now Comedy Bang Bang), and have listened to every episode of Professor Blastoff (the Podcast she does with Kyle Dunnigan and David Huntsberger) at least once. Notaro has a unique way of looking at the world that I find hilarious, and an understated delivery that underscores her point of view. Having recently come out of an exceptionally harrowing series of events ~ surviving both pneumonia and C-Diff, the loss of her mother, the break-up of a relationship and a diagnosis of bilateral invasive breast cancer ~ her comedy has developed a depth and openness that her fans have responded to. I was not at all surprised to find this film completely delightful. Notaro's relaxed sense of humor combined with the comfortable chemistry she shares with comedian Jon Dore and their willingness to \"yes, and\" each other, make the scenes of the two traveling funny and sweet. Her up-close interactions with her fans were laugh-out-loud funny and heartwarming all at the same time. I've watched this twice, and enjoyed it even more the second time. If you're a fan of Tig's you already know you will love \"Knock Knock, It's Tig Notaro\". If you've never heard of her but enjoy clever humor delivered without fanfare, you will be glad you opened your door to her.",
         "I'll keep this short and sweet. This is not funny. They ride around the country being rude not only to one another but to their audiences. To top it off the jokes that they tell are not funny. She literally makes bike horn sounds and makes fun of the audience for finding it amusing. I see why no one has commented because on the of the rules for posting a review is that it has to me at least 10 lines. This movie slash documentary is not worth ten lines I was being overly generous with four. I'm still asking myself why did I even consider watching this in the first place as should you. Look again, read again, then ask yourself is this really going to be worth my time. If you are not a TIG fan please skip this one and listen to some real comics, I recommend Tosh."
