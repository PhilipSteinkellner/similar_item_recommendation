         "This was a well done version of one of the most favorite of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's tales. This version showcases an excellent cast, terrific costumes, and one of the best Edwardian locations yet. Other than Jeremy Brett's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes, which is the best ever, Mr. Roxburgh was a very believable detective. While Richard Roxburgh is a really good Holmes, Ian Hart is outstanding as Dr. Watson. He plays Watson as an intelligent, loyal, and very human but capable doctor. Ian Hart brought a fuller dimension to the Dr. Watson character to this Hound of the Baskervilles that many other version have not. I also liked Matt Day as Sir. Henry Baskerville. His youth helped make his character more believable than others who have played this roll. Richard E. Grant was a diabolical Stapleton and feelings I had toward him as the \"bad guy\" attest to his great acting ability, as I loved him as the Scarlet Pimpernel! The only disappointment was the very few moments when the computer animated 'hound' was on screen. When the hound was chasing Baskerville, it was terrifying but as the animal got close up and I could see it was turned into a computer animated composite of several animals, terror turned to unbelief! All in all it was one of the best versions so far and I enjoyed it very much. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys not only a good detective story but somewhat of a horror story too.",
         "The BBC, here in England, have just broadcast the latest version of Arthur Conan Doyle's classic Sherlock Holmes story \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\". I had my reservations about this latest stab at the old chestnut, I mean there's so MANY versions out there (including the legendary Hammer version with Peter Cushing, Jeremy Brett in his definitive series for television and who can forget Basil Rathbone's rendition?). However, despite my misgivings, I sat down to watch this new addition and I after watching it I am still reeling from the excitement it generated. The opening image of a dead body on a post-mortem table was spine chilling and shocking. It immediately set a dark and unsettling tone for the rest of this bleak adaptation. The cold colour scheme was absolutely amazing in creating fear and suspense. Mystery lapped at the corners and the fog whispered unseen danger. The cinematography was very stylish and very much in keeping with Doyle's original novel. There's constant rain, mud, mist, strange sounds, almost all colour is drained from the harsh landscape of the forbidding moor. The mood of hopelessness begins to seep into the mind which leaves behind a dour and disturbing emotion. The performance by Richard Roxburgh (from \"Moulin Rouge\" and soon to be seen as Dracula in the forthcoming \"Van Helsing\") has grit and edge which I found refreshing. Gone are the melodramatic cliches of the deerstalker and a pipe (props craftily employed by Rathbone to enhance his character) and in comes the reality of Holmes sitting on a toilet as he injects cocaine into his pock-marked forearm. Later we see him flicking the ash from his cigar into a champagne glass, these and many other habits are shown which indicate how untidy Holmes is in his private life but when it comes to solving crimes he is like a committed bloodhound. Dr Watson, played by Ian Hart, is another fabulous performer. Gone is the bumbling idiot of old and in comes a tough ex-soldier who has a sharp mind and a very focussed attitude. He even displays genuine anger towards Holmes when he learns that he has been used to engineer a plan devised by Holmes. Although he respects Holmes, Dr Watson also feels mistrust when he finds Holmes abusing their friendship. This again is very much in keeping with the spirit of the books. It is a myth to think of Dr Watson as a simple buffoon who just writes down the exploits of his superior friend, Sherlock Holmes. All the other actors were superb in their roles. There was a perfect harmony in the acting and their readings of the roles were spot on in every department. The music, cinematography, locations, production, direction, special effects, etc were wonderful and masterly. This gothic film could easily have been screened in cinemas, it has enough excitement and terror for any multiplex. Once again, Television leads the way forward in great quality drama. I sincerely hope that the sparkling chemistry displayed between Roxburgh and Hart will bring future installments in the adventures of Holmes and Watson on TV. There is huge potential and I think it would be a real shame if the BBC stopped making further adaptations with this fantastic team. I am now eagerly awaiting the DVD release so that I can enjoy this lovely gem once more. Go on, curl up in front of the fire, dim the lights, turn up the volume, sip your hot chocolate and be stunned by an evening in front of the TV. Let your imagination be transported into the wild and misty moor. Up ahead, beware the hound that prowls in the shadows of the dripping moon...",
         "When Lord Baskerville is killed by a mysterious hound, the local doctor covers it up as a heart attack and lies about the wounds. However he goes to Baker Street detective Sherlock Holmes with the truth and asks for his help. Holmes dispatches Watson to protect Baskerville's relative, newly arrived from America while he attempts to uncover more. Christmas TV schedules are full of one-off dramas usually with stars who have done well in America but have returned to keep their face about or actors who don't often do television series. This version of a classic story was one such example. As is often the case with such things, it is a good production and moves the story along at a good pace. The hound itself is best seen in shadows and quick edits as it isn't that scary but the film still manages to have a sense of urgency to it. Roxburgh's Holmes is suitably cheerful and feels outside of the murders, like he is enjoying the mystery of the whole thing. Hart tries hard with Watson and avoids the usual trap of playing him like a fool of sorts beside Holmes. Here he is central to the story and is onscreen a lot, but Hart makes him quite sour and colourless and he emerges as quite a pale character. Support was billed as `all-star' and I suppose it is in a way. All present themselves well and people like Grant, Tarbuck (!), Nettles and Cook are interesting additions. Overall this is a fast paced and enjoyable version of the classic tale and is easy to enjoy. Hart dominates the middle section of the film which drags it down a little due to his lifeless Watson but generally the film is well worth a watch no matter how many times you've seen it told.",
         "I read the book a week before I watched this 'made for TV' movie. The previews should have warned me what to expect but I still watched it. I was hoping it would be enjoyable but the insipid performance from the actor playing 'Holmes' was barely offset by the far more scintillating 'Watson'. If you've not seen it, don't waste your time. Instead enjoy either the Jeremy Brett or Basil Rathbone versions.",
         "Oh dear... It's easy to tell where this latest version of Conan Doyle's perennial classic goes wrong because so little goes right. There's little fault with the script, which does a decent job of retelling a by now overly familiar tale and even throws in an intriguingly Gothic Christmas Eve party for good measure. Some of the supporting performances are fine - John Nettles and Richard E. Grant in particular. But the leads are so very wrong that they sap the life from the thing. Ian Hart's Watson is surly and obnoxious, all too easily offended and trapped in a deeply distrustful relationship with Holmes. Since Watson has to carry much of the drama, this keeps us at arm's length from involvement, especially since Matt Day is such a dull Baskerville. However, where Hart is a good actor giving a misjudged performance, Richard Roxburgh gives every indication of being a bad actor giving a bad performance. He may not quite be the worst Holmes in the way that he was definitely the worst Dracula (in Van Helsing), but he's certainly the dullest and blandest despite his overstated distance and eccentricities, while the attempt to make him more of an action hero simply ends up making him a very ordinary figure instead. With all displays of Holmes' deductive reasoning dropped (even the famous scene with Dr Mortimer's walking stick is gone), his disguises omitted (he just appears on the moor as if he were still dressed for Baker Street) and his drug use wildly overdone (rather than resorting to narcotics when bored, he even jacks up in a public toilet while working on the case in this version), he's such a blunt bull in a China shop here that rather than pay the cabby for information, he beats him up instead as if he were a 19th century Popeye Doyle. Although David Attwood's direction throws up the odd good bit of composition, the grotty lighting and perpetual green tint on the original TV broadcast version sap any signs of life before they can bloom. And the less said about the shoddily animated CGi hound the better - despite the impressively populated London street scenes, it's hard to believe that this is probably the biggest budgeted version since Rathbone and Bruce strode the Moor. The BBC have previously had good luck with the tale - both their Peter Cushing and Tom Baker versions, studio-bound though they were, were more involving in their cosy Sunday teatime way. Sadly, this attempt to bring a more modern aesthetic, while marginally better than the dreadful Peter Cook and Dudley Moore spoof, is nonetheless a very poor show indeed.",
         "Watched this last night on ABC Australia. As a keen Sherlockian I was, and you may find this hard to believe, glad of the changes made to the story. Another attempt to retell the original tale would be unnecessary, and pointless. The hound itself was a big let down, a real dog should have been used, with a little additional retouching by special effects to give it more a \"horrorific\" appearance. The settings were where? Does anyone know? I cannot believe it was filmed on Dartmoor, as I know the moors well. The cast was good, but I would have preferred Richard E Grant to have played Holmes, surely a role he is long overdue to play? Watson was brilliant, and rather more true to the books than others who have played him. The handling of the Selden part of the story was superb. The drug use of Holmes was falsely and unnecessarily used, every one knows Holmes never used coke when involved in a case! I'll get this on DVD without doubt.",
         "Not being familiar with Arthur Conan Doyle's books (or any other adaptations of them), I was expecting 'Hound of the Baskervilles' to be a typical Agatha Christie-style mystery. But the characters are less ridiculous than in something like 'Poirot' and Holmes' detection is really quite conventional, he gathers evidence and tracks down his man in a logical, thorough manner: the crime is also quite believable. Holmes and Watson are both men of action as well as thought: Holmes is arrogant and would even risk letting a man die to prove his theories, while Watson is decent, far from a fool, but annoyed to be patronised by his master. Regardless of whether this is true to the book, it sounds like the basis for an interesting period police procedural. Unfortunately the whole thing falls a bit flat: although it may be filmed as a thriller, there's a curious lack of tension throughout: no-one acts as if they are really scared or shocked at any point. Even Richard E. Grant is for once (by his standards) relatively understated: there's no terror to carry the film. And there's something curiously uncinematic about the way Holmes solves this crime. He seems to know who the villain is simply by having done some prior research - very rarely do his deductions actually follow from his observations, rather his conclusions are just periodically thrown at us as fact. What also doesn't help is the strange mixture of natural outdoor, studio, and computer-generated settings: the aim is presumably to increase the impact, but it has the opposite effect, as one struggles to believe in the composite geography. In conclusion, 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' deserves some credit for rising above pantomime: but it's badly directed and dreadfully dull. A shame.",
         "The Hound of the Baskervilles is one of the most gripping,brooding and atmospheric thrillers ever written. It perfectly captures the Victorian psyche incorporating as it does all the elements of gentlemanly chivalry and courage against fiendishly twisted evil and callousness. Add a dose of the supernatural set against the dark and forbidding moors of Dartmoor and the stage is set. Unfortunately this film achieves the almost impossible in capturing absolutely nothing of the original. The main characters are preposterous and bear no comparison whatever with Conan Doyle's description. I am not aware that Sherlock Holmes had a convoluted mixture of Southern Hemisphere accents and Watson reminds me of an East London spiv.The plot does not stay true to the book and the drug taking scenes are not in context and appear merely as gratuitous. There is no need for the makers to have \"improved\" the original story by adding scenes of their own e.g Watson being shot,Holmes falling into the mire etc. Best of all the Hound ,when eventually seen, is obviously an import from \"The Lost World\" looking as it does a cross between a sabre toothed tiger and a crocodile. This is poor fare and a waste of a lot of money and time. Worse it is the latest in a long line of failures to tell this story with the imagination and attention to detail it deserves. Conan Doyle has done the work ,it merely needs faithful reproduction. Sadly it appears there is no one able enough for this task.",
         "I've watched this movie a couple of times, and have been able to distill what I liked, and didn't like. So, first. I liked Ian Hart as Watson. He played a Watson with integrity, intelligence, all the while still keeping the character sympathetic with that big heartedness Holmes outwardly seems to lack. Secondly, I also liked the strained relationship between Holmes and Watson. Two men that have so many opposing personality traits cannot help but experience some friction at some point in their friendship. As well, I recall reading a theory that Holmes and Watson, based on the canon, may have had a falling out at some point. I saw this as perhaps being an interpretation of that. Plus, if you read A Study in Scarlet, Holmes and Watson were not fast friends. In fact, it took Watson a bit of time to not look at Holmes as some sort of freak. Now, to what I didn't like. I did not like the scene where Holmes shot up. Yes, he was a cocaine and morphine addict. But, he used it as a means of stimulation to escape the boredom in between cases... not to provide clarity during a case. That, really, was my only beef with that scene. If it had been an early scene where he was bored and the Baskerville case had not yet crossed his threshold, then that would have been better. As well, I wasn't keen on Richard's accent. Sorry, I had the same bug about Matt Frewer's accent too (though his progressively got better in the Whitechapel Vampire... but I digress). I'm of the belief that if you cannot pull off the accent, use your natural one. If the acting is good, no one will really notice that Holmes' sounds like he's from Australia (or in Frewer's case, Canada). Hey, Sean Connery played a Brit (James Bond), and a Russian (Red October) using his natural Scottish burr... and it worked! Otherwise, this movie, despite deviating from the original novella, was very good. Good scenery, effects, acting, and atmosphere. So, that's 2 for and 2 against... but since I've seen it multiple times and still enjoy it, I give it 7/10.",
         "The good bits - the sense of period was reasonably well captured, and it began with some genuinely frightening scenes. The minor characters of the Barrymores and the convict were also very well done. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there, Richard Roxburgh was an uninspiring Holmes. The relationship with Watson was clearly misunderstood, and personally I found his rather surly characterisation irritating, Dr Watson is supposed to be conduit for Holmes' brilliance, so us mere mortals understand what is going on not to behave like a spoilt schoolboy made a mockery of. The character of Stapleton was too big, and far too obvious. No offence to Richard E Grant, but his manic, nervy, edgy style was completely wrong from the beginning. You are expected to believe that another claimant to the Baskerville title and lands would have hidden in plain view in such a flamboyantly obvious manner, and not have aroused people's suspicions? It then got worse. The violent end for \"Miss\" Stapleton was unpleasant, not in the book, and totally unnecessary. The hound was dreadful, some of the worst CGI I have ever seen. The end of the story was changed for no apparent reason, and was not an improvement. The blood and gore, merely gratuitous; Holmes floundering in the bog, and Dr Watson's sharp shooting act finally killing Stapleton totally missed the point of the true ending."
