            "content": "> Being pro nanny isn't an option to babysit some kids.\r\n\r\nI don't know how many you will agree with me that it was an underrated movie of the year. This film was so poetic, very unusual theme, but you have to understand it, otherwise it will be a plain babysitting movie. I believe as the filmmaker said, it was inspired by the real and so tried to be true as much as possible. The entire film was shot in just 20 days and there's no compromise in quality or the performances.\r\n\r\nIt was a tight call, to label it as a coming-of-age movie, because the definition does not match as the boy in the film was very matured, but only the end answers for that. It all begins with a 23 year old Eleanor, who broke-up with her boyfriend, at a same time lost the job. Standing in the middle of the street knowing nothing about what to do next, luckily a job offer comes her way. A temporary nanny job, to look after a 12 year old wealthy prodigy, Reggie. Subsequently the true narration begins where these two spend those two months together.\r\n\r\n> \"Welcome to the weirdness. I'm just trying to navigate\r\n> a course towards safety & sanity best way I know how.\"\r\n\r\nI have seen many movies of Leighton Meester, but not that at least one pops-out of my mind, other than maybe 'The Roommates'. This film might not bring her any awards, but definitely remembered for her simple and perfect character display. I have never seen this boy before, he was just a movie old and awesome as a genius boy. The screenplay was very naturalistic, sensitive, no twists, no sideshows, whatsoever to distract from the main focal point. There's only one perspective where the story flows in one direction, i.e., these two characters. Only the end splits as similar to the opening sequences like the before they came together.\r\n\r\nThe movie reminded me 'Uptown Girls', except the boy in place the girl. Only for the one reason, because in both the film the kids were very smart and matured more than their nannies. One film was a comedy-drama and the other one was a music-drama. But like I earlier mentioned, the end scene leaves a new dimensional meaning of the movie you have watched and understood from the initial parts. \r\n\r\nIt runs at the pace of a snail, so requires patience, but the music was so sweet that you might adapt the slow narration and drift till the end like I did. The film is not proving anything, but just an another perspective of one of the human emotion from the millions relating to the relationship and its uncertainty. The best way to get the movie is trying to understand the fusion of the characters from their mentality, not by the physical appearances. I suggest simply to skip it if you are looking for an entertainment or the inspiration, because it is none of that. An ordinary flick with an emotional conclusion and only a very few would end in happy of seeing it.\r\n\r\n7.5/10",

         "This drama paints a striking portrait of Reggie (Julian Shatkin), a wealthy and neglected twelve-year-old prodigy with the maturity of a middle-aged man; and Eleanor ( Leighton Meester), a broke ex-musician in her twenties recently out of work, boyfriend and home, who lands a job as Reggie's au pair for the summer in Manhattan while his mother (Debra Messing) travels overseas. Written and directed by Frank Whaley, produced by Uri Singer, and breathtaking cinematography by James Jones. This film took a very different, almost romantic approach with a charming, artistic, sensitive yet domineering child rather than the traditional spoiled brat who hates the nanny. The two hit it off right away. Eleanor naturally accepts his maturity and treats him as an equal when she realizes that trying to be the grown-up in the relationship is pointless in the company of a genius. In many ways, Reggie takes better care of her than she does of him. The conflict doesn't stem from the relationship between these two unlikely friends, but from their personal lives. This could have been why it felt a bit lacking in conflict overall, because no major problems arise between the two main characters. However, this blossoming friendship is where the unexpected bulk of the humor comes from, with witty and surprising dialogue between these very different but equally troubled characters learning how to co-exist. Several things were set up or talked about that were never paid off, which underplayed the conflict and there wasn't enough of a resolution. Rather than showing how the characters have grown or been changed and strengthened by one another, the whole final act kind of feels like a montage of shots of them missing each other while trying to go back to their previous lives. Very good acting, Julian Shatkin is phenomenal, the film is worth watching for his performance alone; not to take away from the rest of the cast. Leighton Meester is very natural in her role, Debra Messing is quite funny as an unjustifiably stressed-out woman whose normal routine includes going to the spa and on exotic vacations; and Georgia Ximenes Lifsherr is hilarious as Eleanor's best friend Silvia. Even Eleanor's parents who, while not in much of the film, manage to stay memorable with their hostile quirks. We weren't very impressed with Billie Joe Armstrong's performance as Dennis, Eleanor's boyfriend. His style was pretty over-the-top and childlike, very \"acty,\" not terribly believable. Overall film score: 9/10. Here's the breakdown: � Story: 8/10 � Characters: 10/10 � Acting: 9/10 (would be 10/10 if not for Billie Joe's performance) � Cinematography: 10/10 � Soundtrack: 10/10 � Most Lacked: Conflict & Character Arc",
         "10/10 Masterpiece. Some are calling this melancholy, but I think bittersweet is a better word. Above all, it's a story about a 12 year-old music prodigy being played by a c. 12 year-old acting prodigy. As good as child acting has gotten, few if any could have pulled this off as well. What's the significance of 12? It's that age where you're as mature as you're going to get before the onset of puberty. But what if your emotional maturity and profound awareness outstrip your physical growth? It's about resigning yourself to your solitude, until.... The result is a bittersweet gulf between two otherwise kindred souls. This isn't about dramatic friction, it's about something distinctive, enigmatic and fleeting. It's like playing a beautiful tune on a cello in an empty swimming pool with good acoustics. It's like Sunday, like rain. Maybe the best \"child\" performance ever.",
         "\"Like Sunday, Like Rain\" (2014 release; 105 min.) brings the story of Eleanor and Reggie. As the movie opens, we see Reggie wake up and start his day. Reggie is a 12 yr. old wunderkind who plays the cello and is a math-whiz, but he's also living a pretty lonely existence even if in a well-to-do environment. His mom is having a fit because the live-in nanny just quit (or was forced to leave the country because of her visa). In a parallel story, we also get to know Eleanor, in her early 20s. She also just woke up, realizing her boyfriend never came home the night before. It's not long before Eleanor breaks up and moves out, and in a subsequent confrontation by her ex-boyfriend at her work, she is fired from her waitressing job. In desperation, Eleanor goes to a temp agency for nannies, and as luck would have it, she is hired as the new live-in nanny for Reggie. As this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see how it all plays out. Couple of comments: this is the latest movie written and directed by actor Frank Whaley. This time he chooses to bring the story of an unlikely but blossoming friendship between Reggie and Eleanor. Reggie needs Eleanor just as much as she needs him, in fact she may need Reggie more, as she is down on her luck, with an annoying boyfriend, an ailing father and a strained relationship with the rest of her family. Beware: this movie is not for anyone in a hurry, and there is no major plot to speak of, so if you don't like a movie where there's lot of talking and little or no action, do yourself a favor and watch something else. It is a darn shame that this movie is rated \"R\" (the F word is used twice, and it wasn't even necessary and didn't make the movie any more \"authentic\"), as a key potential audience (the 14 to 17 yr. old) is probably not going to get to see this now. As to the acting performances, both leads (Leighton Meester as Elanor and Julian Shatkin as Reggie) give stellar performances and I hope we'll see more of them in due course. However, Billie Joe Armstrong (yes, he of Green Day) is completely miscast as Eleanor's boyfriend (for one, he is WAY too old, and for another, his acting skills are lacking). Also, there is a fair amount of classical music in the movie, so if that's not your thing, beware. I quite liked the classical segments, and the overall musical score, courtesy of Ed Hardcourt. Bottom line: not knowing much of anything about this movie before seeing it, I was pleasantly surprised by this and charmed from start to finish. This movie was shot in New York 2 years ago, and shown at various film festivals last year. Why it's taken this long to appear in the theaters, I have no idea. I recently saw this at the Silverspot Cinema in Naples, FL. The matinée screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great. If you are ready for something other than the usual \"Furious 7\" or \"Ant-Man\" fare that Hollywood is sending our way, this movie might just do the trick for you. \"Like Sunday, Like Rain\" is definitely worth checking out, be it in the theater or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",
         "This is such a beautiful simple movie , i loved every second of it and i really didn't want it to end. the casting is amazing that little boy is really talented and Leighton Messter is one of the best actresses out there. It's a must see movie. The movie will keep you absorbed and interested until the end even though it is really slow pased. It is also beautifully written the script was amazing it was like wise poetry in some way. this movie goes straight to my all time favourites and i will be rewatching it as soon as i can. the main soundtrack \"like Sunday like Rain\" is also amazing such beautiful sad music that goes perfectly with the kid's and the Nanny's current situation. absolutely beautiful.",
         "Julian Shatkin did quite well playing a preteen savant named Reggie, considering his age, but writer/director, Frank Whaley, let him down. The role would have been more believable had Whaley given him a wider emotional range (and, in my view, it's the director's job to coax the writer into writing each character equally well - funny that the director did not have that conversation with himself as the writer!). From the start of the movie, the boy's isolation is palpable as his mother plans to leave him on travels. (Debra Messing plays her well, but the part is limited and is only consequential in that it shows how emotionally deprived Reggie was.) He \"snaps\" at his friend at one point, as he put it, but compared to the frustrations of dealing with adults and children who rarely understand him or his choices, there was not enough emotion, particularly not enough anger. I feel his character loses a certain amount of aliveness because of it. In great contrast, Whaley was able to figure out Eleanor's (the nanny's) emotions, and Leighton Meester was in turn able to play those emotions brilliantly. After the movie ended, I attempted to flash back to moments where Leighton had not played her role authentically, and could not find any such moment. That's how great her acting is. The fierceness of her initial confrontation with her boyfriend was placed into context by our understanding of her family that followed. A beautiful young woman emerges from the initial mess, and we quickly find that she possesses advanced maternal instincts toward Reggie, supporting him exactly as he is, with all his awkward brilliance, even as he bends her to his wishes along the way. Her character is no pushover and she has her own plans, caring for her own soul as well. Overall, the film is well worth watching, as it will move you, and you may even understand what children need a bit better. They need love. Leighton Meester clearly has that love in her, and her performance is a credit both to her and to Whaley. Yes, both actress and writer/director got Eleanor exactly right.",
         "A movie with intelligent premise and dialog and with restrained acting stands out by itself these days. This one's unusual plot adds to the appeal, but the ending is a bit disappointing regarding the characters' development. Overall, the apparently unlikely emotional connection between the two main characters gets more and more believable over the film, and one wonders what would have become of them if the age gap was smaller and the circumstances were different. Or perhaps despite that, in the end all that counts is pure friendship, no matter our differences. A cynical would say this film had a romantic comedy formula: boy meets girl, boy falls for girl, they separate (and in the end they are back together if it's a comedy). Why did she have to leave? It was so romantic and gave way for intensely emotional scenes, but when you think about it, her leave is somewhat forced and not entirely justified. She could have moved in the city, gotten back into music and maintained their friendship. And in a few years could have gone cougar on him (crude joke alert!). Now seriously, a smart girl like her could have made a better choice, and a smart filmmaker who made this good film could have made a better editing towards the ending.",
         "A protagonist/antagonist tale of a precocious young man whose intelligence and wealth makes it easy to manipulate all about him for his own convenience (albeit mostly positive); butts heads with his new nanny who, of course, is polar opposite and predictably they both compromise (well one more than the other) to make a predictable but enjoyable journey. Casting and subsequent acting first rate. Dialogue appropriate to the roles was outstanding and naturalistically convincing. Ending, however, was not convincing or challenging. Nanny was in a situation where the resources would have opened many windows of opportunity, so her decision did not jibe with her situational intelligence. A more creative ending would have been a subway (or equivalent) playing duet possibly as a foothold to greater things. Additionally, the young man could have learned to use his skills to help his classmates and even the teacher, and later, others as well. The nanny also had the resources to be selfless and be a positive changer.",
         "A quiet meditation of a film...the music was especially moving. I liked the steady pace which left time for the viewer to absorb the emotions. The director was very skilled at helping the actors give sublime performances. I left the theater feeling lonely at abandoning the two main characters to their unknown future lives. I loved the scenes of New York City. The Spanish servants were also realistic. The only character I didn't like was the rocker boyfriend and it seemed like that story line got dropped like a lead weight. Debra Messing was over the top as well...unbelievably COLD and mercenary. I wish they had shown the a real quartet in the end...playing at Julliard.",
         "I came across this movie and my expectations were low. How good is a movie I've never heard of and that grossed $24 000? But I enjoyed it so much I gave it 9/10. It was intelligent and sparse. It was unusual and stylish. It was beautifully shot. Make no mistake - this is not a babysitter movie. It's a relationship movie. Featuring only two main characters and a few others to cement the different lives of our two key players, the understated tale of two such different cultures coming together was exceptionally interesting. The pace gives us sufficient time to enjoy some of the subtleties of this unusual relationship. There was a stretch in the way the boy character changed so suddenly, but it moved the story along. The music score was also very emotional. Make an effort to see this.",
         "Like Sunday, Like Rain, at first, focuses on the lives of two separate individuals in Brooklyn, one of whom, a twentysomething woman named Eleanor (Leighton Meester) who breaks up with her obnoxious, rock-star boyfriend (Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong) and moves in with her friend, and the other, a cynical, twelve-year-old prodigy named Reggie (Julian Shatkin), who, despite so young and full of talents, is skeptical of all aspects of life. Their paths cross when Eleanor's boyfriend costs her the only job she's ostensibly ever held down, a barista position at a local coffee shop, leading her to accept a job babysitting Reggie while his mother is out of town. Reggie is about as cynical as a sixty-five-year-old war veteran is about the current state of America and that's putting it mildly. Still largely treated like a child by his own mother and only finding temporary companionship in his maid, Reggie spends his days in his castle-of-a-home playing the cello, composing, or simply indulging in his own thoughts, all things he taught himself how to do. Reggie's misery doesn't stem from any one certain circumstance; he's adopted cynicism as the religion of his life, remaining skeptical of most people he meets in addition to writing things off immediately without trying anything new. Eleanor is the first soul in a long time to really resonate with him, mainly because she finds him interesting despite all the bottled up frustration he holds inside. Thankfully, Eleanor has the privilege of being played by Leighton Meester, a lovely and often overshadowed young actress in the face of similar actresses like Brie Larson and Rosemarie DeWitt. Meester's strengths here largely stem from her ability to be a natural screen presence, never asserting her character in a dramatic light, and Shatkin - in one of his first film roles - has the exquisite ability to perform long, sometimes complicated, monologues about his opinions that would even make a seasoned performer stumble over their words. The film was written and directed by Frank Whaley, a solid character actor and an even better director; this is his first film since the unseen and unfairly bashed New York City Serenade in 2007. This particular effort seems to catch Whaley in a more contemplative mood, one that features the complications and insights of the world being defined by a prepubescent teenager that feels he has figured the world out. With that in mind, one can tell this is less a realistic film and more a \"what if?\" kind of film. Reggie doesn't speak nor act like any twelve-year-old I believe to exist (maybe sixteen-year-old, but not a twelve-year-old), and it's hard to believe these kind of profound bouts of cynicism in life would begin earlier than high school or college. Yet, Whaley himself might even recognize that Reggie's cynicism is a bit premature for his age, and with that, might want us to focus more on the chemistry or the smooth flow of the dialog in the film. Consider the scene where Eleanor and Reggie lie on the grass, with Reggie doing something he probably doesn't do with people too often and that's open up about his true feelings towards Eleanor on a friend level. Whaley makes it so these scenes of chemistry and a young man coming to terms with how his attitude polarizes people make it so that the lack of dialog-realism doesn't become such a distraction. Like Sunday, Like Rain doesn't appear to have the kind of long-term effect Whaley's other films have, such as the somber effect I had for days upon seeing The Jimmy Show or the incorruptible cheerfulness I had upon seeing New York City Serenade. However, this reminds me that I'll never know exactly what Whaley will make next or how he'll approach his subject matter; he has now made four directorial efforts, each different from the last and all capable of producing different thoughts and emotions. It's hard enough to do that, let alone remain relevant for decades when you mostly have supporting character roles in films. Starring: Leighton Meester, Julian Shatkin, and Billie Joe Armstrong. Directed by: Frank Whaley."
