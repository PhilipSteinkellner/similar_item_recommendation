         "The subtle humor and delicate jokes scattered along the whole film are completed by the sublime performance of both Chiquito and Bigote Arrocet, very well known is Spain for his priceless appearances in \"Un, dos tres\" along with the beautiful \"La Bombi\" and incomparable \"Duo Sacapuntas\"... The special effects resemble to those used by George Lucas Grijander in his worldwide famous Star Wars series.... This poetic masterpiece is to be shown to future generations so that they learn the true meaning of life...",
         "After watching films like \"Speed 2\" and \"Lost Highway\" I conclude this is a very good film. If you don´t understand the intelligent humor perhaps all you need is reading books. One at least..",
         "I see this movie with a couple of friends and you maybe can laugh about it I repeat maybe It´s one of the worst movies ever done in all the spanish history you can´t say that it´s a comedy cause it isn´t, is a fistro de pelicula.",
         "With this his debut in the big screen Chiquito-San (like he likes to be called by his fellow citizens as showed in many interviews with reporters such as Peticano Gramore and Notedi Gotrigo), blow us away with a performance never seen before in Spanish cinematography. Or anywhere else. In Barbate, perhaps. Set in a very realistic Wild West full of Hombre Malo de la Pradera, we will be amazed with its delightful special effects, from the well known Spanish artist Grijano Candenauer. Pay particular attention to the thrilling run for their lives when the buffaloes attack, it couldn't be more realistic. This scene also delivers one of the most exquisite sentences ever spoken in Cervantes' language (translated here): -\"Senior Conde, don't let them smell your fear\". -\"That's going to be difficult Lucas, I did caquitaaarl!\". What a mastery of the languaje, Cervantes himself would be proud and amused at such intelligent and high use of his Castellano. It's a pity that people from other countries cannot fully enjoy this movie without a completely and deep knowledge of the Spanish vocabulary and grammar, especially from the jargon known as \"Chiquitistani de los Dolores\", for it is necessary to have the highest wisdom of all its idiomatic features and tricks to be able to fully comprehend the incredible experience that Chiquito de la Calzada Gromenauer treats his fans with. Like he would say himself: \"E candemore nain, quietorl, cobarde!\". Jarl.",
         "If you want to watch the same joke during 1 hour and a half, this is your movie. The worst visual effects I ever seen, and the worst actors. Don't lose the eclipse, and the buffalos, they are pretty. Chiquito de la Calzada is the new hero of the world"
