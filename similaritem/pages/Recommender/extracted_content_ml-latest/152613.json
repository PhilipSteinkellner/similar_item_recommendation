         "The worst thing you can do with a French comedy is try to take it seriously. Pomposity gets you nowhere. Suspend disbelief, tuck your tongue firmly in your cheek and go along for the ride! I've seen my share of outstandingly bad French comedy, just as there are bad British or American comedies out there. But this one, drawn from a comic of the same title, made me laugh out loud repeatedly on what had started as a very bad day (not to mention the night before). Part of the fun was seeing so many French actors I recognised from other films, comic as well as serious: Isabelle Nanty is hysterical as the English teacher (when did she work at my school?), Arnaud Ducret of \"Parents: Mode D'Emploi\" fame had me in stitches as the gym teacher (I swear I've had that guy in my class!) and who would have thought Phillipe Duclos, the \"bad guy\" from Spirale, could be so funny as the hapless principal? Yes, it is silly. Yes, the ending is a bit \"out there\" (but no more so than say, \"9 to 5\"). I can cite more than a dozen or so big \"comedy blockbusters\" from American studios that didn't make me laugh once. Watching this film was like porking out on chocolate chip cookies and junk food; I wouldn't want to do it every day, but today it was just what I needed.",
         "I wanted to watch some good euro-comedy but couldn't find anything and then I stumbled upon Les Profs. It is almost everything I love about French comedies - witty, with awesome characters. It is a story about the school that is about to be closed because every year the students fail to pass the state exam. To save the school a new group of teachers is hired. But they are not your usual teachers - it's the worst teachers they could found. And every one of them has it's own methods of teaching. And wait till you see it! Of course there will be some romance involved as well as some twists in the plot. The end is rather predictable but this is not kinda movie you watch to know how it ends but to enjoy it while it lasts. It also reminded me about another french comedy -The Under-Gifted(1980) (Les sous-doués) but kinda vice versa because here the teachers do the pranks =) All in all - it is an excellent french comedy and if you want to spend nice evening with the company of french teens and crazy teachers - this one is for you. Enjoy!",
         "With such a deep cast and a potentially quite comical premise, one could have expected something better than this pseudo comedy where nothing works. The movie boils down to a completely disjointed succession of uninteresting scenes, often badly filmed, where the humor is off and where almost all the gags fall flat. The actors try to keep the movie afloat, though their performance are quite uneven: Isabelle Nanty for example is particularly good while Kev Adams is just plain bad. But, overall, how can you blame them when the script and the mise-en-scène are so weak ? With Les Profs, the French cinematographic creation hits rock bottom...",
         "This film had the potential, the idea was good, the budget is there, the actors are there, all you need is a good script, but no, I forced myself to laugh, but the closest I could get is cringes. My friend highly recommended this one for me, and since I don't understand French, I got it English-subbed. But it wasn't worth all the trouble. This has a second part, which I am pretty sure won't even consider. 3/10, to recycle bin.",
         "I recently. Saw \"les profs\" by Pierre-François Martin Laval it is a comedy Film, film which was produced by Les films Du 24 / TF1 films production in 2013 and cast ed 88min This movies is set in Paris 2013 .it tells story Boulard , played by Kev Adams .The story begins when the high school Jules-Ferry shows only 12% success in the baccalaureate , making the worst high school of France. I personally think it's , this a beautiful film, I would recommend it because it is so funny",
         "It is the story of the worst high-school of France with the worst teachers in the world. the film began on graduation day when they discover that the Jules Ferry high-school has beaten the worst A Level score. When the Education Minister got the news, he decided to call \"the worst teachers for worst students\". After all, every film has plus points and negative points. This one give us an exaggerated vision of the behavior of the teachers but whatever happens, it is a very enjoyable comedy film who has a far- fetched screenplay and so funny scenes that you will have tears in your eyes. So, it is a must-see movie!"
