         "This film, while not particularly inspired, does a very good job with the story of two boys who are trying to train a bird dog. There is a nasty neighbor and a few other plot developments that throw a hitch in their plans, but the film is quietly solid all the way. It might be a little too laid back for the kids of today, but in 1972 teenagers were more tolerant. The cast is part of the reason the film works. Johnny Whitaker, looking not much older than his days on Family Affair, and George Spell were completely convincing as friends. The wonderful Beah Richards also helps the film along as George's mother. Earl Holliman and Pat Crowley are Johnny's parents, and Holliman always could be counted on to give a great performance. It's just a small film that shines quietly.",
         "There is a story in my family that this story actually began with a dog that belonged to my grandfather,in Gainsville,Georgia.....with Grandpa's dog, the story was that he had wanted to get into hunting, and got two dogs,one an Irish setter, the other some kind of pointer. The setter was dumb as a brick, and wound up just a pet, but the pointer was too bloody smart, and though it was obvious it knew what was wanted, it would play dumb like the setter, so that it wouldn't have to work. So the dog would just hang out under the back porch, waiting for the leftovers, and beat the setter almost every time the biscuits were tossed to the dogs,hence the name. It wasn't an insult, just a comment on the dog's tricks. Grandpa knew the dog was a hunter, because he had seen the dog working before he bought it, and would see it point and flush when it was out in the fields on its own. He didn't have the patience to train,and apparently just got a kick from the dog's intelligence, and liked to tell the story to cronies. He said that Disney heard the story (this part I don't remember), and stole the idea. He tried to sue, but didn't get anywhere."
