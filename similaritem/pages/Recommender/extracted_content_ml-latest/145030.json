         "content": "> When the mountain swallowed the 33 men alive...\r\n\r\nThis is one of the greatest movie of 2015, not because of twists and turns, but pleasingly illustrating a true disastrous event. So don't listen to the negative remarks about it, ignore the low scores and just see it already. Like any flick, it definitely had a few flaws, if you focus it properly, you won't be distracted for those faults in the movie. All the above, bringing that 2010's unfortunate mining tragedy on screen was a success, that's the very important.\r\n\r\nIt was not a Marvel's superhero movie or a Disney-Pixar's cute animation that has its own large fan base to support. It is not even a Hollywood, but English language movie from Chile. So that's where the critics steered common people in a wrong direction. But as I'm a movie fanatic, I totally recommend it for all. This was not a simple disaster drama, but had a good amount of emotions, suspense, nationalism, light laughs, brotherhood and ultimately a good entertainment.\r\n\r\nIt is no ones biopic as it was categorised. It is a single real incident based movie, especially the book 'Deep Down Dark'. All the characters had a fair scope and portrayed according to story growth. But it opened by introducing only a few main characters and other supporting ones out of 33 whose story this was based on.\r\n\r\nOn an ordinary day, those miners started their day as usual. For some, it was their first day and for others it was the final days of their job, but everyone had their own reasons to go into the mountain's deep down. But what they did not know was the mountain was tired of being opened its mouth for the centuries. Finally, she decided to close the mouth by swallowing the 33. But those men stood against the chances they had and fought for their survival, which was finely told in this movie. What happened to them, how it concludes was narrated still the last minute with suspense.\r\n\r\n> \"That's not a rock, that's the heart of the mountain.\r\n> She finally broke.\"\r\n\r\nTo me there was no mystery left in the main theme, because when this thing happened 5 years ago, I closely followed the event. So I know how it ended and I knew how the movie would end, but surprising parts were the families, media, politics and all the other surrounding events composed together which was a quite fresh perspective that helped the movie to help shape well. So I am telling you, if you think you know this story, you probably wrong on that assumption.\r\n\r\nIf I want to discuss about negative, that would the language of the movie. I am very-very disappointed with that choice, it must have been in the Spanish. Those Chilean characters speaking English was kind of jokes with their funny accent. It did not work for me, because Chile never was a commonwealth member. If Indian, Malaysian or Sri Lankan character speaks English would make sense. I know they wanted it to be an International product, so did they chose Internationally recognisable actors like Antonio Banderas and Julliette Binoche. Yes, on that aspect it paid off well.\r\n\r\nThe movie almost got me on its emotional side, I did not show it physically, but surely I felt deep inside me. It also triumphs to tell how important the families are. They are the first ones to react if you are in a real danger to rescue, to shed tears, to standby on the scene looking for your return and to hug tightly. The movie might be categorised in a couple of genres, but it had other mixed ingredients as well. For example, the scenes called the last supper and the circus outside the rescue site. Movies are not all about perfection, sometimes demonstrating its purpose decently would do good enough. So on that facet I got no point to say to skip it.\r\n\r\n9/10",

Mario (Antonio Banderas) takes extra shifts to support his wife Katty and his daughter Escarlette. Álex (Mario Casas) considers taking a much safer job despite that it may pay much less to ease the mind of his pregnant wife Jessica and his father Don José. Darío (Juan Pablo Raba) would rather sleep on park benches than accept the charity of his estranged sister María (Juliette Binoche). Yonni (Oscar Nunez) entertains his fellow miners with his romantic escapades, while Edison (Jacob Vargas) dresses and behaves like an Elvis impersonator. José (Marco Trevino) doubles as a pastor for the men when they head below ground; shift foreman Luis (Lou Diamond Phillips) has growing concerns about the safety of the San José mine. Gomex (Gustavo Angarita), the crews oldest member, will retire in two weeks. August 5, 2010. Day 1. Mario, Álex, Darío, Yonni, Edison, José, Gomex, Luis, and other men board a shuttle bus to the San José mine. While driving through the desert, they pass Carlos (Tenoch Huerta), a Bolivian transplant walking to his first shift at the mine. The bus does not stop to pick him up. Before their shift begins, Luis storms into his boss Castillo's office. While inspecting the stability of the tunnels below ground, he discovered a shard of glass. Luis explains that mirrors were placed between the fissures of the mountain; some of the mirrors have broken, which means the mountain shifted. Luis, concerned about the safety of his men, thinks the mine should be shut down. Castillo disagrees and sends Luis away. Outside, Edison berates Carlos because he comes from Bolivia, where men dig tin but not gold. Everyone climbs aboard a truck, which drives them into the mine through its only entrance and exit: a narrow tunnel. Carlos quickly becomes claustrophobic. The Machine Shop. Dig site. 1,700 feet below ground. 90°F. The men set to work. Luis continues to inspect the tunnels and finds more shards of glass. Mario shows Carlos how to operate an excavator. Álex asks Darío if he should take the lower paying job; Darío is hungover and doesnt care. Without warning, the ground begins to shake. Giant boulders rain down upon the miners. Everyone runs to the trucks and drive like mad for the Refuge (dig site, 2,300 feet below ground, 94°F), a place built for miners to wait during a cave in. Tunnels collapse, the trucks careen into giant boulders, and the men are thrown every which way. Above ground, the entrance to the mine gives way in a puff of smoke. All in all, thirty-three workers have been trapped underground. Above ground, Castillo shuts down the mine site and tries to prevent anyone from leaving. Two miners manage to drive away before Castillo bars the gates; the men call newscasters to report the collapse. The families of the men trapped underground rush to the gates of the San José mine and demand answers. At the presidential palace in the capital city of Santiago, the minister of mining Laurence Golborne (Rodrigo Santoro) tells President Pinera (Bob Gunton) that the mining company cannot handle the rescue expedition. Despite being new to his job, Lauren convinces the president to intervene. Underground, the miners gather and assess their options. A staggeringly large boulder blocks them off from the roads leading out of the mine. Luis wants the men to go to the Refuge, where there is enough food and water to last thirty men for three days. Mario will not give up so easily. He wants to inspect the ladders that extend up the mines chimneys: if the chimneys have not been blocked, they can all climb out. Álex offers to join him. Luis fails to stop them. Day 2. Below ground, Mario and Álex climb the ladders. They quickly discover that the ladders stop halfway up the chimney. Their employers never bothered to finish them. Luis discovers that the communication radios installed in the Refuge were never finished. Darío attacks Yonni to get access to the food rations. The men discover eighteen cans of tuna, a few packets of cookies, and some milk cartons. Mario confronts Luis, who knew the ladders were never finished. Luis has given up hope: it took a century for the miners to dig this deep, and the company that owns the mine will never pay for their rescue. He believes they will die underground. Mario and Luis almost come to blows, but when Darío begins to eat the rations, a riot erupts. Mario calms the other men down and earns their respect: they put him in charge of the rations. Above ground, Laurence arrives at the mine site. María confronts him and will not let him pass until he has sworn he will save the men trapped in the mine. Castillo tells Laurence he tried to send a team of rescuers down a chimney but that it collapsed. Its too dangerous to attempt another rescue. When Laurence delivers the news to the miners families, María attacks him for failing them. President Pinera calls upon André Sougarret, a well-respected mining engineer. André tells Laurence that, even if they began digging immediately, it would take about eight days to reach the trapped men. To complicate matters, the rockbed could cause the drills to veer away from the Refuge. Reaching the men will be a challenge, and they dont have any time to spare. Day 3. Below ground, Mario distributes meager rations. The men manage to restore the Refuges lights, which raises their spirits. When they hear the drills and realize they will be rescued, their moods rise. Day 5. The drills have been working nonstop but break frequently because of the incredibly hard rock of the mountain. André becomes impatient with Laurence when the other man asks him too many questions. The families of the miners have set up camp outside of the mine site. Laurence, unable to answer whether the trapped men are still alive, feels helpless when he addresses them. He organizes a camp that will provide shelter, food, medical attention, and schooling for the rescuers and the families of the trapped miners. María finds Laurence and thanks him for keeping his promise. Below ground, Darío struggles through withdrawal. José comforts and prays with him. Day 8. Camp Hope is up and running. Katty and Escarlette cook food; Jessica teaches the children of the miners; Yonnis wife and mistress come to blows over who will be the one to greet him. Day 14. A drill finally reaches the depth of the Refuge. Above ground, Laurence and André and the miners families wait anxiously for the machinery to break through the rock. Below ground, the men hear the drills approach and rejoice. Their celebration ends abruptly, when they realize the drill has bypassed the Refuge. Álex breaks down and runs to a ledge within the cavern. Mario convinces him not to jump by reminding him of his responsibilities as a father. Days pass, and hope dwindles. The miners eat the last of their rations and imagine it is a feast attended by their loved ones. Above ground, André tells Laurence that the men are probably dead. He's giving up. Laurence is furious, but after talking with María, he has an idea: based on their past miscalculations, they should direct the drills along the fissures in the rock. When he explains his plan to André, the engineer realizes its brilliant. Day 17. Mario walks through the Refuge and sees how badly the men are doing. Álex is talking to himself. José has difficulty breathing. Carlos seems lost in his own mind. To his astonishment, one of the drills breaks through the cavern ceiling. Mario calls the other men, and they bang upon the drill. Aboveground, Laurence hears the noise. The miners attach a note to the drill, which President Pinera reads to the miners families: all thirty-three men are alive. Everyone rejoices. Even Yonni's wife and mistress embrace. André tells Laurence that extracting the men still presents a challenge: nothing like this has been attempted before. More days pass. The rescue team lowers a camera into the Refuge, allowing the men to communicate with the world above. Now that they've found the men, they can send them food and more: iPods, magazines, new clothes. The men's health improves, but they grow tired of living in close quarters. Mario quickly becomes the face of the miners, and they resent his rise to fame -- especially when Yonni reads in a paper that Super Mario has been offered a book deal. Mario does not respond to his friends criticisms well and takes credit for keeping them alive. Edison leads a coup and ousts Mario from power. Above ground, the president is furious that the drills keep breaking, delaying the miners rescue. Below ground, Darío finds Mario. He confesses he doesn't know what to say to María once they're rescued: she abandoned their family, and him, when he was young. Mario tells him to forgive María and pray to god she forgives him. Edison awakens and believes Carlos has stolen his iPod. When he tries to beat Carlos, Carlos pulls a knife on him. Mario breaks up their fight and apologizes for letting his fame get to his head. All of the men, including Edison and Carlos, embrace Mario and welcome him back into the fold. Day 58. Luis hears the drills approach and realizes it will hit an iron support beam if it continues on its current path. Hitting the beam will break the drill and delay their rescue again. The miners tell Laurence and André that they will have to use a controlled explosion to take out the iron beam underground. They're willing to assume that risk. Above ground, the families know the men will be rescued soon. Jessica goes into labor but refuses to leave the mine site. Yonni's wife decides to leave him (and Camp Hope) while his mistress is invited to the extraction site by María. An extraction capsule will carry the miners out one by one. Laurence and André tells the miners that, due to the mountains instability, there is not enough time to enforce the shaft that the capsule will travel. If anything happens as the capsule goes down and up, then it might be impossible to get the miners out. The first man will be in the most danger but might also be the only man to get out. October 13, 2010. The extraction capsule reaches the Refuge. Álex is chosen to be the first one taken out. He tells his friends he will see them above ground. The extraction goes off without a hitch, and Álex emerges from the capsule to find his father, Jessica, and their newborn daughter waiting for him. The rest of the men emerge one-by-one. Mario whips the crowd into a frenzy. Edison and Yonni strikes poses. President Pinera embraces Laurence and congratulates him. Darío and Mario hug each other. Luis is the last man to be taken up, and the film ends as he steps into the capsule. The San José Mining Company was found not guilty of criminal negligence, and the miners were never compensated. Nonetheless, they remain brothers to this day.",

         "We all remember five years ago when the story of 33 miners trapped 700 meters underground caught the world by storm. Everyone was asking: Are they alive? How are they going to make it out of there?. I think there's no need to say how it ended. Since then we've gotten tons of news announcing a big budget film about San José's rescue. The thing everyone's asking right know is: Is it any good? First things first: Patricia Riggen. Her direction is absolutely brilliant, managing to alternate between tense and emotional scenes almost perfectly. The acting as well is outstanding, with Antonio Banderas (Mario Sepúlveda) and Rodrigo Santoro (Laurence Golborne) being the most notable. Also, Cote De Pablo (Jessica Salgado) brings a big emotional push into the movie with a beautiful interpretation of \"Gracias a la Vida\" by Violeta Parra. Juliette Binoche (María Segovia) was also very good. In general, every actor and actress in this movie gave a solid performance. The screenplay is very well written, giving the characters a lot of development and personality. The soundtrack (Composed by James Horner) is also very good, mixing chilean instruments with big orchestra compositions that fit the movie perfectly. The CGI is OK, nothing groundbreaking, but it gets the job done. It's not a faultless film though, it has it's flaws. The are times when the movie loses it's pace and gets slow. Also, the editing, being mostly very good, it's evident that there where scenes in the movie that were cut from the final product, an issue that can leave some viewers confused. There's a little bit of shaky cam as well, not a big complain, but it can get very disorienting at times. Overall, even if it's not perfect, it's still a great movie that succeeds at telling the story of the 33 miners. Hopeful and inspiring, it's worth watching at least once. 8.4/10",
         "Based on the true story of 33 miners who go into a mine in Chile to have a big rock get in-between them and the surface, and they have to survive long enough to be rescued. I thought the movie was very detailed and complete about what the miners and their families went through during this ordeal. I never felt I missed any part of it. It was never boring, always interesting, which I did not expect, but a lot went on in those three mouths and it was captured wonderfully on the screen. Antonio Banderas was great as Mario, who kept the men together long enough to survive. And even though I knew the outcome, the 33 makes you feel for each character, which allows suspense. Well done and heartwarming, hitting on the rights spots and leaving me all filled up inside.",
         "Mining is a dangerous business. Going deep underground to dig minerals out of the earth means subjecting yourself to extreme heat, back-breaking work and the inhalation of dust that can lead to the pulmonary disease of silicosis. If none of these kill you slowly, the mine itself can kill you quickly and without warning. Miners die from accidents caused by their equipment, gas leaks and explosions and, of course, sudden collapses of the rock surrounding them. All told, this difficult work kills thousands of miners every year (as many as 12,000 by one count). These facts and statistics are brought to life in the true story of the 2010 Chilean copper-gold mine collapse portrayed in the drama \"The 33\" (PG-13, 2:07). The film opens with a retirement party for one miner who is about to complete 45 years of service to the private company that owns and operates the San José mine near Copiapó, Chile. Several of his long-time co-workers are at the party with their families. Their is shift foreman Luis \"Don Lucho\" Urzúa (Lou Diamond Phillips), experienced miner and natural leader Mario Sepúlveda (Antonio Banderas), father-to-be Álex Vega (Mario Casas) and Elvis Presley-loving miner Edison Peña (Jacob Vargas), among others. On the morning of August 5, 2010, these men took the long and winding truck ride three miles into the mine, completely unaware that they were about to become victims of one of the worst mining disasters in Chile's history. Luis saw it coming, but the safety concerns that he expressed to the mine's manager went unheeded. That afternoon, a rock the height of the Empire State Building and the width of two of them fell into the mine, trapping 33 men inside. Seeing the devastating cave-in and its effects on the men and their surroundings, it seems like a miracle that none of the 33 died in the initial collapse. Although some would say that the real miracle would be if no one died in mining accidents, or at least if this collapse had occurred during off-duty hours, rather than the miners having to get trapped and suffer, while their families waited in agony for news about the fate of their loved ones. It was those families who became the impetus for a full-on rescue attempt. Although Chile's President (Bob Gunton) is reluctant to get his government involved with an accident at a privately-owned mine, his new Minister of Mining, Laurence Golborne (Rodrigo Santoro) convinces President Piñera to let him go to the site and see what he can do. The families, led by María Segovia (Juliette Binoche), the estranged sister of trapped miner Darío Segovia (Juan Pablo Raba), had gathered outside the locked gates of the mining complex. These siblings, wives, mothers, fathers and friends demanded action, and action they got. In spite of the prevailing opinion that the miners were probably dead or would die long before they could be rescued, Minister Golborne brings in heavy-duty drills and works with renowned mining expert André Sougarret (Gabriel Byrne) to try and reach the miners before it's too late. Meanwhile, the miners ration food and try to keep each other's spirits up, even as several of them fight and suffer from various medical conditions, as hope fades that they will ever see their families again. \"The 33\" is exceptional. Based on the book \"Deep Down Dark\" by Héctor Tobar, the film version takes few liberties with the facts and fashions a very compelling narrative. The screenplay succinctly, but effectively sets the stage and develops its characters \u2013 both above and below ground. We feel the desperation of both the miners and their families. As the miners' story unfolds, concurrently with that of their families and those attempting to rescue them, Patricia Riggens directs with great pacing (which is helped by nearly perfect editing). She also gets great performances from her cast and blends the talents and experience of well-known and little-known actors wonderfully. Although the movie did drag a little as it neared its dramatic conclusion, this is a film which tells its story with drama, sensitivity and even some humor and makes it relatable to anyone who ever came to the aid of someone in trouble. \"A\"",
         "\"That's not a rock, that's the heart of the mountain. She finally broke.\" Five years ago the eyes of the entire South American population were placed on a relatively unknown small mining town in Chile. When the San Jose mine collapsed in Copiapo, 33 miners were trapped under more than 2000 feet, and the news travelled fast. It isn't uncommon to hear about these tragic mining accidents, but what stood out here was that the family members never lost hope and established camp near the site to force authorities to not give up and continue the rescue efforts. After two and a half weeks of uncertainty and against all odds, the rescuers managed to contact the refuge in the mine where all 33 miners reported to be alive and well. That was just the beginning of a long and exhaustive rescue effort that would last more than two months, and that every media channel covered 24 hours a day. The story is recent and we all saw it take place live on our TV sets, so the real question I had for Patricia Riggen's film was whether or not she could make this captivating enough to hold our interest despite the familiarity of the story. Surprisingly she succeeded. The film is deeply flawed and for commercial purposes it had an international cast that spoke in English with a forced Chilean accent. I hate movies that do this (if you want to tell the story in English then just have the actors speak in plain English; you're not more convincing because you do it with an accent), but despite that pet peeve of mine, the film managed to draw me in emotionally and I found it to be a beautiful and honest tribute. I can understand those who criticize the movie because it isn't perfect, but there were several emotional scenes where I literally had goose bumps all over my arms, and that is always an indicator for me that the movie is accomplishing its purpose. One of the main characters in this film, the miner who kept the group together under those critical conditions, was Mario Sepulveda (Antonio Banderas). He never lost hope and promised the rest of his friends that he would keep them alive. His wife, Escarlette (Naomi Scott), was one of the supporters who decided to set camp outside the site to force authorities to continue their rescue efforts. The other main supporter was Maria Segovia (Juliette Binoche) who refused to believe that her brother, Dario (Juan Pablo Raba) was dead. Along with other family members and with the help of the media they put pressure on the government to save their lives. The Mining Minister, Laurence Golborne (Rodrigo Santoro), and mining expert, Andre Sougarret (Gabriel Byrne), were given the difficult task to come up with a plan to rescue these miners who were buried deep underground. Meanwhile under the heart of the mountain, Mario was in charge of keeping the group spirit alive and avoiding they end up driving each other crazy due to the lack of food and water. He lifted Alex's (Mario Casas) spirit when he was falling into despair reminding him that his pregnant wife Jessica (Cote de Pablo) was waiting for him, he also protected the only Bolivian in the crew, Carlos Mamani (Tenoch Huerta), who was pushed aside by everyone else for being a foreigner, and he also encouraged Don Lucho (Lou Diamond Phillips), who felt had failed the team because he knew the security conditions were bad. Rigged delivers both sides of the story: the 33 miners struggling to survive from the inside and the family members and the rescue team fighting to save them from the outside. I wasn't really into the film during its first thirty minutes because I was upset the characters were speaking in English with Spanish accents (to make matters worse there is a scene where a famous Chilean TV star named Don Francisco shows up and gives a report in Spanish), but midway into the movie the emotional drama picks up. There is a superb scene in which the miners are imagining eating their last supper together, and it was one of the most touching scenes I've seen this year. The visual effects weren't mesmerizing, but the collapse of the mine is believable. It takes a while to get used to the dark cinematography inside the mines where you can't tell most of the characters apart from each other. I'd say there are only about five miners who you can recall from the film, the rest are just there and are given no personality whatsoever. Those are some of my minor complaints for this film, but other than that the material was handled respectfully and James Horner's final musical composition helps build the emotional moments. Another memorable moment was when Cote de Pablo sings a beautiful song, Gracias a la Vida, while the families are awaiting for any news from the rescue team. Antonio Banderas delivers a great performance as Mario and he is one of the reasons why the dramatic moments worked so well. Despite knowing the story, it was still exciting and emotional to experience it in this flawed but touching film. There is also a funny and recurring gag on one of the miners (Oscar Nuñez) who had his wife and lover waiting for him in the camp. The film might not be entirely accurate, but it is still a well made film and a decent tribute. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",
         "I just saw this at Twin Cities Film Fest this weekend. The 33 chronicled the event that gripped the international community when 33 Chilean miners were buried under 100- year-old gold and copper mine and trapped for 69 days. Director Patricia Riggen did a phenomenal job telling a compelling story of human resilience and the courage of both the miners and their families above ground who refused to give up. Great ensemble cast featuring Antonio Banderas, Juliette Binoche, Lou Diamond Philips, Rodrigo Santoro, and Gabriel Byrne. It was exquisitely shot by Checco Varese, which was shot on location in two different mines in Bolivia, Colombia. It certainly looked authentic as the environment of the set made the actors felt as if they were real miners for a while. The 33 miners were also consulted for the film. There were moments that might have felt too 'Hollywoodized' but overall the film didn't feel emotionally manipulated. The genuinely stirring score came from the late James Horner, which the film paid tribute in the end. It's not a perfect film but I think the film was respectful to the subject matter and did the story and those miners justice. \u2013 read more new releases reviews on FlixChatter.net",
         "Greetings again from the darkness. How do you structure a film based on a true story that lasted 69 days, occurred 5 years ago, and was followed live on TV by half of the global population? Director Patricia Riggen (Girl in Progress, 2012) delivers a film designed to tug on heartstrings, and is based on the book \"Deep Down Dark\" from Hector Tobar, as well as interviews with the key players. In 2010, the San Jose copper/gold mine collapsed trapping 33 miners more than 2300 feet under tons of rubble and an unstable rock that dwarfed the Empire State Building. Through some pretty solid special effects, we are there for the collapse. It's this segment and the immediate reactions from the miners that provide the film's best segment. We feel the miner's sense of panic and doom as they begin to come to grips with their plight. The film rotates between three struggles: the isolation of the miners struggling to survive, the tent city populated by their families struggling to maintain hope, and the Chilean government struggling with the politics and public relations of a rescue mission. From a character standpoint, each of these three segments is given a face. Antonio Banderas as Mario becomes the focal point of the miners. He searches for an escape route, takes charge of the (very limited) food rations, and acts as referee and light of hope in an extremely volatile situation. Juliette Binoche (yes the French actress) is Maria, the sister of one of the trapped miners and the most assertive of those pushing the government to attempt a rescue. Rodrigo Santoro plays Laurence Goldborne, Chile's Minister of Mining, and the one who pushes the government to move forward with the costly rescue mission. Other key characters include Bob Gunton as Chile's President Pinera, Lou Diamond Phillips as \"Don Lucho\", the safety inspector, Gabriel Byrne as the chief engineer, James Brolin as Jeff Hart (leading the U.S. drilling team), Naomi Scott as Mario's wife, and three of the other miners: Oscar Nunez, Mario Casas, and Juan Pablo Raba. The most bizarre segment comes courtesy of miner hallucinations. It's a fantasy-infused Last Supper sequence that plays out to the sounds of a Bellini opera, while the food and drink flow and the family members join in the joy. It's not difficult to imagine the brain taking these poor gentlemen to such places of mental torture. As if the approach is to make the most viewer-friendly buried miner film possible, we aren't witness to much underground conflict, and the internal bickering within the Chilean government officials is kept to a minimum. We do get to see the media circus that occurred during the ordeal \u0085 of course, most of us witnessed it in real time. Director Riggen has delivered a film that taps into the multitude of emotions for the different groups of people, rather than concentrating on the miserable situation of the miners. It's a challenge to keep us interested in a true story of which we all know the ending, but most viewers will stay engaged with the characters. It should also be noted that the minimalistic score is some of the last work from the late, great James Horner.",
         "With its empowering story, visuals and acting, this film brings another true survival story to life. A group of thirty three gold miners go to work in the underlying mountains of Chile when their lives quickly turn upside down. Stranded by the collapse of the rocks, the men are forced to work together, struggle for food, stay optimistic despite their life threatening condition. With every second so crucial, the intensity of the film leaves the audience on the edge of their seats. Watching this film made me feel the pain of the miners, the anxiety of the families and the stress of the rescue team. I could personally feel the struggle from every side of the story. This is an amazing aspect of the film, especially because it is based on a true story. What better way to gain awareness than to make individuals feel the experience for themselves. I felt like throwing up throughout the whole movie and that just shows how amazingly the filmmakers depicted this horrifyingly true story of the innocent men who were stranded and their struggle to survive. The filmmakers have created a film that makes the audience feel as though they are experiencing the struggle rather than just watching it. I felt as if I was starving and becoming dehydrated just by watching. It's what makes the movie feel so real. The persuasive acting contributes to the empowering movie, especially Antonio Banderas whose performance as the leader, Mario was so believable. It's a role completely different from what he usually plays and he made me believe he was a Chilean miner. Usually films based on tragic events feel depressing but this film feels empowering and comedic in certain scenes. I enjoyed that. The film didn't make the best impression at first but, it became very engaging and strong towards the end. I give a lot of credit to its great ending because, in my opinion, an ending can really make or break a movie. I give the movie four out of five stars and recommend it for people between the ages of 13 and 18. Adults will enjoy it as well. Reviewed by Harmony M., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, age 16",
         "For sixty-nine days in the summer and autumn of 2010, the world was transfixed by a human-interest story like few others in history. It involved the plight of thirty-three mineworkers trapped inside an unstable mountain mine in the Atacama Desert in the southern part of Chile. During what appeared to be a routine mining operation some two thousand feet below the desert surface on August 5, 2010, the mountain started shifting very violently, trapping these workers in a shelter, blocked by a mass of rock twice the size of New York's Empire State Building. With three days worth of rations, the miners managed to survive an extra two weeks before massive drills managed to reach them with additional supplies. But during that time, it was necessary to engage in a very careful rescue operation that took an additional seven and a half weeks; and it involved a great deal of risk. Utilizing a Phoenix rescue capsule designed in the U.S., the multi-national rescue operation resulted in all thirty-three men coming out of there alive on October 13th, some in very bad shape, but all in one piece, physically anyway. This is the story told in the 2015 movie THE 33. Well directed by Patricia Riggen, a Mexican-born female director whose credits include 2007's UNDER THE SAME MOON, THE 33 stars Antonio Banderas and Lou Diamond Phillips as the principal leaders of the miners who find themselves trapped in that mountain, literally between a rock and a hard place, and a Chilean mining company and government that seem unwilling to believe that any of them are alive. The claustrophobic nature of the saga is very well depicted by Riggen, and give the added gravitas by the largely Latin American cast that portray the miners, including Banderas and Phillips. A fair amount of this film was made on location not far from the actual mine itself, in Copiapo, Chile; and the remoteness is photographed with the utmost stark reality imaginable. Riggen also depicts the kind of international media attention that the story got, and how the families and wives of the miners, including Juliette Binoche, who portrays the wife of miner Dario Segovia, played in the film by Juan Pablo Rada, angrily pressed the case for the Chilean government to do more, even to the point of asking for help from outside sources, including an American mining and drilling expert portrayed by James Brolin. Gabriel Byrne and Rodrigo Santoro portray the government officials charged with finding a way of drilling down to the miners without making the mountain even more unstable than it already is, and thus guaranteeing a cave-in that would make rescue impossible. While it may be easy to portray the Chilean mine disaster depicted in THE 33 as an example of corporate malfeasance that had nearly fatal results, that socio-political aspect is not really discussed in the film, although when the end credits (featuring the real life miners) roll, the end title card indicates that the mining company never compensated the miners for their nearly ten weeks of psychological and spiritual horror (in essence, they got the Shaft, so to speak). The film, however, does go to great lengths to depict the aforementioned psychological and spiritual horror they went through, including a subtle hint that, unless food was sent down to them, they might resort to cannibalism if any of them died off in that hellhole, where temperatures reached 100 degrees Fahrenheit the entire time. Even without this hint, though, the film that THE 33 most closely resembles is 1993's ALIVE, which depicted the survivors of the 1972 Andean plane crash whose survival did partially depend on cannibalism; it also resembles the equally compelling true-life 1995 space saga APOLLO 13. Another aspect well depicted is how transfixed the international media, including every news outlet in the United States, covered this story in a way that, given how tabloid-focused it had become by then, was largely tasteful, though also suitably dramatic. The whole enterprise is topped off by an appropriate, somber, and Andean-flavored score by James Horner, which turned out to be one of the last film scores he worked on before he perished in a plane crash in Ventura County, California on June 22, 2015. Despite the fairly leisurely pace (some would, mistakenly in my opinion, call it slow), THE 33, like ALIVE and APOLLO 13, is done in the right way, avoiding spectacle most of the time, using CGI only when necessary, and steering clear of sensationalism. As such, it will likely count as one of the best movies of 2015.",
         "I understand there are limits and parameters to telling a story such as this -- one we all remember. But why would the producers/writers not include the heroics of the paramedics and navy seals who *went down first* to secure the 33's health. That is a story onto itself. And they're completely left out? I enjoyed the film until that part at the end, asking myself, WTF? A complete omission and slap in the face of men who put themselves in harm's way. It doesn't make sense not to include a couple of minutes of their work in the film.",
         "\"That's not a rock. That's the heart of the mountain. She finally broke.\" August 5, 2010 started out like any other day. Mario (Banderas) and 32 other miners headed down in a mountain looking for gold. While they are underground the unthinkable happens. Now, with only enough food and water for 30 people for 3 days the 33 trapped miners must ban together and fight in order to survive long enough to be rescued. This is a difficult movie to make emotional. The subject matter lends itself to it, but this only happened 6 years ago and most people remember the events and the outcome. The fact that most people know how this will turn out is a hard thing to overcome. This movie did that and more. The movie was tense, emotional and really sucks you in. You are on the edge of your seat almost the entire time and you actually forget you know how it will turn out. That is a tremendous thing for a movie to pull off. This is a great movie for all ages and I recommend this. The movie fills you with hope and shows what humans can do when their backs are against the wall. Overall, one of the best movies of the year. I highly recommend this. I give this an A-.",
         "I really tried to like this but it was a hopeless battle. Poor effects, strange casting and a very long, dull, monotonous script made this more of a chore than a pleasure. I quite enjoyed Everest recently and was hoping this would be of the same. Sadly this was a long drawn out mess. The subject matter while interesting and dramatic was not utilised and you felt nothing for the miners. Although you know before hand that there were no fatalities among the group the writers do nothing to push you into thinking they were in mortal danger. When the end finally came there was no sense of relief of feeling of jubilation the movie just fell flat. If you're expecting something good here move along mediocre at best",
         "Sometimes in life you come across stories that are so intense and complex they are worth being immortalized on film. And the 2010 Copiapó mining incident in Chile is as intense as it gets. All of the sudden, everyone back then got out of their routine and turned their attention to Chile, where this surreal situation of 33 souls trapped 700m deep in the entrails of a very unsafe mine. Were they alive? How many survived? If they managed to, are they well? And, above all, could they be rescued? As the days passed, each one of these questions were answered in a miraculous way: against all odds, that note determinedly handwritten in bold red defied circumstances and extolled hope: \"Estamos bien en el refugio, los 33\". Fueled by this motivation sparked from underground, an entire country -with the whole world watching- began the war against the clock, with the clear resolution of getting them to the surface, and reunite with their families. This film brilliantly captures every single of those moments, with the precise amount of drama. Great performances from the actors, the cast delivers every single emotion convincingly, notably the actresses, Banderas, Santoro and Raba, who successfully connect with the viewer. The atmosphere is also claustrophobic, aided by the sound editing, that helps the audience feel right there, trapped beneath rocks. Some side-stories help to give context to the story, and even balance it with humorous moments. It is a roller coaster of emotions that, despite possibly knowing how it all ended, keeps you at the edge of your seat. Perhaps its only downside -which is an important one for me- is the film editing. Some scenes appear to end abruptly. A major principle in drama is that you must leave some time for the spectator to process the emotion you have just conveyed. For moments, there's no transition: you get shocked by a sensitive scene, only to be immediately swept by a funny one. And even worse, transitions between scenes taking place in the refugee and the surface are not as smooth as you'd want, given the obvious difference in lighting, even leading in one occasion to me being left almost blinded after a cave scene cuts inadvertently to a bright sky. These aspects should have been taken into account and prevented. It's a shame they didn't have the tact to consider this while editing the film. All and all, it's a great real-life drama movie. You will be touched by the performances and the overall atmosphere, if you do not let yourself be distracted by the graceless editing. But it's greatly scripted and directed. The final scene, with the inspector of the mine breaking in tears while looking at the inscription the miners left on the bedrock summarizes the tragedy perfectly. And showing on screen the real characters of the story (who also worked on film production as well) right before the credits roll was a very nice touch.",
         "The 33 is based on a true story about thirty-three miners who were trapped underground after an earthquake back in 2010. A film adaptation could have easily been another one of those claustrophobic/isolated approach such as Cast Away, 127 Hours or Buried, where we only focus on the protagonist finding a way to get out. But no, it's a movie that bounces into different locations, characters (even outside the cave) and themes; so this might as well be The Martian, except it's twice as conventional and sentimental. Yeah, the movie doesn't quite manage to linger on the ordeals, which makes The 33 a mostly contrived piece of drama. The movie doesn't wait longer for the miners to face the mishap, though it does take some time to establish each of their personal life, more specifically with their loved ones who are also going to help pushing the government to get them back. After those moments of shoehorning, foreshadowing and the accident finally happened, the victims gone paranoid and plan ahead for the rest of their days, finally facing the reality of their situation, while their loved ones are protesting for the lack of information of the incident. It's not a bad setup, but as the story goes, it just goes to the most standard, almost Hallmark worthy drama. It hardly takes any risks, it just pushes into easy sentiments. Though there is some strong moments, well sort of. Specifically after an incredibly awkward hallucination sequence from the miners, it suddenly segues to a quiet moment of reality. That silence is the kind of gravity this movie needed more, but again, it's supposed to be a feel-good inspiration, so we don't see much of a compelling struggle. The characters aren't given enough definition either, aside of their families, thus their moments below the cave is basically just a series of melodramatic issues that get easily resolved. However, it is visually appealing, the production and the setting really look flavorful in detail. The direction also solidly put its action together, but only for the sake of spectacle rather than suspense. The acting is pretty strange, one could argue that these international actors are just great enough to play these roles, but the accents are just so unnatural. Put that aside, well their performances eventually turn out to be predictable in this dramatic platform's standards. I wanted to like The 33, this is a good story and I believe this can be perfect on screen if it was handled by a much inspired storytelling, but it goes to the breeziest route that every conventional drama typically end up. Maybe a little more gravitas like its quietest moments, maybe more depth from at least some of these miners aside of their relationships and single noted personalities. In the end, most of the conclusion feels unearned, not because of there was no effort, but because the movie doesn't quite linger at the more interesting parts of this dilemma. We've seen this approach before and we knew that it doesn't quite bring much tension, depth or complexity with its story, thus everything feels underwhelming.",
         "I wasn't really sure what to think of this movie when I first saw the trailers. The story sounded interesting and I was actually reminded of when these guys were trapped down there. How can you mess up a movie like that? Well, as soon as I saw that the film was in English I started to worry a little bit. What's wrong with using the native tongue and giving us subtitles? Can we lazy Americans not read? Whatever the reason was, it worried me a little bit. Fortunately, the movie is actually pretty good and I forgot about the language thing fairly soon after it began. I've never heard of the director before, a woman named Patricia Riggen, but I believe the film was well directed and I enjoyed what we were given. The story is based off of the true story of 33 Chilean miners that end up being buried underground inside a gold and copper mine. Everyone knows the mine is dangerous but the higher ups aren't willing to do anything to correct the problem and the guys inside suffer because of it. As strange as it sounds, these guys actually manage to pull together and ration their food until drillers on the outside are able to get food through to them. While the miners suffer on the inside, families, drillers, and one particular politician work to get them out on the outside. We actually got some pretty good talent for this film but I feel a little weird about some of the inclusions. Before we get to that, let's talk about some of the stand-outs. Antonio Banderas gets the most screen time as Mario Sepulveda. He's a family man and easy going guy at first but ends up taking on the role of the leader when the mine starts collapsing. We see many sides to Mario during the film but he always comes through to help his fellow workers. Banderas pulls off this role extremely well and it's nice to see him play something a bit more serious for a change. The spearhead of the rescue operation on the outside, Laurence Goldborne, is played by Rodrigo Santoro. He does a pretty good job as the Minister of Mining and almost seems like he's portrayed as a kind of saint. He always goes out of his way to do the right thing and wants to help the miners and their families. Everyone else does a decent to great job as well but there's a few things that bug me about the cast to the movie. Do Chilean actors and actresses just not exist in Hollywood? I mean, at least go for some more people that are actually Hispanic but there are a lot of people in this film that don't feel like they belong. For example, Juliette Binoche is an excellent actress but why in the world was she chosen to get the most screen time out of all the other ladies and she's the one that's not Hispanic? She does a fine job but it is a little jarring right at first. Bob Gunton and Gabriel Byrne also stood out like sore thumbs to me and it makes me wonder if they ran out of Hispanic actors and actresses. Don't get me wrong, these are all talented people but I didn't for a single second believe they were a different ethnicity. Fortunately, the movie is still pretty good even though there are some scenes that took me out of the experience. The best parts of the film actually take place inside the mine. The mine itself is almost complete darkness because of the lack of light which really helps to set the mood and makes the situation seem even more hopeless. Seeing all of them pull through together and help one another shows just how resilient humanity can be. I know the families on the outside were worried about their loved ones but the struggles of the miners are what we really want to see. Despite a few complaints, this is still a really enjoyable film. The story is interesting (and true!) and the scenes inside the mine are really well done and help to make the situation seem even more hopeless. The acting is also excellent in the movie but I couldn't help but notice the lack of actual Hispanic actors and actresses. Still, it's a small complaint considering how good the film is. I would recommend giving it a watch if you're in the mood for a good drama and a true story.",
         "As with all movies \"based on\" or \"Inspired by\" a true story, this movie might be filled with some embellishments or even flat out fabrications. If that's true then shame on the producers. I know nothing about the true events except what I learned from watching this movie. And I have to say I thought the movie was awesome. There were a few things that could have been done better. Using Caucasian actors to play Hispanic roles was pure Hollywood Cheese. They can't get passed the idea that only movies with white actors make any money. What they won't accept is that bad movies with white actors don't make money either. But The 33 is an awesome movie. It's a gripping family story, human interest story, character driven, keep-the-tissue-handy kind of film. If you, like me, wonder why they never make good movies anymore, check out The 33 before it goes away.",
         "Given a full-on H'Wood treatment, the compelling story of \"The 33\" trapped miners becomes tasteless fodder for international audiences. The Chilean government and mining corporation accepted the deaths of these miners even as they still lived and breathed. The filmmakers also treat this story with a carelessness further burying these brave men. There's a roster of stars wringing hands and fretting in an embarrassing and juvenile dramatic fashion. The only fireworks from scrappy Juliette Binoche who drives the continued efforts to save these men. The rest of the cast simply deliver predictable lines in a contrived, static plot based on a novel by one of the survivors. Was it really that calm and boring among these men? The setup is too short to provide empathy. That may be a function of the sheer number of men. However, it leads to a lack of emotional investment in them. Portraying caring relatives above does not pay off the investiture in those below. Even two-way video messaging between trapped and relatives is flat and dull. Their release from the grip of the mine is therefore anti-climatic and borders on \"so what.\" Having never been in a mine, nor being an engineer, when the initial pilot hole misses by thirty feet due to rock dynamics a question arose, \"why not drill for the variance.\" It took the cinematic engineering geniuses another hour of screen time to figure this out. That and the 'Mericans save the day through perseverance after other drills quieted. What would Chile do without the good ol' US of A (a question those who suffered torture and death at the hands of CIA-backed puppet Pinochet in 1973 might best answer). That the dialogue is English with a few non-subtitled Spanish passages is a condescending pat on the head to the countrymen whose language was not used. It takes firm resolve to take a highly dramatic story and churn it into baby food, and the filmmakers succeeded. Give this film a pass.",
         "I don't know if there can be spoilers for a movie that is based on true events, but I'll steer clear of giving too much info, just to be safe. The 33 is based on the 2010 Copiapó mine incident. The mine is 100 years in the making, and more than 2,300 feet deep. When a boulder twice the mass of the Empire States Building shifts, the mine collapses, trapping 33 men half a mile underground the ground. They only have 3 days worth of food and water. The mine is owned by a private company, and they don't begin to have the resources to dig the men out. When the Chilean government gets word of the incident, they try to come to the rescue. They quickly find that there is a reason it's taken 100 years for the miners to dig as deep they had. When they drill a small hole to the stranded miners, and find that the 33 men are still alive, the world takes interest in their plight, and several countries rush to rescue the stranded men. I loved this movie because most \"based on true events\" movies take too many liberties with the story in and attempt to thrill the audience, deviating so for from the truth that the whole movie might as well have been fake. Patricia Reggin handles this very well by focusing, instead, on the human aspect of the crises. There are a few 'edge of your seat' moments, but the true genius behind the film is the focus on very real problem of having 33 men trapped in a confined space when tempers are resting on a knife's edge.",
         "Squandering an almost unbelievable true story in a treatment that feels far to TV like to produce the emotional resonance needed in such a dramatic survival tale, Patricia Riggen's dramatization of the 2010 Chilean mining collapse that enthralled the world is a harmless attempt at bringing this stunning example of human courage and perseverance to the big screen but for such an unforgettable modern day tale, The 33 is sadly highly forgettable. With a recognisable if not an exactly star studded cast led by the increasingly aged looking Antonio Banderas who finds support from hamming it up co-stars Rodrigo Santoro and one time A-lister Lou Diamond Philips, Riggen puts a majority of its focus onto these three men as Banderas's Mario and Philips's Don Lucho survive under the collapsed mountain of San Jose with their 31 other co-workers and Santoro government official with a heart of gold Laurence Golborne manages the rescue efforts above ground but a key ingredient to films such as The 33 is getting the audience to feel their pains and sufferings and their triumphs but Riggen's direction is so stale and uninvolving that The 33 has a hard time making any form of impact with its loaded material. Many including myself would remember the travails of these 33 Chilean miners, trapped for months in the small space of shelter after the mining shaft they were working in collapses but Riggen fails to capitalise on our memories or feels from this time and it would be most adequate to describe Riggen's direction as cold and miscalculated and the aforementioned cast struggle with some truly groan inducing dialogue and even industry veterans Gabriel Byrne and the embarrassed looking Juliette Binoche can't make the cheese covered wordings work. Overall The 33 fails to make a dent cinematically bar a few sporadic yet impressive visual ticks and even the late great James Horner's intrusive score feels like a half effort. The true tale of these Chilean miners and there will to survive is a great story and as poor as The 33's execution is their plight is enough to make sure Riggen's film isn't a true turkey but for a tale that offers so much possibility (the psychological toll of being underground an example, something briefly touched upon here) The 33 feels like an opportunity gone begging with hopes left that one day a more polished and thoughtful incarnation of this story can be produced. 2 cookies out of 5",
         "The very human Mario Sepúlveda (Antonio Banderas) exemplified an attitude of never lose hope as long as there is one shining lantern in the darkness of the abyss. This sanctity gave rise to a superior quality of real leadership, in safeguarding the mission principle of life. A true down, but not out, groveling in the dirt TKO like comeback, by the humble gathering of useful people, resources, in further concord (the underlying real physical economy), while continually pushing the limits of human endurance and morality. The right stuff\u0085of which Chilean miners and families possessed, with not much else, the former USA once had same\u0085 in abundance just over 50 years ago, and willingly gave up on it increasingly. Here today in the US of A we would have, beyond a shadow of a doubt, eaten the Bolivian (tasty, just like chicken)! Antonio Banderas was truly graced in his passionate demonstration of a pure miner and gave it the unsurpassed down of the earth grit, in an unblemished powerful performance. To top that, it comes along with a very special unsoiled cast and crew in solid support. In conclusion, let's also give rise to, as crusty representatives of a further surface grubby humanity, a very long silence in the dark followed by an even longer foot stomping noise applause on behalf of any comparable progress pulled out of humanity, anywhere. Bravo! Special note: see also \"The Way Back\" (2010), with Ed Harris, for similar portrayal of increasing real human dignity while under stark survival conditions.",
         "Chile during the last century was not a happy place with the overthrow of Allende and the dictatorship of Pinochet. The stories didn't make that country have a good world image. But in a strange cosmic sense Chile rehabilitated itself with this story of the rescue of The 33 miners trapped half a mile below the surface. Chile's chief exports to the world are copper and nitrates found in the Atacama desert, one of the most forbidding places on the planet. It is said by geologists that there are some spots that have never seen a drop of rain for hundreds of years. This is where the miners work and where the story takes place. Antonio Banderas usually seen dressed to the nines in film breaks stereotype somewhat as the charismatic leader of the trapped 33 miners. You'd better have charisma if you want to keep 33 men from tearing each other apart for 16 days. The main focus of the film is the interaction of the trapped miners. On the surface Juliet Binoche also through charisma and chutzpah becomes leader of the families. Not a woman to be trifled with or shuffled off as the government and the mine owners learn. Also to be noted is Lou Diamond Phillips as the mine foreman who tries to tell the management what a dangerous place they have to work in. You'll like the rescue scenes as all kinds of methods are tried to reach the men. All in all The 33 is a fine bit of cinema.",
         "Are the miners and their families who were trapped and impacted receiving any money from the profits of this film? Were any of the minors involved in the filmmaking either as crew or actors as recompense for what they went through? Were the men and\\or their families part of the story. As in were they consulted and if so were they compensated? Have they seen the film and what are their reactions? Are they're lives still be impacted by the cave-in or does the money from the film help them in positive ways. As in, do they have enough food, shelter and can their kids attend school? Did they receive counselling provided by the company they worked for? Did the company who ran this mining operation receive money from the producers for making this film?",
         "\"The 33\" is a more satisfying film than I was initially expecting, largely because, especially in the wake of this tragic weekend that saw chaos in multiple different countries and countless causalities and injuries all over the world, it's a film that really emphasizes some element of human bonding in the wake of a tragedy. Granted, the characters in this film are pretty thin and bound together only by seriously unfortunate circumstances, but that doesn't entirely matter. The film focuses on their bonding and their acts of cooperation in a time when survival seems astronomically unlikely. \"The 33\" looks at a variety of angles revolving around the collapse of a mine in Chile in 2010, which left thirty-three miners trapped until complex drilling equipment could be acquired in order to determine if they were even still alive. Most presumed the miners would've been killed when the heart of the mountain collapsed or would starve to death before help even began to reach them. When the drilling commenced, and discovered that all the men in the mining crew were alive and surviving off of the mine's limited supply of food and water in the refuge, trying to build a system that could extract the miners was going to take more time and effort on part of the Chilean government. The miners were trapped for sixty-nine days before being rescued. Patricia Riggen's film attempts to focus on the miners trapped underneath hundreds of tons of rubble, more than 2,000 feet underground, and the families above ground, gathering around the gates of the mine. The families are immediately disgusted with the government's lackadaisical and stunted response for rescue efforts, with government officials doing what they do best - claiming they care and are doing everything in their power to remedy a situation when they are doing nothing of any significance and making no attempt to reassure or comfort the families of the affected. To get the problems of \"The 33\" out of the way, to begin with, the film still continues the trend of capturing much of its events in montage, the same trend we've seen assist films like \"The Martian\" and \"Pawn Sacrifice\" this year with telling their large stories in a truncated manner. This film doesn't encapsulate as much of its events in montage as those films, but it still does enough fast-forwarding to the point where we don't really get to know the titular thirty-three outside of buzzwords and blanket traits, like the leader is nicknamed \"Super Mario\" (Antonio Banderas) and there is one miner who is Bolivian that nobody seems to care for. With that, the montage effect is something that is used in films for an understandable reason, but overusing it results in a film that is made up of moments of greatness rather than a big-picture sense of greatness. Probably the most glaring concern with \"The 33\" is the choice to make the thirty-three Chilean miners English-speakers, undoubtedly a move by touchy studio executives who feared American audiences wouldn't want to sit through a two hour film and read subtitles (unfortunately, in many cases, they're probably correct). While it's not a glaring issue, it's a bit strange to see the family members, all of whom minor characters in the film, speak equal amounts of Spanish and English when their husbands, brothers, and boyfriends are largely English-speakers in a country where Spanish is the dominant language. But what \"The 33\" manages to get right is its human focus - a focus placed on acts of survival and cooperation, even when the miners become overnight celebrities. One particularly interesting angle is when the film's screenwriters - Mikko Alanne, Craig Borten, and Michael Thomas - show Mario's decision to accept a book deal on the incident for a large sum of money whilst still trapped in the mine. In addition, we see coffee mugs, t-shirts, and posters being sold that advertise the thirty-three survivors outside of the mine itself. These are the fine details that make \"The 33,\" a film that despite its miraculous true story sometimes feels like a cliché Hollywood parable on courage and keeping faith, a miner winner.",
         "The tale of the 33 trapped Chilean miners was almost played in real time as it attracted worldwide media attention. It was probably because of this media scrutiny that the Chilean government stepped up the rescue efforts with the aid of international cooperation. The 33 has a varied cast. Irish Gabriel Byrne, French Juliette Binoche and American Bob Gunton all have a crack at doing some kind of Latino accent. Byrne's character must have spent time in Dublin in the past. We see the 33 miners as people as they enjoy the barbecue with some Elvis being sung. However when the fateful day arrives, the mine collapses and the miners are trapped we see that their fate hangs in the balance as it is a question whether a rescue team could ever reach them. Here the story is divided between the trapped miners, the families of the miners making sure that help arrives and cajoling the media in this and the government at first reluctant to get involved in a costly exercise to save 33 men. Antonio Banderas is Super Mario Sepúlvedaand who tries to keep the trapped men going by rationing food and stopping them from fighting each other. Lou Diamond Phillips is Don Lucho who also tries to keep the men together but feeling guilty for not doing enough about safety concerns. The film though does come across more as a glorified television film. I just felt that the characters lacked depth, very stereotypical. Binoche the epitome of the angry Latino activist who takes no crap and happily will punch a government minister. The hallucination scene where the miners eat a gourmet meal just came across as silly and the film just felt pedestrian. Obviously it was going to be difficult to give 33 working class miners sparkling personalities but the film lacks drama whereas the real time news footage of the incident gave it an urgency and a human interest focus.",
         "A well done movie that basically delivered on my expectations. I would have liked to have seen more of the faith based aspect of this film, however. Faith carried them through this ordeal and that aspect was seen in glimpses but not shown in any great depth or relevance. It was certainly touched upon but it's almost as if the makers of the movie were afraid to go too far in that direction. Being caught in the middle and playing it too safe rarely results in exceptionalism. \"God was with us\" was scrolled on the wall by them as they left. It would have been great to see more of why they thought that. We saw them praying and their families doing likewise but by choosing to keep that private and internalized within the characters the director missed a huge opportunity to flesh them out more. Everything seemed rather average and serviceable until the actual contact that was made with the miners. That's when the movie jumped in to a higher gear and became much more enjoyable. There was very little character depth until the third act but how they closed the story really elevated this effort. Also, the performances were amazing. Antonio Banderas proves he still has the chops and the entire supporting cast was brilliant.",
         "Precise characterization of events, dedicated actors, great plot and faithful script. I am Brazilian and I follow all Rodrigo Santoro jobs. I'm a fan of Antonio Banderas and I think Juliette Binoche is one of today's best actresses. When it comes to films about events outside the USA, the actors are put to the test, because in general, the speech is in English. The accent and expression are complicated for the English language. The movie shows the reality of an enterprise and of every person involved in solving problems in a very precise way. I hope to see a film about the tragedy of Mariana - MG - Brazil, which took place in November-5-2015. Perhaps worse than the gold and copper mine collapses of Chile. Probably more than 8 dead and 11 missing people."
