         "\" I'm sorry you feel that way \" is by far Bill Burr's best work. The continuity is fluid and natural. I have been following Burr's work since the last two specials; which were great. He's just pure funny. If , like me, you connect to his material, you'll come back for more. Watch his interviews with Conan; they really shows his wit and outstanding sense of humour. There is a multitude of topics he talks about in this special, and none of them lack humour or the \"punch\". Burr's personality adds to the comedy. There is a sort of raw-finesse in his act. This I believe comes from experience and a natural comedic flair. I have hardly laughed this much watching any other comedy special. He's one of the best we have. It is worth one watch, at least. If you're easily offended or have ever been offended by stand-up, don't watch this or any stand-up comedy because that's hypocritical.",
         "I have been a fan of Burr for a long time now, I am happy to admit. His last two specials, which I caught on Netflix, were great - the second better than the first. This one though, literally knocks the cover off the ball. Burr is showing A-list chops with timing, delivery, and punchlines that are just epic, and topical, and honest. I had to rewind it at about every major punchline and watch the bit over again, sometimes three times and I laughed even harder the second time around. I am writing this because it showed up in my queue, and I thought \". . .ehh . . .\" Let me give it another day or two; don't want to burn out . . .\" Shall we call him the next big thing? Nah - we don't do that anymore. But, he has really found his inner comic, and it is really rad to have a guy out there just telling it like it is. His riffing is epic also, and if you don't like this special, you can seriously go #%@$ yourself! Mr. Burr - keep up the good work!!!"
