         "This is one of the most intellectually-devoid movies I have ever seen. The cover mentions that this movie was made in an attempt to ride the \"Meatballs\" fad of the '80s. The \"characters\" include an incoherent drunk \"grandpa\" camp owner, three horny adolescents who look everywhere for sex (especially for the owner's blond granddaughter, who reminds me of \"Blondie\"), a homosexual aerobics instructor who has a heart attack after sniffing two poppers and exercising to death, some white guy with an afro and a huge lizard on his shirt (i.e. making fun of the \"izod\" shirts of the '80s), and too many more to list. This movie is so ridiculous I can't even begin to delineate the absurdities that happen throughout the movie. Not to say that it is bad; I laughed at several scenes because they were so absurd. In one nonsensical scene, after the kids learn that grandpa sold the camp to the evil antagonist, the camera zooms in on a plate of breakfast arranged to make a stupid face (e.g. eggs for eyes, sausage lips, etc.) twice, with cartoon sound effects. It made no sense whatsoever. If you like nonsense, then \"Oddballs\" is a surefire winner.",
         "Some movies are bad. This one is incredibly bad. In fact, it's almost funny how bad this film is. It tries to be an Airplane- like spoof of summer camps at times and at other times, tries to be a coming of age film for twelve year olds. The film's level of humor though makes it seem like it was aimed at three year olds. In one scene for example, a guy puts on cologne and goes into the woods hoping to attract a babe who's there but attracts a bear instead. To make things worse, the actors are all incredibly amateurish and the low budget is evident in nearly every shot.",
         "Its hard to understand how this film ever got commissioned as there is not really a plot to it, its poorly acted and a lot of scenes don't really make sense and don't add anything to the already paper thin story. I came across this as a young man and my only real reason for watching it was the very ample breasted nurse Brigid who is at least something to look at as your mind drifts away from the film. The opening scene at least sets you up for the madness which ensues and we see a blind man driving the coach to summer camp and an Indiana Jones lookalike run over. There are no real star names in this it is a severally low budget film. i guess its meant to be a comedy but you will doubtless laugh once. All in all i would not recommend this film but you certainly will never of seen a film like this before."
