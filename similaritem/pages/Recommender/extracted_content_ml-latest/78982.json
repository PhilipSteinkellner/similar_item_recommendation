      "reviews": [
         "Stephen Frears was the ideal choice to direct this quirky little gem. His first film before a prestigious career in television and then in Hollywood shows off his sensitivity, compassion and efficency as a film maker beautifully. Albert Finney gives an astounding performance as our hero, Eddie Ginley, whose life on the surface is far from glamorous. An unemployed Liverpudlian who gets by as a bingo caller and wannabe comic, he is loved by everyone except his repulsive brother William (Frank Finlay) and has recently had to suffer his girlfriend (Billie Whitelaw) leaving him and marrying the sinister William. Eddie however has a boyish love for film noir, the stories of Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe, and the music of Elvis. When he decides to advertise his services as a private detective, he finds himself up to his neck in murder, drug dealing and South African politics! Finney manages both a weathered Scouse accent and a remarkable impression of Bogart incredibly. He is a lovable character, excellently written and played, who could have sustained a whole series of films. Billie Whitelaw is the Lauren Bacall style femme fatale, and the outsanding Janice Rule the seductive villainess. A fine array of British character actors like Bill Dean, Fulton Mackay and George Innes sprinkle the whole film with colour and eccentricity. The in-jokes for fans of Bogart films are spot-on but anyone can enjoy this film, with some superb one liners and very touching moments. But the whole film is stolen fair and square by the soundtrack, courtesy of Andrew Lloyd Webber of all people! From fifties style rockers, to pensive strings to huge, grandiose thirties style epic themes, the score is a delight. The finest moment is suely Eddie's outwitting of the irreplaceable Fulton MacKay on a tube train. Writer Neville Smith (who plays a small role) showed a less humourous approach to a loner's hero worship of his idols in his 1979 tv play Long Distance Information, in which he played the lead character, Christian, an Elvis obsessed DJ who is working on the night of the King's death. Gumshoe is not really a comedy though, but a pastiche, affectionate and observant. It does have it's dark moments though, including a heroin suicide and a couple of moments of violence. And like any good Raymond Chandler, the plot is unbelievably complicated and the least important element!",
         "A Liverpool bingo caller of the 70's enlivens his dull life by taking on an old style private detective alter-ego. Complete with raincoat and accent! This is one of my favourite cult movies and this might be a good chance to try and look inside my own mind and find out why. Leading with the negatives, this film has a few ideas, but not enough to make a full film out of them. If you feel that some of the scenes are padding (quite a lot actually) then you are right! Finney fancies himself as a kind of Sam Spade let loose on a Liverpool of the 1970's (interesting to see it like it was in the 60's) and we enter the slightly seedy world of the working man's club. Something that those outside of the UK will find hard to grasp -- a kind of cheap private drinking hole meets low rent cabaret. The real problem is that the thing is weakened by non of the parties (especially the lead) seeming to be taking the case seriously, which means that while he is in limited danger we are more yawning than sitting on the edge of our seats. What makes it for me is the fast word play of Finney and the general irony of the script in going in to places that fashion says we shouldn't be going. It leads up to a giant feeling of so-what -- but I like to see movies that are a bit different and it always holds me in its strange faded and seedy grip. Maybe it has something to do with having been to these sorts of places myself.",
         "This film buzzes with excitement and whips along at a great pace. It's cliché precisely because Eddie Ginley sees everything that way. That's the charm. The script works well, and is a delight if you concentrate (!) All the actors give deeply - the sparring between Finlay and Finney is marvellous. How they kept straight faces is a mystery - they seem to be enjoying it so much. All the locations are raw and stark but never over-done or contrived. What you see is what there was in 1970's Liverpool and London. A thoroughly enjoyable film with a top-class cast.",
         "What a joy to watch this oddity from the great British director Stephen Frears' back catalogue on telly here recently. But because of certain parts in it, I can sort of see why it has largely stayed in 1971, a cult rather than a mainstream success. The story is a funny and modern take on a classic film noir. Being a Stephen Frears film, it's overflowing with observant details that make up a free-flowing, vivid picture of life in 1971 in the mind of a young man, Eddie Ginley (a young and handsome Albert Finney) who works nights as a bingo caller in a nightclub but dreams of a future as a stand-up comic. His overachieving brother has \"run off with his best girl\"; he's a dreamer, obsessed with crime fiction, and wants to be a detective, and he's about to get what he wants in spades. (Intermittent spoilers from here on in.) It's hard to tell now (or have I lost my sense of irony?) whether Eddie's cheesy stand-up routine and his casual racism are ironic character elements or for real. The 70s really were the dark ages, so nothing would surprise me now. I don't think I'm being oversensitive: his comments to the sole black character, Danny Azinge, are horribly racist and unsubtle and unfunny. Anyone who watched \"Bless this House\" or \"The Black & White Minstrel Show\" in the 70s, and any first and second generation Black Britons will tell you that it's all too likely to have been for real. Even Danny's terrific punch to Eddie's solar plexus � serves him right � doesn't wholly compensate for the nasty taste those lines left in my mouth. But I love, love, love the witty and cheeky takes on 40s noir and Chandleresque dialogue and story structure. The sexual tension between Eddie and his ex, now sister in law, Ellen (a stately Billie Whitelaw), crackles along. The Cain & Abel backstory is nicely played out. Eddie's brother William is the perfect foil: enough of a \"schmuck\" to make Eddie appealing, but sensible enough to be plausible second choice for Ellen. Some parts of the film now work best as social documentary; the 1971 era fire engine, the now sadly extinct open-backed red buses; Ellen's 'snazzy' car (sounds like a super-fast tractor); the comment on Liverpool \"it's not a gun town, is it?\". I think Frears understood the social significance of filming realistic scenes in a dismal unemployment office, and in the working men's club; you see it in the love he shows the building, the head honcho with his fake celebrity portraits; the reactions of the crowd. The story's pretty engrossing, and the way it's played out has all the hallmarks of a good Frears film, but it's the central love story that I find appealing. You look at the two men in her life and you understand why Ellen made the decision she did. Charming and endearing as Eddie is, and as she certainly still finds him, she got tired of waiting for him to stop being a dreamy low-rent clown. Their sad, simple kisses reflect that. He 'grows up' by the time the film reaches its conclusion, but by then it's all far too late. His life's romance is dead, but his life begins. Lovely stuff.",
         "The only possible bad thing that can be said about this is that Frank Finlay's accent is right out of the Northern Character box. Albert Finney's scouse accent is spot on, but Frank... I don't see how you can excuse that, especially after nearly ten years of the Beatles being everywhere, all the time. The same is true for a good many of the characters in Get Carter, very few of which sound to originate from Newcastle. In comparison to Get Carter, this is just as complicated, taking its time to reveal the key to the mystery, which I think (though I could have missed it) was the white leader of a black south African independence movement and his kidnapped daughter, so elements perhaps of Casablanca coming in there. It is fantastic to examine that typically 40s character, which seems so natural and realistic when played by Bogart, and take him out of that context into a very, very run down Liverpool, and see how he appears: somewhat psychotic in this instance. Eddie's wonderful lines come across as the product of someone just the wrong side of intense mania, especially as he gets deeper and deeper into the 'character' he finds himself playing. I wonder in fact if the relatively light and charming ending was the right way to go, and if he shouldn't have ended up committing some terrible crime because of his inability to stop being the detective, even when the mystery is solved. Interesting also to compare Finney's performance in this with another TCM favourite, Night must Fall, when the madness does overwhelm him.",
         "\"Exhilirated\" was the way my father felt, as he emerged from the new Scala cinema in Kings Cross, after watching Albert Finney in Gumshoe sometime in the 1970s. He loves the writing of Raymond Chandler and Dashiel Hammett. The idea of a fellow aficionado so caught up in the idea of being Philip Marlowe that he places an advertisement in the local Liverpool paper offering his services in 1972 as though he were the fictional private eye in California of the 1940s and is then caught up in a case he doesn't understand but which he sets out to follow nonetheless as though he was the legendary hero of those mean streets completely captivated him. The fast talking repartee. The refusal to compromise. And the gun. It comes in at the beginning. It is undoubtedly real - in an England where there are no guns. Will Finney who carries it everywhere with him ever get to fire it? Prepare to enjoy a pacey, brilliantly written plot which refreshingly expects the audience to have the knowledge and intelligence to keep up and be swept away. Anyone who knows my father will know that this review was really written by him!",
         "I recently saw this for the fourth time, the first time having been in the cinema upon its release. This first viewing saw me classifying it as a pastiche along the lines of Woody Allen's \"Play it again, Sam\" or \"The Black Bird\" with George Segal. In fact, the script and acting of \"Gumshoe\" make it infinitely better than either of these two and put it into that rare category of films, which actually get BETTER with each viewing. For a film approaching its fortieth anniversary, obviously much of the background, (such as the physical locations in Liverpool and Billie Whitelaw's being 'locked' into her loveless marriage with Frank Finlay), are now museum pieces/views into the past. Overall, though, the film still comes across as amazingly fresh and entertains from beginning to end. The lightning speed patter and one-liners are razor sharp and the performances by ALL of the lead characters are stunning. The nearest parallel I can find is \"The Third Man\" and, while it is definitely not in that category overall, I still think this is a very good film indeed which was vastly underestimated when it first came out,(for example by me!), and which only grows in stature and the enjoyment it affords with each renewed viewing.",
         "Produced early in Stephen Frears's nearly forty-year career, \"Gumshoe\" is an affectionate take on the Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler film adaptations that were popular in the 1940's. The movie is great fun, and Bogie aficionados will be especially pleased, if they can decipher the often-impenetrable British accents. Like \"The Big Sleep\" and other films of the private-eye genre, the plot is a series of seemingly unconnected events that, in this case, almost literally come together at the denouement. The smart banter between Bogart and Bacall echoes in the breathless quips that Albert Finney and Billie Whitelaw trade in some of the film's best moments. A Sydney Greenstreet wannabe is known simply as the fat man, and a dangerous beauty in the persona of Janice Rule is the requisite duplicitous fatale. As handsome as he was in \"Two for the Road\" a few years earlier, Finney appears to be having fun as Eddie Ginley, an English Sam Spade. He has the appropriately rumpled demeanor and looks good in a trench coat. His deadpan film-noir-style narration enhances the 1940's feel, although, despite the gritty color, the film cries out for the velvety light and shadows of black-and-white photography. Short, entertaining, and well made on all counts, \"Gumshoe\" is a minor gem that merits more attention. The film predates \"Prick Up Your Ears\" and \"My Beautiful Laundrette,\" the director's two breakout films from the mid-1980s, and, after the success of \"The Queen\" in 2006, viewers owe themselves the pleasure of discovering the talent on display in Stephen Frears's early efforts.",
         "Gumshoe (Stephen Frears, 1971) - or Scouser on the Third Floor, as I shall insist on calling it - is a skilled pastiche of classic film noir, with Albert Finney as a bingo caller and part-time comedian who fancies himself as a private eye. In his first day as a self-styled Sam Spade, he receives a mysterious phone call, plunging him into a superbly-realised world fusing the mundanity of Liverpool life with the Chandler-esquire yarn going on inside Finney's head. It's deftly done, with a ready wit and the deep knowledge of crime flicks (and the odd Western) essential to such genre explorations, while the script fairly drips with zingers. The narrative seems to house elements of Chinatown, Charley Varrick, The Cheap Detective, Hammett and Brick, but this was released before a single one of them. Another similar work, Play, It Again Sam, had played on Broadway but would not reach the screen for another two years. Finney is faultless in the lead, delivering his hard-boiled patter in a sliding hybrid of Bogart and Scouse, and keeping us guessing as to just how far gone his character is. The supporting cast includes Porridge favourite Fulton Mackay, making an ideal heavy as the Scottish hood on Finney's trail, Frank Finlay as our hero's menacing brother and Samuel Beckett alumnus Billie Whitelaw, playing a morally ambiguous woman caught between the siblings and sporting a hairstyle that would be impressively '80s were it not so resolutely '70s. Also cropping up in bit parts are Maureen Lipman as our bookshop floozy and Wendy Richards, speaking nineteen-to-the-dozen in a way that's very hard to decipher. Andrew Lloyd Webber's score - containing a rock 'n' roll parody written with Tim Rice - is also good fun, and if the eventual uncovering of the film's central conspiracy is a touch too small-scale to pack the requisite punch, that's a minor price to pay for 80 minutes of tense, superbly-scripted British noir.",
         "\"Gumshoe\" is a nice film for Albert Finney to show his talent for wit and humor. The movie came fairly early in his film career � at age 35 he had 14 total film and TV movie roles behind him. This is a very snappy film, with lots of quick lines and retorts. In the theater, I would have missed some of this. But on DVD, I can use subtitles and/or stop and playback for parts that I missed. Finney shows his talents for imitation and impersonation as well. His \"Boggie-esque\" quips are quite funny. Some reviewers dubbed this film an \"oddity\" or a \"curiosity.\" I'm not sure what that means. If it's because comedy is mixed with crime � well we have plenty of that dating back to the 1930s. The series of \"Thin Man\" movies with William Power and Myrna Loy helped make the comedy-crime mix very popular. Others have commented on the plot and cast. I will add only that this film is spot on for intrigue, and it has some very good twists. A casual viewer could miss a lot of what's going on. The roles are all quite good. Finney's Eddie Ginley is a very likable chap. Finney is one of those very talented people in the entertainment field who have played some great roles, but who have not struck gold spelled with an \"O.\""
