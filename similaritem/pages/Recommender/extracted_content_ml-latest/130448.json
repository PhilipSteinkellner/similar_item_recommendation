It\u2019s bland, lifeless, vanilla, and feels like what the Lifetime Channel in America would do to a remake of the Tobe Spielberg classic haunting film. I think the only reason Gil Kenan was hired for this movie was because the movie is based around a monster house and he depicted a monster so well in his last film that the job only seemed like a no brainer. The problem is Kenan forgets to produce likable characters and interesting scares during the process of producing an evil possessed house. - _Zevi Wolmark_",

            "content": "> Would have been a better film if it was an original.\r\n\r\nUnnecessary to compare this with the original and I tried, but impossible to avoid it since it's an official remake. Everything, from the house to frame by frame, all the scenes looked the same, except the cast and it's set in the present world with the daily life's modern gadgets. If you had not seen the 80s film, then there's a little chance you might like it. Though it was not a serious horror movie, or a scary movie to consider, still quite enjoyable like a dark comedy in parts. But I recommend the old one.\r\n\r\nReally? Sam Rockwell? He did not fit in the role, just okay though. And the kids, did not impress me as like the original movie. The only upgrade in this new version was the technology, CRT monitors to LED kind of stuffs. I expected a major, at least a bit alteration in the story or the screenplay that sets in a different circumstances and the location. That could have been a lot better. Disappoints for those who loved the first version. However, that movie deserved to be remade, and I did not think it would end like this. Hoping for a better sequel, but I'm already feeling that would end in the hands of the second string cast and crew which could be a cheap horror-thrill.\r\n\r\n5/10",

            "content": "I had huge reservations about watching this remake, which I felt was completely unnecessary. It wasn't as bad as I had anticipated, and that the bad reviews at the time gave me the impression I should fear or avoid watching it. The special effects were pretty good, and Sam Rockwell, Jared Harris and Jane Adams (how wonderful it was to see her again, after her exceptional work in 'Happiness'!) sold the film for me. I knew what to expect after liking, but not loving, director Gil Kenan's earlier animated 'Monster House', but I was intrigued how his energetic directing would transfer to live-action work.\r\n\r\nI think they could have made it more suspenseful and scary, but I'm not really sure that was their intention. I think they were going for a family experience with some thrills, chills and laughs...such as the recent 'Ghostbusters' remake was going for. If that was the case, then in that regard it was quite successful. I'm looking forward to re-watching this eventually with my 13-year-old son, horror-film aficionado, Julian, who like me adored the original.\r\n\r\nIf I was to make the perfect 'Poltergeist' film, I would have taken the same exact Steven Spielberg script and simply updated the special effects. I think that would have been a more successful approach.",

            "content": "The movie blurb is written by some 20th Century Fox representative. I would guess that the person in question has not even watched the original movie. \u201cLegendary film makers\u201d? What a load of bull! These people have not produced anything really worth watching and this movie certainly do not improve on that score. I mean, how dumb are these people from 20th Century Fox? I certainly hope the audience are not dumb enough to fall for this obvious lie. Judging from the, well deserved mediocre score on various review sites I guess they did not.\r\n\r\nAnyway, as for the movie. It is a bleak (cheap) shadow of the original. It has absolutely zero of the charm that the original movie had and, most importantly, none of the characters had anything of the charisma that the original characters had. The father is a total dumbass and an irresponsible at that. The mother could by just any Hollywood style housewife.\r\n\r\nWhen you finally think that something interesting would happen, that is when the ghost hunter enters the scene, it just falls flat again. He is just totally lacking in appeal. He is neither a bad ass nor is he mysterious or anything else that makes him worth watching.\r\n\r\nThere are just so much things wrong with the story as well. How can this guy afford and get a one for a house when he apparently do not seem to have a job? He even manages to go for another house in the end after his original one apparently got shredded. How bloody dumb is the script writer? In the original it was a new neighbourhood which explained the \u201ctroubles\u201d. In this one it is not which means that the script writer obviously had zero understanding of the original plot which brings us back to the same question again. What the f\u2026?\r\n\r\nThere are some half decent CGI scenes in this movie but the same can be said for a lot of things coming out of the movie industry nowadays (well with the exception of SyFy productions of course).\r\n\r\nI would say that as a TV-movie it would have been above average. As a remake of a classic it totally falls flat. I am happy that I watched it at home and did not spend time going to a theatre watching it.",

      "synopsis": "(Note: this is a remake of the 1982 Tobe Hooper directed horror film of the same name) The Bowen family - Eric (Sam Rockwell), Amy (Rosemarie DeWitt), Kendra (Saxon Sharbino), Griffin (Kyle Catlett), and Madison (Kennedi Clements) - move into a new home. Upon arriving, Griffin wanders through the house. He notices Maddie talking in front of her bedroom closet to an unseen presence. Griffin also hates that his room is in the attic. He hears a noise in the corner. He opens a door to a cellar and sees a red ball on a string. He pulls it and a bunch of creepy-faced clown dolls pour out. Griffin gets Eric to investigate. A squirrel then pops out of nowhere and frightens them. Griffin chooses to sleep somewhere else until the squirrel is gone. Griffin catches Maddie talking in front of the closet again. This time she shows him a trick where she touches the handle of the closet and her hair stands up. Griffin tries it and they both laugh. Some of the electrical items in the house begin to turn on by themselves. Kendra's phone gets ruined, which she blames on Griffin. At night, the kids' toys and several lights go on and off. Griffin walks downstairs and sees Maddie talking in front of the television. A bunch of hands press up against the screen. Griffin runs to protect Maddie but is pushed by an invisible force. Eric and Amy go downstairs to see Maddie in front of the TV. She turns to them and says, \"They're here.\" Griffin notices more of the weird things happening in the house, but nobody listens to him. He raises his voice to his parents, making Amy say that he's behaving like a baby. He runs back to his room, hurt. Eric and Amy go out to dinner with some friends, leaving Kendra to babysit. The couple learns from their friends that their house was built on an old burial ground. The spirits in the house begin to properly haunt the kids. Kendra's new phone flickers and she hears a three-note sound that she follows to the basement. The floor cracks open and oozes black sludge. To her side, Kendra sees a skeletal ghost. Then a hand pops out from the sludge and grabs her leg. In Griffin's room, the tree over the house beats against the window during a thunderstorm. The creepy clowns start moving everywhere until one doll actually attacks him. The branch then breaks through the window, almost hitting Griffin with broken glass. He runs to Maddie's room to find her huddled in the corner as the closet is creaking and making a weird sound. Griffin runs to get help and is pulled by the branches of the tree. In Maddie's room, several lights head toward the closet. Maddie's Piggycorn doll rolls into the closet. Maddie follows it until she sees that she is deep in her closet. A pair of hands grab her and pull her into the darkness. Eric and Amy return to find Griffin in the tree until he falls from it. Kendra runs out and says she can't find Maddie. The family looks everywhere until Griffin hears Maddie's voice in the TV. She's calling for her mom. Amy and Griffin visit the office of Dr. Brooke Powell (Jane Addams), a paranormal researcher. Griffin blames himself for what happened to Maddie because he left her alone, and he asks Brooke to help bring her back. She takes on the Bowens' case with her assistants Sophie (Susan Heyward) and Boyd (Nicholas Braun). They go to the family's home to find any sign of Maddie. Boyd sits on a chair that flies from under him and up against the wall. The crew sets up to record whatever they can. Boyd goes into the closet to add a heat sensor. He taps the wall and finds a hollow point to drill through. The drill gets pulled into the wall, creating a huge hole. Boyd sticks his arm in there and gets pulled against the wall. The drill starts to make holes closer to Boyd's face until he is let go with a red mark on his arm. He looks back at the wall with no hole and back to his arm with no mark. Boyd runs back downstairs with everyone else, now definitely believing their story. Brooke suggests that this is the work of a poltergeist, which means these spirits can interact with the living world for their own means, and there is more than one spirit involved. The team and family get contact with Maddie through the TV again, until the poltergeists push the TV and break it. Eric goes into Maddie's room and smashes through the wall with a table leg, and then shoves a huge part of the table through the wall. This opens a portal from the closet to the living room ceiling. Brooke then decides she needs to call in the only person she knows who can stop this. She calls in Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris), the host of a paranormal investigation series, and her ex-husband. Carrigan suggests that Maddie has a gift that allows her to communicate with the spirits, and her purity is the key for the spirits to move forward. Although Eric is hesitant to trust Carrigan, he knows he has no other choice if he wants to get Maddie back. Together, they throw a rope through the closet and out the ceiling to make a chain with which to bring Maddie back. Carrigan uses one of Griffin's toy drones to fly in with a camera for a sign of Maddie. The drone flies through the portal, giving everyone a view of the house, infested with countless spirits. The drone eventually finds Maddie, who hears her family and calls to them. Three spirits pull her back, alerting everyone. As the adults argue as to who should go in, Griffin runs upstairs and goes to save Maddie himself. He goes through the portal and finds Maddie. The poltergeists pull the rope and throw it through the other end. Griffin takes Maddie and runs toward the exit. The two of them fall from the opening of the ceiling. Their parents revive them and embrace them. The family starts to pack their bags after thanking Carrigan, believing the house is clean. Maddie says it's NOT clean, despite Amy thinking she helped get the spirits toward the light. Maddie says she didn't since she was pulled out before they could go. Eric starts to drive the family out until the poltergeists attack again and push the car through the house. They begin to pull Maddie back toward the closet. The family runs over to save her. The spirits then emerge in their ghoulish forms to pull Maddie back themselves. Carrigan then commands the spirits to retreat and leave the family alone. He knows what he must do to stop this. He runs up to the room and allows the family to escape while he gets pulled into the portal himself. The Bowens retreat in Sophie's car and drive away. Maddie then sees a beam of light burst from the house, suggesting the spirits have moved onto another realm. In the aftermath, the team tries to find a sign of Carrigan. After spotting nothing for a while, they find a signal near the bottom of the house. The Bowens start to look for a new home. They visit one house that the realtor describes as having big closet space. After seeing the big tree outside and other reasons not to stay, the Bowens leave and decide to just get out of town. Shortly after the credits start, we see Carrigan (alive and well) in his show, only with Brooke joining him. She tries to do his show's catchphrase, to his disapproval.",

         "I can't really remember the original. I do know that when it comes to horror I prefer practical effects over cgi. And this remake has way too much cgi. The old one of course only had practical effects. I still don't remember it as scary though. Except one scene where a technician in horror thinks he's pulling his own face off. This being PG13, we only get a scene where an annoying rude Ashton Kutcher-type-technician gets his arm stuck and is almost getting a drill into his face. Pretty lame.Especially considering the scene just before where it would have been nice if he had been killed by the drill. The acting goes from bad to decent to bad to decent again. And there are plot holes biggger than the one in the little girls closet. For a family that has lost their youngest daughter to angry spirits, they remain very calm, only to break down a couple of times. If I had kids and one of them had gone missing, I would be terrified all the time, unable to eat or sleep. As far as plot holes go, the entire movie is a major plothole, like how a father who was recently fired, can get a bankloan to buy a house.Especially since the mother isn't working How the family can just borrow the ghost hunters car at the end of the movie, only to never give it back and never come back for their own car. How the father with cancelled creditcards can buy expensive gifts for his family. How they're forcing their boy to sleep in the attic,. when he's terrified. How they find creepy clown dolls in his closet and don't get rid of them, even though they scare the boy. As far as the girl gone missing this was done way better in Insidious where a boy went missing the exact same way. And most likely much better in the original Poltergeist movie. If you can live with all these plot holes and some annoying characters, acting illogical in many situations, then you will like this movie. If you want good acting and real scare, watch Insidious instead.",
         "Have you seen it? No? There is likely a very good reason for that...it stinks. Like nearly ALL the endless remakes and reboots that have been plaguing movie goers for the past decade or so....all this is, is a heartless version of the original. It has no heart. It has no soul. It is a retelling of a film that we all love and cherish...and it adds nothing to the story. It improves nothing but the special effects--which held up very well over time--and in some cases belittles the fans of the original...particularly in the fact that they remade the movie at all, without adding anything clever to it. Like so many other remakes it is a hallow shell of the original.",
         "I actually created this account just to make this review. I've never ever seen such a bad acting Seriously the (Dad) is trying to be so cool all time so it gets embarrassing. His walking like his a bodybuilder and got this rough hard attitude against his family members so its just make you wanna crawl out of the skin AWFUL: Same with the mother absolutely ZERO actress and their dialog are so unnatural like their reading it from a book. Alsom their expressions doesn't fit what they're saying at all. There's not even ONE moment where i even get a little scared all is so predictable. I cant believe they got the permission to do a remake of this (cult movie) Don't see it just keep you're memories from the original MOvie. Im honestly stunned how bad the (Parents) are its like a Joke.",
         "Let's get this out of the way: Remakes never surpass the originals (aside from very rare cases like John Carpenter's The Thing). The premise is the same - a family moves into a house that's haunted with a poltergeist, their daughter gets trapped into the \"spirit\" realm and they hire an expert to help the family get her out. It's essentially a retelling of the original story with a few tweaks and a ton of CGI. So is Poltergeist one of the rare instances where the remake is as good or better than the original? F*ck no. But that doesn't mean it has no entertainment value as a standalone horror flick. Poltergeist is a popcorn movie more than anything. Everything about it, from the poor writing to the lukewarm thrills, only provide surface-level enjoyment. It never gets under your skin like a good horror film should. It's not scary or disturbing, and it definitely won't stick with you once the credits start to roll. The problem is that Poltergeist is extremely formulaic and predictable. They set up these creepy scenarios and build up suspense by making it really quiet for a few moments, and then a few seconds later... BAM, loud noise and creepy face jumps at you. I love me a good jump scare but the scares are cheap and you can see them coming from a mile away. It's a shame because there are moments where you can tell the director is trying to build tension and unease, but these easy scares ruin any momentum the atmosphere had going for it. Acting wise, Sam Rockwell is the obvious highlight. He's a very talented, likable actor and elevates any scene he's in just by his presence. He could have easily done this role in his sleep or on auto-pilot but Rockwell commits to the part and is by far the most watchable and relatable character in the movie. The family dynamic feels real solely because of him. Jared Harris gives a great performance as well considering the limited screen time he was given. Which brings me to the characters themselves, and this is where the movie fails. Hard. The only characters that feel \"real\" are the father, the son, and the younger daughter (who isn't used nearly as much as she was in the original). Everyone else is just... there. The mother and older daughter add literally nothing to the story, the paranormal team members are completely forgettable and are only there for exposition, hell even Jared Harris' character is a huge wasted opportunity. It's the fault of the writers really. I mean there is some truly *cringeworthy* dialogue that's so unbelievable that it looks as if the actors are just reading off cue cards. And then they throw in a really really dumb love subplot between Jared Harris and the lead investigator which was a waste of time and excruciatingly awkward to watch. This movie does polish some classic scenes from the original. The living tree, the clowns (yes, multiple), the subterranean graveyard, etc. It all looks sleek, smooth, and modern. But again, the novelty factor is gone so you pretty much know how everything is going to play out. There's one iconic scene that they butchered though, anyone who's seen the movie knows exactly what I'm talking about. It just felt half-assed and shoehorned in simply because it was such a powerful scene in the original and the filmmakers probably felt obligated to throw it in. The difference is that the original version was haunting and unexpected while this version lasts for like a split second and leaves you feeling absolutely nothing. Again, there's no point in comparing this to its original because it pales in comparison in every way. It's one of the better recent horror remakes sure but that isn't saying much. However, as a standalone B-horror midnight popcorn creepfest, Poltergeist can provide a modicum of entertainment. 5.5/10",
         "Yep. I'm a big horror films fan who had seen almost every single horror films had been release including Asians and European horror films. American horror classic is all about those cliché where a family moves into a new house which is hunted with a few jump scare and then the family conquer the ghost and it ends. But this film had almost none of that. They move into a new house and sh*ts happen. Like real scary sh*t. Not those cheesy jump scare but really scary sh*t. I was scare the whole film until the end and the storyline is just amazing. this is way way more better than any horror film I had ever seen.",
         "First of all i'm a huge fan of horror films, so when i heard about a remake to the Poltergeist i was so excited and couldn't wait to see the trailer which actually surprised me. And I've went to the movies expecting to watch the old movie but with a few changes. The thing is , they changed A LOT! So if you have the same expectation well it's not what you think it is. The pace of the movie was really fast in a good way but the only problem was the build up and that it lacked the feelings between the family. The Scare factor: It basically relies on jump scares but i have to admit they were perfectly done and well timed . There were some clowns in a box which were sort of creepy. and also some edge-of- your seat moments. It's similar to \"Insidious\" and James Wan effects. So yes when it says from the producer of \"Evil Dead\" you know what to expect, But it won't prevent you from sleeping. The acting was fine, CGI was okay and there were wonderful visuals. The 3D was mainly used for the jump out of your seat moments in a gimmicky way (Throwing stuff at the audience). In the end, I had fun watching Poltergeist and it delivers a few thrills,Sam Raimi did a great job producing this film,for Gil Kenan (Director of Monster House) i think it's a huge step forward. But don't go in with very high expectations or you will be disappointed. Although you should watch it if you're a true horror fan and you're looking for some good scares.",
         "what can I say about a perfect movie? Poltergeist is a very entertaining and scary movie. Sam Rockwell is perfection in the role of the dad buying a haunted house and Rosemarie Dewitt was great in the role as the mom. Poltergeist 2015 updates us on the movie of the same name in the 80's and it is refreshing to see the new model by director Gil Kennan who in my opinion did a great job executing new entities. I think the movie was fun and recommend it to old and new fans. The kids did a great job too, OK maybe there was a few laughable scenes like when Griffin gets pulled out of the house by the tree? But all and all I enjoyed the film. Go see it!!!!!!",
         "I'd there was a remake of Jaws it would automatically be shunned by most shallow movie watchers that's why happened to many other remakes that actually happened like The omen, Psycho and now Poltergeist. If this movie was renamed it would of not been unfairly compared and the reviews would of been better. Sam Rockwell was as entertaining as ever and even in a horror he has a way of putting a light on things. Not to get all that detailed Poltergeist has many scary moments and was well acted and written. I have no regrets spending a few bucks in seeing it at the movie theater. I prefer enjoying a movie for what it is instead of picking on every scene while comparing a totally different movie with the same name..come on people",
         "When you have a remake you can't really set it up to the original to be EXACTLY like the original. That would be boring and a waste of film. I watched the original when it was on TV one Halloween, and I fell in love with the film! Everything about it was wonderful! I think I was...7? 8? Anyways, I went to go see this the Friday that it opened because I was so excited to see it. Sam Rockwell was one of my favorite actors from the forgetful time between 1986 and 1991 as he starred in \"Clownhouse\" which was a marvel. Anyways, I was watching this movie and even though it does have jump scares, the idea that they were able to remake the movie and still have a good idea of the cast and how the characters were was good enough for me. Sure it was no Spielburg, but nothing will ever be the same as the original. I like to view this as its own movie and not one connected to an original, because then it looks better, feels better, and all in all is better. The character Madison was well thought out and was a good new take on Carol Anne. I liked how well the family reacted, they felt more like a family than other remakes (or sequels *cough cough* Poltergeist 3 *cough cough*) they felt more human. I do have cons for it though, I hate jump scares. They aren't scary, but they are a tacky waste. Given that, some movies kind of need at least a few to keep the ball rolling. This movie desperately needed it as if it hadn't most people would call it a yawn-fest or a snoozeathon. And not only that, but it would make the teenagers nowadays want to know more and seek the original. That's why this movie helps, rather than destroys this series' reputation. I liked the movie and will gladly see it again.",
         "This perfect 3 D film is based on the classic Tobe Hooper tale about a family whose suburban home is invaded by angry ghosts. I eagerly awaited for this excellent movie release and I am glad and satisfied it is a pleasing and a decent horror film. When the terrifying attack of spirits aggravate and move inside a suburban house in a quiet wealthy neighborhood a lot of suspense and unpleasant,but breath taking surprises appear for youngest daughter and the family must save her from her destiny. This film deserves to be a number 1 horror movie,everything about it is a masterpiece. See it and be your own judge about it!.",
         "I wasn't expecting to get scared at all during this movie but scared I got! They had some really good jump scares! I know most scary movie enthusiasts don't like jump scares and say they are cheap but I love them because that's why I go to scary movies... To get scared! I also love how they used elements from the original but also threw in some new stuff that made it scarier than the original. I don't know why this movie got bad reviews because I loved it!!! It gave me all i am looking for in scary movies: jump scares, suspense, good acting, and having you on the edge of your seat. This is one of the better scary movies that I have seen in a while. I highly recommend going to see this movie! it is worth the money!",
         "1)Poltergeist is a fantastic remake of the 1982 original movie . 2)It Has Good Horror and Excellent Elements Of Suspense. 3)Great 3D Visual Effects. 4)All the actors in this movie acted well. 5)The Cute Little Girl Kennedi Clements is not just a pretty face,but a lovely actress too. 6)Modest PG-13 Horror Movie without Offensive Words Or Explicit Sex. 7)The Editing Of The Film Was Amazing. 8)This Film Achieved International Success (It Was Number 1 And A Top 10 Movie In Various Countries). 9) I completely agree with the pretty Lesbian Girls Who Posted Positive Comments Here. 10) Go and Buy Or Rent This DVD If You Wanna Enjoy Seeing A Masterpiece Movie.",
         "I can't believe all the negative reviews I've seen of this movie. I always wonder if they're written by people who even actually like the horror genre, much less have a passion for it. This movie is a remake. Do not expect a remake to be better than the original. That is pretty much impossible. It's lost the element of surprise. How many horrors have we watched that are \"B\" or lower? Asylum Films anyone? We watch them because we love the genre. We look for redeeming qualities in any horror, no matter how bad. Humour, or effects, or acting. Sometimes it's just laughing at how fake the effects are and how bad the acting is. But we retain the passion for the horror genre and we appreciate any contributors. I do not like remakes that are exact copies of the original. This movie brought some differences, although the essence of the original was there. I appreciated this movie because it is a horror and one that had a significant budget. I thought some of the effects were great! If I had a complaint about this movie, it is that I wish it was a little bit longer, and put a little more complexity into the plot. If you love horror, I recommend this movie. If you love horror, you're not going to be disappointed. Just don't expect that a remake is going to be anymore than a pleasant trip into yesteryear to see an old friend.",
         "Not sure if any of my review contains any actual spoilers or plot details (i guess any review could be). My review is focusing on the general outline of the movie. I really liked this remake. I thought the acting was really good and the characters were really likable, the story basis and many of the events were pretty much the same as the original. There were plenty of suspenseful moments (had to close eyes at a few). The only reasons why i didn't give this movie a 10 was that the music score wasn't as creepy as the original, it was a little short on time and there didn't seem to be much of a battle with the spirits (as there was in the original). If you treat this as a separate movie completely then it is really good-there are plenty of jumps, the acting is great, special effects are great and there were plenty of nods to the original (for fans of the original). I thought this was a great movie -a worthy remake, and i hope they consider a sequel if it does well at the box office.",
         "I'd like to tell you all a story. Not a happy story, filled with fun and adventure...but a terrifying tale that began about 27 years ago, when I was just a child...one who found joy in simple things...like toys, clowns, and fun TV shows. That is...until one dark night...a night not unlike many other nights (or so I thought)...when everything changed. I was supposed to be in bed, asleep...but as usual, I'd crept-out into the hallway to sneak a peek at what my parents were watching on TV...and as usual, I was a bit anxious about what I might see. It may be something a kid my age shouldn't see. At first, everything seemed fine. I didn't know what it was that they were watching...but there was a clown (not a REAL clown...but a toy clown, similar to the clowns in my own bedroom), and that couldn't possibly be a BAD thing. Right? WRONG. Almost immediately, things went from \"fine\" to \"the stuff of nightmares\". The clown wasn't funny...not funny AT ALL. It was terror like I'd never known! I hurried back to my room, only to find the terror had FOLLOWED ME! In a state of panic, I grabbed every last toy clown in my room and placed them all outside of my door, then took shelter under my bed-covers where I eventually drifted-off into nightmare-land. From that day forward, I've been creeped-out by clowns, and never again did I allow them into my room. Fast-forward to present day. I now know that my fear of clowns is a result of witnessing one of the creepiest scenes from the original 'Poltergeist' film...and that's also the reason why I love that movie. Anything that can frighten a person so badly that it creates a lasting phobia, is a MASTERPIECE as far as this horror junkie is concerned. After much anticipation for this remake...I must admit, I was a bit nervous prior to watching it. The trailers looked GREAT, and I feared the film would disappoint (as so many films with epic trailers DO). It DIDN'T. Yesterday, I feared clowns. TODAY, I fear clowns more than EVER...but also stuffed pig-unicorns; the dark; light bulbs; closets; TV's; electricity in general; power tools; mini-vans; mud; cemeteries; the ground; walls; doors; sub-divisions; trees; windows; furniture; and any kind of ball. THANK YOU, Sam Raimi, for that. Just PLEASE don't ever make me fear coffee, cheeseburgers, or anything involving chocolate.",
         "Poltergeist is an impressive horror movie and is a good remake of the original movie. It does not deserve the hate.This movie is imperfect,but does not have errors.You will find good acting and great direction. The cinematography was lovely and the movie was entertaining from beginning till the end. Remember that Poltergiest (2015) was a successful movie all over the world. Some hate reviews don't necessarily mean that this movie is bad. I recommend seeing this lovely family movie. Kennedi Clements is sweeter than sugar and is so talented too. I am quite sure you're gonna love this amazing movie.",
         "Last decade the first rumors about a Poltergeist movie remake was cast. I had been waiting in ages for that. The hype was somewhat satisfied. At last this summer the movie was released. With stories about curses on the set like the first Poltergeist movie. Don't expect any big all star cast beside Jared Harris. This is about a family that moves into a suburban house. But, then the haunting slowly begins. The daughter in the family gets sucked into the ghost dimension by TV. Now it's up to the investigators to get back the daughter. Just like the original the movie ends with the house getting sucked away. Let's see if there will be two more Potergeist movies. The movie was rushed, but maybe after summer the extended editions will save it. 8/10",
         "If POLTERGEIST (2015) had not used the title and declared itself a remake of POLTERGEIST (1982), I doubt that the people connected with the 1982 original could have successfully sued the people of the 2015 movie for plagiarism. Yes, it's the same basic story - but with so many new twists and innovations that it is also a new movie. It's a haunted house - but not a new house. There was a previous occupant (but this aspect is not further explored, unfortunately). There's a family moving in, named Bowen, not Freeling, with a little girl, named Madison, not Carolanne. The parents do not smoke marijuana. The haunting attracts the attention of a TV exorcist, not a magical munchkin. And this new narrative includes such modern contrivances as smart phones, cellphones, laptops, and flat screens. Just so you know. The Bowen family, dad (Sam Rockwell), mom (Rosemarie DeWitt, of Rachel Getting Married, and United States of Tara), and teen daughter Kendra ( Saxon Sharbino, of Touch, and I Spit On Your Grave), nervous young son Griffin (Kyle Catlett, of whom we can expect much), and little girl Maddy (Kennedi Clements) move into a housing development not far from Molene, Illinois. The move was begun when dad was hired by John Deere tractors but somehow he was laid off before he even arrived, so they arrive unemployed. The house, however, is very nice, the previous occupant made sure it was wired up for cable and internet. Near the house are high tension power lines and some anomalies hinting at static electricity are blamed on that. Then we are told that the housing development is on the site of a cemetery - and not so old that all the graves were long forgotten and neglected, no sir, families still visit the graves at their new location. Except, of course, .... Before long, there's serious Trouble, and a professor of the supernatural (Jane Adams) is called in to help with a small crew of high-tech assistants, and soon enough a cranky TV cleanser of cursed houses (Carrigan Burke, of Mad Men) shows up to lend his expertise. Now I would like to point out the obvious defect in both the 1982 original and this remake. Leaving the coffins in the ground and moving only the headstones is a scam so transparent that it's a wonder someone wasn't arrested the first day. Moreover these houses have basements - considerably deeper than a grave (and the 1982 movie included an outdoor swimming pool). And, finally, if building over a cemetery caused any sort of haunting, then Paris would be one big chamber of horrors. This 2015 version has new twists, surprises, and special effects. This makes the original seem a tad pale (although I miss the musical theme of the 1982 version).",
         "I really enjoyed this movie. As a lover of the original Poltergeist movies, I felt that they really honored the original. I could see it's influence in this. But unlike many remakes it wasn't a line by line. It was adapted well to fit 2015 culture and storytelling standards and regardless of a few bad lines, had crisp direction and very believable acting. The effects were good, most of the time. Scary level was moderate. Not a whole lot of adult situations, so possibly safe for children over a certain age. And had some surprisingly funny bits thrown in. I enjoyed each of the actors and their characters... except for the older girl the first half of the movie... too spoiled. Overall, very enjoyable. If you love the originals, and aren't biased when it comes to remakes, you might like this adaption.",
         "Please let me begin by stating that I love the original movie; it is easily among my most favourite ever movies. For this reason, I decided to view this remake as it's own movie, trying not to compare it to the original. Being a fan of paranormal movies, and seeing the trailer for this movie, I had hoped that I was in store for a scarefest. By the time that the credits were rolling, I had realised that what I had seen was something quite different to what was advertised. The trailer shows that this is a very scary movie whereas, however desensitised I may be to the majority of scary movies, I feel that it is a lot less scary than it could have been. Please do not get me wrong, a good portion of the movie was scary, tension-building or/and interesting but then far too much of the movie was comical. For me, the movie felt almost like a ramped-up Ghostbusters. This doesn't mean to say that the movie was not entertaining, I was very entertained and I felt that the movie was good, just not necessarily what was advertised. I thought Sam Rockwell was largely mis- cast as the father of the family and felt that his role needed a much more commanding performance. It would have been interesting to see somebody like Christian Bale in that role. Rosemarie DeWitt did well as the mother of the family. Kennedi Clements performance was excellent and beyond her years as Madison and Kyle Catlett possibly shone as the star of the cast with his showing in the part of Griffin. Saxon Sharbino was just annoying and unnecessary as the elder daughter. I loved the effects that were used as nothing looked too unbelievable. Overall, this is a solid movie with a good script but expect to chuckle more than jump.",
         "Being a huge fan of the original, I was pleasantly surprised that this remake respects and echoes the original in the main, but adds twists and effects and tech that we use everyday to make it comfortably contemporary. But don't get comfortable. Once the scares start, they fly thick and fast. I recommend sitting close to the screen and have the volume turned right up. And wear old pants. And don't, whatever you do, use an electric drill again in your life ever. It's just not worth the risk. Don't set your expectations too high for adult acting - the kids steal the show here and run rings around their grown up colleagues. For the acting I've taken off a star. Summary - juicily horrific.",
         "This a very scary movie. It is better then the 1982 version. It is also better the Poltergeists III. Poltergeists II the other side is scarier. But still this a very scary movie. One of the scariest movies made in the last fifteen years. If you like really scary movies then you need to see this movie. This movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. A family find out that there house is haunted. See this movie. See all the Poltergeists movies. They are some of the scariest movies ever made. If you do not get scared of this movie then no movie will scary you. Sam Rockwell is a great actor. Rosemarie D.e.W.i.t.t is a great actress.",
         "(Possible Spoiler - just being cautious even though I am being vague about the new film) The original Poltergeist '82 was more spiritual, afterlife, evil creepy slimy things of lost souls, and it focused on that. As times have changed in the world, we have witnessed more real-life human atrocities, disasters, and horrors, that the general public is severely desensitized to horror films of that era. Unfortunately, with remakes, you get a majority of the population comparing it to the original, then giving it a bad review. The remake is designed around modern-day 'ghost-hunting', the focus on how spirit energy can be channeled through electricity (which, again, 99% of 'ghost hunters' focus on this in their investigations; EMF readings, ectoplasm, etc..), has some creepy spooks, some real good shockers, surprises, a lot of fun, and has all kinds of 'Easter Eggs' paying homage to the original film - a trademark that Sam Raimi follows in any of the films he has worked on. The film audiences need to go into a recreation of an original title with a fresh slate in their head, and not compare it to the original..... One final point, the Blu-Ray Director's Cut is a lot better than the theatrical release - you can blame Fox / MGM for that one...",
         "I remember watching the original Poltergeist movies when I was younger and after watching them I could not sleep at night. Idk what was with them but they were truly scary. This movie was also pretty scary but I can go to sleep at night without any nightmares or bad dreams (which I am happy with). It isn't that it was a bad movie it definitely wasn't and if you haven't seen it I would recommend it... but it isn't something I am going to keep thinking about. If you want to watch this so that you just cannot sleep for the next few days then this movie is not for you. If you want to watch it though to see very cool special effects, get scared when watching it (the first half), and to be engaged in an \"original\" horror movie idea then this is for you! Original of course being it is different than most horror movies other than its original counterpart. Mostly the movie is entertaining moreso than scary. The scenes in the movie were very well directed, acted, and edited. I really liked how the special effects were done. The movie didn't look all CGI but it did have good scenes well edited. It also had a good pace to it and I was left with wanting more. In conclusion, Poltergeist (2015) is a very good horror movie for 'our time'. It has good acting, good effects, and a good \"original\" story. If you like horror movies this is for you BUT it isn't something you are going to have a hard time forgetting. If you haven't seen it watch it! If you have seen it watch it again as it is very entertaining unlike most horror movies nowadays.",
         "I showed up to this movie ready to not like it after multiple remake disappoints... In addition I recently watched the original and thought to myself... This movie would be awesome to remake if the writer/director team does it right!?!... Well I got my wish, the movie was truly impressive. My entire office drove 30 minutes to the theatre and everyone felt it was worth the trip! The team sticks close to the original storyline... keeping true to the fans of the original and the actors do a great job bringing the characters to life. The CG was spot on and the movie reels you in.... The only reason I didn't give a 10 was because the ending seemed sort of abrupt.. would have like to see the journey of Zelda's replacement... would have been brilliant!"
