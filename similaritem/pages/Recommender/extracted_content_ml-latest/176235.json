         "My little brother loves Winnie the Pooh and was very excited about getting this. When we did get it though all it was was \"Boo to You Too! Winnie the Pooh\" completely replayed with a little scene at the beginning and end that has the Heffelump. Naturally my little brother was very disappointed because he had saved his money to get this and it turned out to be the same one he already had. This was a very cheap money making scam, using the title \"Heffelump\" to resell their entire show again. This show would probably be good if you don't already own \"Boo to You Too! Winnie the Pooh\" but if you do I don't see much point in buying this.",
         "If only they had a negative 5 rating! Our 4yr old boy used all of his piggy bank (his whole lifesaving's) to get this (from $14 at Wal-Mart 'DVD'). he was excited and thought it would be worth his hard earned money. When we watched it we were all gravely disappointed to discover that all they did is have an introduction and showed the whole previous film they made \"boo to you Pooh\". He already had that film (boo to you Pooh), and complained that he already had that show and that and I quote, \"I HAVE BEEN CHEATED!!!\". I am ticked at Disney, that they would cheat a 4yr old with such rubbish and charge $14 for it. Now don't get me wrong I like Disney, they have made and still make wonderful shows with good morals, but I am not at all happy with the people responsible for this scheme too make for money on their previous title \"Boo to You Pooh\". Now if you have not seen \"Boo to You Pooh\", you may enjoy this film, but if you have you are only re-buying the same show with a different cover!",
         "I have to say, I have been a fan of Winnie the Pooh ever since I was a kid myself, and am still very much so now that I am an adult, though I am young at heart. :) I have seen all the movies I know of (Many Adventures, Grand Adventure, Very Merry Pooh Year, Tigger Movie, Piglets Big Movie, Springtime with Roo, Heffalump Movie, and....this one). I have to say, I was surprised that they were going to release 2 movies within months of themselves...unfortunately, now I know why. Don't get me wrong. I fell in love with Lumpy too, just as I had all the Pooh characters years ago, and I think the voice of Kyle Stranger was great for him. Nikita Hopkins is the best voice I have heard for Roo, (though to anyone who has seen this movie, they will notice, like in Springtime with Roo, it is Jimmy Bennetts voice, not who I had expected). And I also have to say, I was a bit disappointed myself. I had no idea that over half the \"movie\" was going to be spent by Roo, trying to \"un-scare\" Lumpy by telling him the story of \"Boo to you too, Winnie the Pooh.\" I had thought that they were leaving any connections to \"The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\" out of the movies. Otherwise I would want them to bring Kessy back (from Find Her, Keep Her, and A Bird In Hand) :) Anyway, if they DO bring out another movie....which, knowing Disney, they will....I hope they do not try and pull another stunt like this. I take it as an insult, not only now, but to my joys of the past.",
         "I purchased this film on DVD for my 4 year old grandson and we loved it so much that I bought VHS and DVD copies for our library too. Lumpy, Roo's newest best friend, learns to be courageous and the story is the perfect spooky treat for your little Halloween goblins. While getting ready for trick or treat the familiar characters find they must tackle a new problem. At first each tries to be brave and succeed alone, then realizing they need to help each other and accept help from their friends they get together. You get to see Pooh, Tigger, Eeyore, Roo, Piglet and Lumpy as they come to terms with the terrible Gabloon. Lumpy is sweet, but I still love Tigger best next to Pooh of course.",
         "It is Halloween time in the hundred acre woods and it is also Lumpy's first Halloween. As the rest of the gang prepare him for the night he becomes scared and only is brave with his best friend Roo by his side. The plot thickens when Pooh eats all the candy meant for trick-or-treating and Lumpy and Roo decide to catch the Gobloon to wish for enough candy for everyone, and a Poohish adventure begins. The film is not a stroke of genius but it will entertain your children. There are some classic Pooh moments that will bring a smile to the parents face but all in all the kids will enjoy far more than you. Which isn't really a bad thing. The DVD has a few special features including a pass the pumpkin game which is a lot like hot potato. There is also a Heffalump Halloween party planner and on the DVD-Rom you can decorate your own pumpkin. Not Earth shattering but if your kids like the Heffalump movie, then they will enjoy this very much. 7/10",
         "This movie was okay. The story was original (except for the Boo to You Too scenes). The story is this: on Halloween Pooh eats all the Halloween candy so there will be none for anyone else. Tigger then tells the tale of the Gabloon and if you catch him you get 1 wish. Roo and Lumpy set off to capture it, but Lumpy gets trapped. A terrified Roo then runs to his friends and they save Lumpy. Now for the bad part, the song Roo and Lumpy sing is like torture. \"We're friends forever, we'll be brave together\" give me a break! I think my head was going to explode. In a nutshell- good film, awful song"
