         "content": "**When someone aimed a gun at Jesse...**\r\n\r\nThe fifth film in the Jesse Stone series based on the characters from the book by Robert B. Parker. That's right, this film is not an adaptation of any book, for the first time in the series it is an original screenplay. But the director was retained for the fifth time and that's a plus point here. Particularly who can understand not just this one film, but the whole series to take it on the right path. There is also lies some weakness that it's not getting better as it should be, but I would say it's the writing that did not impress me.\r\n\r\nThis is the half way mark and another film in the series that's not so good, but counting it as an individual, definitely it is a better one. I expected this film after the previous one was not up to its previous one, but I must say I'm slightly disappointed. It is enjoyable, as a television film and its production quality was undeniably great, but I think my over anticipation is what barred me from having a good time with it. I am not blaming the story, but the scenes which were not strong enough. The positives were you can't predict them, and what's more important than that in a detective story.\r\n\r\nIt opened with a shootout and Jesse got injured, though there's no serious. Now he has a case to pursue, but not official and his chief warns him going after certain person. Jesse also got enquired by an Internal Affair for him involving in the recent shootouts which is above normal. Besides, a mother came afar to him requesting to investigate her baby went missing seven years ago. Among the cases, the narration splits, but holds the suspense till the final act. There's no big twist, but both the cases come to end with Jesse's unique way of dealing.\r\n\r\n> \"The information's out there. All you've to do is let it in.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the tale is about to conclude, there comes a big blow to him and his future hangs. An interesting ending, maybe a turning point in the series like the season one ends here and the season two is about to commence. If it was a television series, this is where the split happens between the seasons. The Jesse's walk out of the station at the final scene brings a new perspective. A bit emotional, if you are a Jesse Stone fan.\r\n\r\nThe last two films were average compared to the earlier ones, so this change might refresh in the series going forward. It should be, otherwise I might lose interest in the series. This film is not bad, but after the fine developments in the mid part which was hyped, did not stand up to the expectations once the revelation came. There was no big expansion in the cast, but like usual some of the new ones, those who came only for this film had made some decent contribution. Like Jessica Hecht was the only known person to me who have made into it. And the rest of the cast including Selleck was great as usual.\r\n\r\nJesse still remains dominated, but kind of losing strength while other characters around him gaining the momentum in their small part. Because he's the same from the first film, though needs some upgrade like nothing for the additional, but feeding with what he's good at. I mean, he's a badass and a daring character, but lately his parts were not appealing enough as what he's known for. On the other hand, he's just a small town cop; his work is under a limit and that kind of big excuse we definitely don't want. Hope it will not be the case for the next one.\r\n\r\nI thought I was a Jesse Stone franchise fan after the first two films, but I'm not sure now, the only next couple of films would decide that. So I'm eager for the next sequel. Talking about this installment, I find it above average, but for being a television film and a film series, you can't blame entirely. Because like I said in the earlier review, the ups and downs are part of a film franchise and sometimes they're on purposely done to balance the good and bad side of the story and characters. Like a wheel it has to come up sooner or later, that means the next one in the series is very crucial. It's not the cast or the crew, but the story should be at its best. I hope it all comes back to the normal there. So I meet you there.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",

      "synopsis": "Tom Selleck reprises his role as Jesse Stone in the fifth installment of the Jesse Stone franchise from Sony Pictures Television, which includes \"Stone Cold,\" \"Jesse Stone: Night Passage,\" \"Jesse Stone: Death in Paradise,\" and \"Jesse Stone: Sea Change,\" the picture for which he received an Emmy Award nomination. The movies are based on the best-selling series of books by Robert B. Parker. In JESSE STONE: THIN ICE, Paradise, Mass. Police Chief Jesse Stone finds himself in trouble with the Town Council when he inadvertently becomes involved in a shoot-out on a Boston street. His friend, State Homicide Commander Healy, is seriously wounded and Jesse comes under investigation by the Boston Police Department's Internal Affairs Division, which causes him to be away from Paradise for extended periods of time. Jesse further alienates the Council by firing the Paradise Police Department's most prodigious ticket writer, resulting in a considerable loss of revenue for the town. His issues with the Council are further exacerbated when a celebrated out-of-towner shows up in Paradise in search of her missing child, and Jesse agrees to take her case. His continued defiance of the Council's wishes now begins to jeopardize his very job. Emmy and Golden Globe Award winner Kathy Baker (\"Picket Fences\") and Kohl Sudduth reprise their roles as the only police officers in Paradise. Stephen McHattie reprises his role as State Homicide Commander Healy, as does William Devane as Jesse's psychiatrist, Dr. Dix. Multiple Emmy and Golden Globe Award winner Camryn Manheim (\"The Practice,\" \"Ghost Whisperer\") joins the cast as Elizabeth Blue, a desperate woman in search of her child, along with Emmy winner Joanna Miles (\"The Glass Menagerie\") as a woman in Paradise who helps Jesse with his search for the missing child and Leslie Hope (\"24\"), who stars as a beguiling and attractive internal affairs investigator.

         "This is clearly written as the first of two or three stories. It continues several of Robert Parker's characters very well, while seriously taking a couple along different paths. Most notably, Jesse's character has gotten more serious, and more challenged by life. There was always the sense in Selleck's portrayal of a wounded soul . . .much more so than in the books about Jesse Stone. Overall, I liked this movie a great deal. I liked the expansion of William Devane's Dr. Hix character (\"Dix\" in the novels) and Suitcase Simpson's continuing confusion from his previous coma is still amusing, and occasionally disconcerting. But, although I liked the character of Rose, she is no replacement for Molly. Molly and Jesse's banter from the earlier movies is sorely missed. It added the levity needed as a counterweight to the heavier story lines. I did like those story lines. The shooting of Healey at the beginning of the show starts the story with a bang, and Jesse's dogged determination to track down whoever is responsible is completely in character, even if it does hurt him professionally. The other story line, about the mother looking for her lost child, seemed at the beginning to be entirely predictable, but then it was not. Camryn Manheim, as the mother, is amazingly good here. And may I just say that I love the music in these last couple movies. The music has gotten much stronger. Piano-based with a feel of Ravel or Satie, the soundtrack composer was listed during the credits, but I didn't catch the name. I might consider buying this soundtrack. I liked the ending, but it is clearly leading to the next movie. I can only hope that \"Jesse Stone: No Remorse\" finishes up a couple of these story lines. I'd like to hear what's happening with Molly. And although I think they tied up the story of the lost child fairly well, the plot with Geno Fish, and the shooter of Detective Healey, seems to have much more to play out in the next movie. And of course, we need to find out what happens next with the police chief of Paradise.",
         "While I do agree with this being the least of the series, I enjoyed the episode. However, my wife (who would leave me for Tom if he asked, I'm not kidding) didn't like it. As an example of our tastes, I loved Clint Eastwoods \"Unforgiven\" because the distinction between bad and good wasn't clear. My wife did not like \"Unforgiven\" because the distinction between bad and good wasn't clear. I think the story line was needed or the series would have fallen way to far into a formula driven format. That's why I think it would destroy the series if it was a week to week show. This episode must set up at least one or two more stories. I look forward to them.",
         "A fair mystery and secondary plot, but this one doesn't measure up to the previous episodes in the series. Changing Molly to Rose is inexplicable, the town council is larger than the police force and Sidney Greenstreet(!) are just a few of the irritants. Tom Selleck is terrific as usual, Cathy Baker does a fine job as Rose and William Devane is sarcastic and entertaining but the plot with the town council just doesn't seem believable or logical.With the force down to three people with one on light duty, it seems counterproductive to threaten Chief Stone over such petty matters. Oh well, what can you expect from politicians? We hope there are more movies coming. My wife and I really like the Jesse Stone movies, but this one is not as good as the rest, not really bad, just not on par with the rest.",
         "Tom Selleck's fifth go round as Robert B Parker's Jesse Stone, the emotionally wounded chief of police for Paradise Massachusetts a small hamlet not far from Boston. Sharing many of the same characters as the Spencer novels the stories and the films have a nice familiar feel while having their own unique style. This is the first film not to be based upon a Parker novel, though to be perfectly honest I think it would fit in nicely with the books. Stone, forever pining for his ex-wife is at the end of the road and perhaps as the story begins the end of his rope. One of the town fathers has it in for Stone because he's not playing ball. he is not using his men to write lucrative speeding tickets (and he's removed the best ticket writer the town had) nor is he willing to hire the man's son in law. The main thrust of the film is that Stone was involved in a shooting that left the head of the state police homicide squad, Captain Healy, (a cross over character from the Spencer novels) struggling for his life. Healy is a good friend of Stone's and he is not going to let the shooting rest, \"because I got shot as well\". From this shooting comes further complications as Stone becomes involved with an internal affairs cop investigating the shooting. Add to the mix there is also the appearance of a woman from New Mexico who is looking for her son who was abducted seven years earlier while still an infant and whom she believes maybe in Paradise. There is much going on and yet at times not a great deal since the film seems more interested in getting into the head of Selleck's Jesse Stone. A man of few words Stone says little preferring his actions to say more than his words. He is a very moral man (his battle with the town council makes that clear) adrift in a world with out morality.I know on some level I would have liked more details to the mysteries at hand, but at the same time I like that the film is a character driven tale. I like that you have to watch the film (and the other Stone films) because what is important isn't what is being said, its whats being done and what is happening between the words. There is a really good scene late in the film when Stone, knowing he is being watched, goes through a pantomime with one of his officers. What is being said runs at odds at how things look, it is something that sums up how the Stone films work.They draw you in and make you care because in order for them to work you have to pay attention to what the characters really are saying and doing. I liked the film a great deal. If you are a Jesse Stone fan you will like this as well. If you've not seen one before I think you'd like it as well. I'm sure, that you'll be like me and it will have you looking forward to the next one, due late in 2009.",
         "I just saw this after not paying close attention to TV listings months ago. At the start of this movie based on a Robert Parker novel, Chief Stone is on a stakeout with his friend Captain Healy, the Massachusetts head of homicide. The two are talking and not paying enough attention when someone shows up and shoots both of them. Stone, naturally, recovers, but Healy may not. Town councilman Carter Hanson wants to hire his nephew to replace D'Angelo, though what he really wants to do is get rid of Stone, whose reputation is hurting the town's image as a tourism destination. Eilzabeth Blue shows up wanting the Paradise police department to find her son who was kidnapped seven years ago. She has received a letter from Paradise suggesting her son may be alive in Paradise. Actually, she didn't see the letter for two years because her ex-husband hid it from her. Stone doesn't really want to investigate but Rose does. Stone's ex-wife Jenn, who does the weather on a Los Angeles TV station, calls to say she is moving in with her producer. Stone doesn't approve. His dog doesn't either, but I think the dog is reacting to Stone drinking again. Dr. Dix doesn't approve of much of anything Stone does, and one wonders where he's getting the nearly $200 he has to pay per hour. Jenn has talked to Dr. Dix, who won't reveal what she said. Sidney is Stone's latest girlfriend; she is investigating him for Internal Affairs after Stone shot his shooter, which is standard procedure. But she is also investigating him because he is \"on thin ice\" with the town council. Suitcase provides a critical clue in the Blue case. One would expect Stone to be so smart he'd see it, but I'm sure this makes Suitcase look good. Tom Selleck gives his usual fine performance. Even though Stone meets a new standard for unethical behavior, Selleck makes us like him. Actually, Stone is more moral than the town council on one issue. Stone doesn't seem to want to be liked except by his friends, but that doesn't matter. The lead actors all give good performances as well, and Camryn Mannheim stands out among the guest stars. Many of the guest actors also give good performances. Somehow I didn't enjoy this as much as other Jesse Stone movies, but it was still worthwhile.",
         "I love the feel of these (made for TV) movies. And as another person commented, I also like the music and how it adds to the atmosphere. This one had good attention to detail, I thought. At least, based on a couple of things I noticed. At the firing range Suitcase had a Bic four color pen in his breast pocket; when he was taking notes on his observation of the bad guy outside the bar, he used the same (sort of?) pen to write them. There were a few other little details like that - clearly, the people who put this together took good care with the film. And I continue to be impressed with how Tom Selleck portrays Jesse Stone. Tom might be older than Jesse, but he does a fantastic job. I'm sure that Robert B. Parker would have been happy.",
         "In addition to the problems stated in previous reviews, some of the dialog seems stripped (in its exact form) from previous episodes. Old characters that once provided meaning and added to mood now just seem like familiar on-screen forms. What was spare and inviting the first time around just seems lazy now. I think what is missing is a compelling story. And I really miss Molly. I like the characters and the setting so much that I was willing to watch Thin Ice but I would not have been encouraged to watch other episodes had this been my first contact with the series.",
         "Tom Selleck returns for a sixth time as chief Jesse Stone in Paradise. This time he's on the trail of who shot Captain Healy (Stephen McHattie) and himself one night while they were parked doing surveillance. Meanwhile a woman (a very compelling Camryn Manheim) from Albuquerque arrives clinging to a thread of hope about her missing son. Jesse prefers not to take the case but allows Rose (Kathy Baker) to take up the case herself. Simultaneously Captain Healy warns Jesse against pursuing the shooter, and the town council prepares to discipline Stone. Like the previous films, the story develops deliberately. Selleck is perfect in the title role as usual. The film touches on minor threads from previous story lines, like Luther's cognition, while maintaining its focus on the present. William Devane returns as Doctor Dix and Kerri Smith returns as Sister Mary John. This is the first film in the series with an original script not based on one of Robert B. Parker's novels. Once again Robert Harmon directs. The background music really does add a nice touch. I wonder if Leslie Hope's Sidney Greenstreet character is intended to be a joke for film buffs. **1/2 of 4 stars.",
         "... on its own this one in the series is good; different of course, but good. some changes are blatant of course, molly and d'angelo. but still has that small town, big city cop feel. it moves the series along just enough, without being silly or indulgent. parallels and parables still tag teaming in the storyline. which works well. i enjoy this series very much, it will eventually standup well against the test of other cop shows that have come before it. Selleck is great, and so is the whole cast, including the antagonistic others(city council). i'll sum up this series like this... after a long day its good to be cozy in ur favorite chair and sweats, flipping on the electronic device of choice and finding some new twist or beat that seemed not there before, and relishing it anew, once again.",
         "Thin Ice is the fifth Jesse Stone film, and the first that didn't come directly from one of Robert Parker's novels. Parker didn't write this one, but Thin Ice is still every bit as gripping and mysterious as the other Stone stories. Since becoming the police chief in Paradise, Massachusetts, Stone has injected himself into local business and politics, discovering a lot of corruption, and a connection to organized crime. He's done a tremendous job, but the town council is very upset with him. All these arrests and headlines have put Paradise on the front page, and it has taken it's toll on the towns main source of income, tourism. The town council tells Stone he has to tone it down or risk losing his job. In typical fashion he response by telling them, \"you can fire me, but you can't tell me what to do.\" An upset Stone, heads to Boston to have dinner with his friend, the state homicide commander, when a mysterious shooter tries to take them both out. Now Stone is in the middle of another headline grabbing investigation that's become personal. As always Tom Selleck is terrific and pairing him Picket Fences' Kathy Baker has only made the film series that much more enjoyable for me. Every film has two mysteries that feature Stone right in the middle of the action. Thin Ice being written by a different person, shows Stone as edgier and more sarcastic, something that was interesting to see. I've read most of the novels and know the character of Jesse Stone very well, and to see him exhibit different personality traits, in an extreme situation, really was a treat for me. If you're not familiar with Jesse Stone, you should take the time to do so. He is one of the most complex characters I have ever come across and he's played by the absolute perfect choice, Tom Selleck. The man has been playing a cop for nearly 40 years and has learned a thing or two about what it takes to lead audiences through an investigation. Thin Ice was definitely a change in direction, but it works, as even in it's fifth installment, Jesse Stone is still every bit as good as it ever was."
