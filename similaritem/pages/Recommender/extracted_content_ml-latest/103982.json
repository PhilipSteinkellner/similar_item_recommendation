         "content": "I guess one good thing one can say about this movie is that the producer had tried to make it a bit original. Unfortunately it did not work for me. I have never really liked these handy-cam movies where all the scenes are jumping around. This one tried to be a bit original in that it was simulating being made by an old-fashioned world war II film camera instead of a handy-cam. I am afraid that it did not really make it any better as far as I am concerned. It just added a few scrapes and the occasional end of the film reel effect every so often. Usually when something gory was about to happen.\n\nSpeaking of gory. The movie was not really that goory unless you count a lot of body parts being strewn around the scenes. Plenty of the, supposedly, gory parts was just silly, possibly supposed to be comical, but mostly just really silly. The part where the mad \u201cgenious\u201d was grafting to brain parts, one Nazi and one communist, together was just ludicrous and sad.\n\nThe blurb claims this was supposed to be Hitler\u2019s last ghastly attempt to win the war but in the movie it seemed little more than some crazy guys drug induced dream. The main adversary failed completely in projecting any form of \u201cgenius\u201d image and there certainly did not seem to be any support from the Nazi regime.\n\nTo make matters worse there was really not a single likable person in the movie. All the characters where either just filler characters, crazy people, real assholes or some mixture of said traits.\nI am afraid that I had to force myself to watch this movie to the end.",

         "The only difference between this found footage film and footage that may have actually been taken by a real Russian soldier is that the real Russian soldier probably would have been able to hold the camera without shaking it and would have kept it in focus. Enough of this found footage technique. If it brings nothing to the storyline, then it's not worth the pain of watching it. To me the filming technique was overbearing and outweighed anything the movie might have been. It is just annoying to watch. And again there is zero character depth or development, partly due to the filming technique. Alright, the monsters are great, good enough to rate all the five stars. If you want to see good monsters, then watch it. The acting is dodgy, the plot minimal, and you just won't care who gets gored because again there is no depth to the characters. If you're plain tired of found footage, give this one a pass.",
         "This was a movie that could have gone either way. The idea of it could have easily been executed a little tediously with a CGI created zombie army going around causing perturbation and despair. However, the good news is that Frankenstein's Army has been made by a team with a great deal of imagination. And this one should attain considerable cult value I reckon. The basic set-up for the story is typical enough in that this is a found footage movie. It has a group of Soviet soldiers entering Nazi Germany during the final days of the Second World War. They wind up at a dilapidated factory where they discover bizarre creatures that appear to be half human half machine. It's these monsters that are the real angle for this film. Named as zombots in the credits, these creations are extremely original in design. They have a definite steampunk styling and pleasingly each creature has a completely different look. Knives for hands, propeller-heads, head-crushing heads, stilts legs, face-drills�you name it, these monsters are nothing if not original in design. What makes it even better is that this is a movie with a lot of proper physical effects and costumes � it's not rammed to the gunnels with CGI effects. This ensures that the look is more convincing. The factory location has a suitably grungy feel too, which works well alongside the creatures. Things eventually move into the lair of the mad scientist Frankenstein. It's at this point we get to see some of his insane experiments, including combining half a Communist brain with half a Nazi one! Yeah, there is a lot of crazed imagination in this one. Surely there must be a sequel...Dracula's Army anyone?",
         "It took quite a while for Richard Raaphorst to have his first feature length film canned but now we can all enjoy \"Frankenstein's Army\", which debuted at the International Film Festival Rotterdam. The film had its world premiere at a sold out screening of the International Rotterdam Film Festival. And at long last the audience had the chance to have a look at Raaphorst's creation(s) in full splendour. I think a lot of horror fans have been looking forward to the debut of \"Frankenstein's Army\"; we've been teased by some excellent trailers of his \"Worst Case Scenario\" and when that project got stuck in development hell, artwork and teasers for his new film surfaced. In \"Frankenstein's Army\" everything's filmed from a first person perspective, that person being the soldier Sergei, who's part of a Russian squad that is slowly moving further in Germany. He has the task to document the march of Mother Russia into Germany. So yes, you've read it right: this is a found footage film. When the squadron goes further into the countryside some weird skeletons and soldiers are found. When they pick up a radio signal from some comrades the trail leads them to a church / factory and then shits starts to hit the propeller. The first half builds up slowly towards the second. Starting off with quite some shots of running and some occasional shooting, it gets more interesting when they come up a village where things don't seem right. The part where they start to encounter the first zombots (as Richard has named his creations) almost reminded me of a mix of the video game \"Return to Castle Wolfenstein\" and more steampunkish elements. Zombots suddenly appear and create havoc amongst the Russians. The second half steps down a bit and offers a better look at Raaphorst's monsters. The encounter of Viktor -the creator of the monstrous nazi soldiers- provides the director to go all out with special effects in the 'laboratory'. This is a place where a gorehound's heart starts beating faster: there are some geeky references, all the monsters and gory effects are real (so almost no computer effects) and that choice pays off. The effects feel real, the zombots are brought to life in a weirdly, wicked way, most of them wearing working mechanical features that gives each of them a unique look. Raaphorst reaps I was a bit thrown off because of this film being another one in the 'found footage' style. Even though it doesn't bring nothing new to this way of drawing the audience into the film, it is well done: you know you don't get these lame something-was-there-and-now-there-isn't kind of things but you will be treated with some in-your-face gore and great zombots. Also it was hard to get over the accents used by the actors throughout the film, that is always a hard choice to make. Raaphorst his strength is his vision, visuals and details. I expected the film to be a bit more sinister and dark because of the teasers but in the feature itself there is more focus on gore than tension. Luckily he knows his gore and all the effects are really well done. It's great to see his sketches come alive on the big screen and they work well in all their bizarre glory. I really hope this film will give Richard Raaphorst a chance to create another feature film in which he can explore more of his directional skills outside the found footage genre and is able to provide us another look in his bizarre, creative mind.",
         "I expected a low-rate B movie with maybe a few good scenes. I was very surprised with how well the film was put together. The story is simple: the Russian army is battling Germany during WW 2. They respond to a distress call put out by another Russian troop. When they get to the location they only find a hand full of Germans. I won't give away much of the plot except to say they that their expeditions lead them into a Nazi factory for making monsters run by none other than the monster-making maestro himself, Dr. Frankenstein. The monsters are good: kinda like more mechanized versions of those in Hellraiser, and the factory is like a weird mixture of Ed Gein meets Willy Wonka. The acting and dialog were also above average. I would overall characterize the movie as fun, not just the same rehashed Nazi experiment movie, and definitely worth a try",
         "During the World War II, a Russian troop in Germany receives a distress call in the radio from a group of Russian soldiers under siege by the Germans with the respective coordinates. The leader Sergeant Novikov (Robert Gwilym) decides to seek out the soldiers through the countryside of Germany. The soldier Dimitri (Alexander Mercury) is filming the troop to make a documentary and while they walk, they find weird bodies, slaughtered nuns in a convent burnt to the ground and open graves in a cemetery. They arrive at a deserted church where they meet a lethal army of undead with implanted weapons and tools. Soon they learn that the deranged but brilliant grandson of Dr. Viktor Frankenstein with the same name (Karel Roden) has a secret laboratory in the church and is responsible for those monstrosities. Further, they discover that their troop has been secretly assigned by the government to find and kill or bring the mad scientist to Moscow. \"Frankenstein's Army\" is a campy horror movie with a silly storyline for fans of trash and gore. The creatures are original and funny and there are entertaining and bloody situations. Unfortunately the option for the hand camera as if it were footage upsets me despite the good explanation for its use. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): \"O Exército das Trevas\" (\"The Army of the Darkness\")",
         "First and foremost, I rated this a 7/10 for creature design alone! They are truly unique and remarkable, even if the movie itself falls short. The acting is sub-par and there is no real character development at all. Some of the characters were so disgustingly horrible that I was begging for them to be taken out by the zombots immediately and all but cheered the moment they were. If you want to see some fantastic creature design, give this movie a try. My husband and I paused the movie several times just to take in the whole creature design aspect. It is entertaining enough from start to finish to warrant a viewing. It's not really thought provoking, but if you are looking for some mindless fun then give this flick a go!",
         "Toward the end of World War II, Russian soldiers pushing into eastern Germany stumble across a secret Nazi lab, one that has unearthed and begun experimenting with the journal of one Dr. Victor Frankenstein. This film comes from a very great starting point -- the idea that Nazis would use mad scientists to do terrible experiments on cadavers. That much is more or less true. Then, to make it horror and not just history, you add in the journal of Dr. Frankenstein. That is a purely genius decision. Even more bonus points for putting the story from the Russian point of view (the group that actually reached Germany) rather than the American, as would be more common. The creature design deserves top marks. If this was eligible for a costume Oscar, I think it would be a shoo-in. The creatures are some of the most incredible I have ever seen. Sort of like a steampunk Castle Wolfenstein (which seems to have clearly been an inspiration, with this coming across much like a first-person shooter). The overall set design is pretty great, too. In fact, my whole positive rating revolves around the design aspect, because I would be much more comfortable panning it based on the aspects I greatly disliked. All of these things revolve around the camera -- why was it shot hand-held when it would look better shot normally? How plausible is it that a Russian army team would be filming? Did cameras at that time film that well and not need changing every five minutes? How does the camera -- and its operator -- take such a beating? So basically, if they had replaced the point-of-view camera with a traditional camera, and scrapped the Blair Witch-meets-Wolfenstein video game thing they had going on, this could have been one of the better horror films out there today. Coming from Dark Sky, a company I love, I am disappointed it did not pass muster. And, despite the positive rating, I cannot truly recommend it. You really have to see the design, but I would rather not say you have to see the film. Better Nazi horror films exist (from \"Shock Waves\" to \"Dead Snow\"). I do look forward to whatever these creature designers do next, though.",
         "\"Frankenstein's Army\" is a visual feast of bizarre creatures and creepy set design. A WWII-era Russian army troop stumbles upon a demented, diabolical Nazi project. It's a simple enough premise; the true charm of the film is its creative character design. As the troop gradually explores the underground complex, we are treated to a pantheon of bizarre, highly-detailed monsters. We catch glimpses of... things... which raise more questions than answers, and it just keeps getting weirder and weirder! The use of actual, physical creatures, rather than CGI models, gives the film a shocking realism which is sorely lacking in modern horror/sci-fi. The found-footage aspect works in the film's favor. The first-person perspective draws the viewer into the action; at times, it feels like a survival-horror game. The cinematography is competent and each shot is carefully directed. Often there are creatures lurking at the edges of the frame, adding to the overall feeling of chaos and insanity. I enjoyed the hell out of this film and will definitely watch it again. It's twisted, highly creative, and FILLED with bizarre monstrosities. The actors all did a great job too, their reactions were natural and well-played. I look forward to future projects from Richard Raaphorst. Bravo, sir!",
         "I went to see this movie with minimum expectation: to be entertained by nice monsters, ass- kicking fights and a minimum of story. I did get nice monsters, but that is all. The plot is pretty much inexistent, which would be OK if the action was entertaining but it's just... not. First, the \"found footage\" thing... I know, this is not real life, but Russian soldier in WWII didn't have color camera with integrated microphone. it just makes the action harder to see because you only have one point of view at a time. It can be interesting, but not here The people are just... there. there is nothing really to make you care about them, so you don't. The movie is really slow so there was time for more, but instead you just watch them walking in a forest, walking in a village, walking with monsters walking around. Cause yeah. you'd think they would fight those monsters, but they don't. sometime the monsters attack then disappear, sometime they don't even bother and are just there. And then, you meet the \"doctor\" responsible for those creature and hear his motivation and you think \"well why wasn't that the beginning of the movie\" and then everything blow up and you feel like you just lost too many minutes of your life for a shitty movie.",
         "Another Nazi weird science and hand-held camera movie. So fasten your seat-belts! There's gonna to be a whole lotta shaking going on. This one follows an undisciplined and sometimes comical Russian reconnaissance team as they march, hike, and yeah, stagger and stumble thru German territory trying to get the goods on the Germans for mother Russia. As they progress, they encounter evidence that later becomes horrifying fact that the Nazis are trying to advance there cause with some seriously f!!cked-up science: the re-animation and mechanical weaponization of the dead. This, Reader, you gotta see. Every kind of scrap, junk or part is imaginatively used in the reconstruction and re-animation of the dead. Now while horrifying, there is also no escaping the comical effect of this. This movie is only scary in the sense that \"bizarre killer robots\" are after you. It is not scary in traditional creepy and supernatural sense of the dead coming back to life. 2 reasons: The merging of people with metal and mechanical parts \"dehumanizes\" them you tend to think of them more as \"machines\". As well, this movie leans towards being an over-the-top dark horror comedy; especially at the end. Normally I don't like hand-held camera movies or \"jerky-cams\" as I think of them. However there are exceptions and this is one of them. There is a \"real-life or documentary voyeur effect\" to these types of movies which is chiefly what distinguishes them (along with the jitters, of course). As well, since the camera person is a character in the movie, it always amuses me that when all hell breaks loose and everyone is scattering and running for dear life, they have to hold there ground and act like the bravest or most reckless person in the world and continue filming or else there's no movie. Sometimes the makers of this type of movie get creative and have the person drop the camera in the excitement of the moment; but note that the camera never stops working and always lands in a position where it can continue filming the action. You gotta love it. Boloxxxi."
