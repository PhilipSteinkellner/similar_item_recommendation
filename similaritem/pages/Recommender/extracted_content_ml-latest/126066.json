         "It's Halloween and we are at the home of \"Witch Hazel\" who proudly displays her \"diploma\" on the wall which reads, \"Malevolent Order of Witches - A. F. of Elves.\" The first thing you notice is the great artwork: cool drawings of the inside of the house and great colors. These restoration jobs on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection DVDs are tremendous. Bugs is out trick-or-treating and, of course, stops at Hazel's house. Bugs is wearing a witch's mask, too. Bugs asks the \"lady\" if she has anything for a \"little witch.\" Hmmm, thinks Hazel, \"I don't remember seeing her at any of the union meetings.\" Hazel winds up thinking the visitor is so little and ugly - which is a compliment. She winds up trying to find out Bugs' secret to being so ugly. The humorous dialog making ugly the ideal and beauty the opposite, Hazel then discovering it's not another witch but a rabbit and how she reacts......and those wild colors all make this a lot of fun to watch. It's another Bugs Bunny winner.",
         "\"Broom-Stick Bunny\" is a memorable Warner Bros. cartoon not for the presence of Bugs Bunny but rather for the presence of Witch Hazel, wonderfully voiced by June Foray. Hazel manages to steal all the laughs away from Bugs, and her best moments occur with her hysterical laugh, matched with some wild gyrations and ubiquitous bobby pins. She also sings her own fractured version of \"A Cup of Coffee, a Sandwich, and You\" at the opening of this short. As for that wabbit, it seems as if the Bugs Bunny of the mid-1950s, especially in films directed by Chuck Jones, is quite polished and refined compared to the more prankish 1940s Bugs. As a result, Bugs may at times not be quite as funny as he was a decade earlier, and such is the case with \"Broom-Stick Bunny.\" This is not to say that Chuck Jones was an inferior director. Quite the contrary; Jones deserves a great deal of respect for all that he did for the Warner Bros. cartoon department. Check out \"Broom-Stick Bunny\" on Disc 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2. And for an added treat, listen to June Foray's audio commentary about her experience as a Warner Bros. cartoon voice artist.",
         "Witch Hazel is simply delighted to be the ugliest witch ever as told to her by her magic mirror. That is until Bugs Bunny shows up trick-or-treating. The mirror mistaking the rabbit's mask for his real face soon rescinds the title that he gave Hazel as ugliest and bestows it on Bugs. Which of course infuriates Hazel to no end. This is another great Looney Tunes short, and while I was never the biggest fan of Witch Hazel, this is one of the best cartoons with her in it. This animated short can be seen on Disc 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2. It also features an optional commentary by legendary voice actress June Foray who seems to remember quite a lot. Plus, the short has a musical score and effects only track as well. My Grade: B+",
         "***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Broomstick Bunny starts as a chase short set on Halloween with a clever angle; Witch Hazel, who abhors being beautiful, is shocked when another witch (Bugs Bunny trick-or-treating) appears who is even more hideous than her. Hazel tries to feed the witch tea drugged with beautifying potions, but Bugs has to take off his mask first - which causes Hazel to remember a key ingredient in the potion she is mixing. But Chuck Jones makes this short immortal with a stunning turn of events. Hazel is about to chop Bugs' head off, but we are suddenly treated to a totally unexpected reaction - genuine tears of fright by Bugs. Hazel, seeing the humanity in Bugs' tears, suddenly can't go through with it, as Bugs suddenly reminds her of her beloved pet who is no longer with her. The comedic punchline then comes when Bugs gives Hazel tea to calm her down - both forgetting it is the beautifying tea that leads to a hilarious aerial chase and Bugs' bemused warning to air-raid HQ.",
         "I agree with the preceding poster: those tears are genuinely moving. We all know Bugs as a trickster, a heckler and a very smart guy who outwits anyone who tries to encroach on his life, but to know him as someone who could actually be frightened for once...wow!!! A silly 7 minute cartoon and yet I still cry when I see that scene. Even Witch Hazel, who is about to murder the bunny with a huge ax so she can mix him into her caldron, begins to cry!!! Thankfully, the heavy emotions go pouf!!! when Bugs tries to comfort the weeping hag with the tea she made. She turns into a hottie witch and the Magic Mirror Man goes after her with lust!!! A real classic!!!",
         "This episode has a good mix of Bugs's antics. Bugs Bunny suffers some indignities and a close shave with death but comes out on top and has the closing one-liner. The graphics and copy which flash through the episode are hilarious, but easy to miss, starting with Witch Hazel's certificate guaranteeing her identity as a witch and upstanding membership, and which later accords with her comment that she hasn't seen Bugs Bunny, in disguise, at any of the \"union meetings\". The reason for the chase and attempted murder of Bugs, all comes down to the witch's Recipe 102, which demands inter alia, swamp water steeped in a skull, a cup of arsenic, diced spider, hornet's heel (3), and a rabbit's clavicle, not foot. Witch Hazel was perfectly willing to co-exist with Bugs, trying to wheedle out his secrets of ugliness, and with attempted reversal of ugliness by a witch's spell, but after all, all's fair in love and witchcraft. It is only that outlandish recipe requirement that leads to the mayhem. Witch Hazel is a fantastically ugly creature � down to her bulbous nose, the tip of which often creases as it weighs down upon her prominent chin � but you have to study her face. Her self-conscious laughter at her own running comments is another fine aspect of this episode. For example, after sharpening the knife with which to kill Bugs, she touches the blade, notes that it is \"Sharp enough to split a hare\". It is not an original pun, but she thinks that it is and then has another giggling frenzy before darting away, leaving a further trail of hair pins in her wake. Bugs Bunny has frequently had close shaves with death. I'd vote that his tears in this episode were a pre-meditated ruse, even if he were sympathetic and supplied, unknown to him, the 'poisoned' tea to Hazel.",
         "To summarise, this short is creepy and fun, and incidentally my personal favourite of the cartoons starring Witch Hazel. The animation here is stunning, and the story is top notch too. Bugs is still great, but it is Hazel who steals the show, her voice, her laugh, her mannerisms are all enough to make her truly memorable. The script is fine, but the sight gags are better I think, with a wonderful(and hilarious) ending. Also the part when Bugs tears up causing Hazel to cry as well almost made me do so too, Bugs's expression was so cute. Mel Blanc excels as always as Bugs, but June Foray steals the show with a bravura vocal performance as Witch Hazel. Overall, really fun to watch. 10/10 Bethany Cox",
         "This is a great cartoon for Halloween and I love it and I'm really (and I mean really) into witches. I like it when Bugs gave Witch Hazel the \"puppy-eyes\"; and also, when he hands her a cup of tea to cheer Hazel up (which is really a beauty potion) and she turns a beautiful woman, and did you all know that Witch Hazel's voice actress June Foray was the model for \"beautiful\" Witch Hazel? I heard it on the audio commentary for this cartoon on Looney Tunes Golden Collection - Volume #2. I also would like to point out,that there is another Witch Hazel in the 1952 Donald Duck cartoon \"Trick or Treat.\"",
         "From its first minute, this episode might seem a little bit too cliché and a little bit too boring, yet this episode proves to be a very memorable, entertaining one. This episode has fantastic animation, quotes, laughs and plot turns. It also has an ABSOLUTELY HIDEOUS witch! Bugs Bunny is trick-or-treating and he happens to arrive in the house of a REAL witch. She invites Bugs Bunny in for tea - thinking that he is actually a witch. The tables begin to turn... This may not be the most rip-roaring Bugs Bunny episode, in fact some might go even so far as to say it is \"dead boring\". However, if you look past the slightly slow plot, you will see that this is an episode well worth watching! :-) This includes one of my favourite Looney Tunes quotes: Bugs Bunny: (Having just met the witch) She isn't pretty now, but she was someone's baby once. I recommend this cartoon to anyone who likes Bugs Bunny and for anyone who likes funny Halloween things. Enjoy! :-)",
         "One of the great things about the Looney Tunes cartoons was how they put spins on the real world and popular culture. They do that in \"Broom-Stick Bunny\", as perpetually cackling Witch Hazel gets all vain about being the ugliest witch of all, and finds that another witch (actually Bugs Bunny in his Halloween costume) is uglier. So, she sets - or rather flies - about trying to get him. But Bugs has his own plans, natch. Most likely involving Hazel's mirror (hint: this mirror is supposed to say that Hazel is the ugliest of all). So, this might not be the best Looney Tunes cartoon ever, but it's a real pleasure to watch. Mel Blanc and June Foray are a great voice combo."
