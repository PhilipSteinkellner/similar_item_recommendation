         "Available in the Midnight Horror Collection from Echo Bridge called Backwoods Butchers, Butchered was decent viewing. Although obviously shot on an extremely low budget,there are a few decent moments to be found here. The opening scene, culminating in an homage (or steal) of a scene found in Exorcist III, built up fair tension and the montage/opening credits looked pretty professional. But the wooden acting from most of the young cast and the lack of originality in the killings brings the movie down big time in my opinion. Practically everyone was dispatched with an axe to the chest, it got repetitive. I wanted to be kind to this independent horror film, but it just has too many faults. I do respect the fact that the makers are obviously inspired by stronger horror film, but it's a shame that this one didn't turn out too strong.",
         "The tag-line says \"It's in the vein of classic horror\". I guess so, if you took all the great 80's slasher flicks and condensed them to an hour. The premise is the usual, partying teens trapped on an island with an escaped serial killer, insert nude girl here and flying axe there and you've basically seen the movie. It's unbelievably short, clocking in at about 1h18min. The entire movie could have been cut down to 45 minutes if you cut out the opening credits and scenes of them partying in slow motion. The movie was pretty much bloodless and unsuspenseful. If they took out the nudity and the profanity, it probably would have gotten a PG rating. So, if you have about an hour to kill (no pun intended), go ahead and take a look. If anything to laugh at the cliché factor.",
         "Being an Avid Fan of Horror movies, I had high hopes of this film - Sadly, those hopes were dashed. Quickly. I was expecting this horror/thriller film that was worthy of being a big part of my library, and now I know it will never be. I'm expecting a Horror Film that actually scares you. Instead, I got bad acting and a weak storyline. This is NOT what makes a great horror movie. Granted, Most horror movies do have cheesy dialog at times, but the good ones don't have the cheesy dialog all the way through. Another issue I have is with the horror scenes - There is nothing wrong with a little gore in some death scenes, let alone a special effect or two. *POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT* And I'm pretty sure there is a TON of voice-over work in the latter part of the film, more then usual. If there is only one thing to take from this movie, it's the fact that this movie serves as a baseline as to what you don't do when you are making a horror film. This movie is NOT worth the time.",
         "Butchered (2010) What we have here is an old school horror flick that could have been made after John Carpenter's Halloween put scarepics back in as Big Business again, but before Tom Savini brought on the graphic violence in Friday the 13th (1980). The story gets going with the convicted murderer called The Butcher escaping custody and picking up right where he left off. And by picking up, I mean as in sharp implements he puts to bloody use. In the meantime, while he's dodging the police and picking off a couple of victims, we meet our leads, seven high school students just graduated and about to go their separate ways. To celebrate their friendship they boat out to an island just offshore for a weekend of partying they hope will forever stay in their memories. Unfortunately for them, the Butcher just landed his stolen boat on the other side of the island, and when he gets through with them, there might just be nothing left of them but memories. All in all, this one shapes up as not bad. It's obvious this was a very low budget affair, but it moves along, clocking in at a spare 71 minutes. Probably the biggest problem I have with the film is not in its production, but in the marketing. Calling the film Butchered and touting it as unrated on the box sets up expectations that are not so much not carried through as I'm guessing not ever planned for. Quite simply, the direction, credited to Charles Stewart, Jr, co-writer/producer Sheila Brothers, and co-writer/producer/actor Shaun O'Rourke doesn't dwell on the kills. They are quick, snappy sequences more interested in eliciting a jump from the audience than a grab for the barf bag. There are some gruesome moments, but the movie doesn't shove them in your face and linger on the blood and guts, which is why it seems so much like a movie made 30 years ago. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. Without going into spoilers, the body count is a respectable double digit number, and I'm not counting the victims the Butcher killed to get his nickname or the murdered police dog everyone seems to mention a lot. I think the film is unrated because it wasn't submitted to the ratings board, not because it is the ne plus ultra of extreme gore and sex. Speaking of sex, we do get a couple of nice nude scenes sprinkled in, always a plus in this kind of endeavor. I would call this a solid R based on the violence, nudity, and language. Breaking it down, the film looks very nice, with crisp cinematography and gorgeous seaside locations; the script is decent, with some funny lines, if no game changing twists or turns; the acting is okay, although sadly the better actors stay on shore instead of going to the island; and always important - the killer: The Butcher is a big brute of a guy, at his best in the night scenes, framed in fog with his big ol' axe; and losing some of his scary mojo in the last few scenes as we see him a bit too well. This isn't the best horror film you'll ever see, and I'd guarantee it isn't the worst one either. It's worth a look for those so inclined, so check it out! Starring Tim Woodward Jr, Melissa Lukon, Shaun O'Rourke, Cari Moskow, and DJ Naylor as The Butcher.",
         "\"Butchered\" is a neatly packed, burst of low-budget slasher horror directed by Charles Stewart Jr. with co-directors Sheila Brothers and Shaun O'Rourke. Honestly I hope those are more honorary co-directing credits, because I don't see why a film that falls just over an hour really needs multiple directors, but whateve. That is no issue really. \"Butchered\"stars the standard cast of characters played by Timothy Woodward Jr., Nikki Beall, Cory Broadwater, Robert Covington, Kit Johnson, D.J. Naylor, Jaime Moffett, plus a few other actors in a story that follows a group of friends, who take off on vacay to a small secluded island, off the coast of the Carolinas. The story is a nice, classic nightmare of slasher fanfare that places the young up against the force of a homicidal psycho, butcher. The set- up is thought out, leading us through a nice, \"all fall down\" scenario that, considering the budget and talent, manages to create an easy, story arc. The dialog is a bit underwhelming, and melodramatic, but it gets you there fundamentally. Personally I think the writing is too \"over-thought\" with the material seeming cliché and unauthentic. However this is only a slight hindrance and nothing that effects the ability to watch the film. Some characters are more driven to emote the stories intentions while a couple stagger through the lines and scenes systematically. Still this is a \"slice-n-dice\" flick so all they need to do is be there and die for the camera. This they definitely do. The acting is the quality you would expect in a low-budget flick like this, like I stated before some actors give a better performance than others. The actual dialog and character development is sort of weak, often creating disconnected and unconvincing performances. Still there are moments when the acting and dramatic character interactions pick-up and deliver, giving us some suspense and enough connection to move the story along. The actual story is a pretty nice \"birth of a slasher\" narrative with recognizable 80 slasher influence. As for the special effects and sound effects in \"Butchered\" I am split on both. The music and instrumental created the desired effect that Stewart was aiming for, my issue is I felt it was hokey, white-washed and too damn sugary. Plus the timing for these elements coming in to the scenes, guiding the feeling of the story, often seemed \"over produced\" and a bit too clichéd. It created an unintended cheese factor that came off more Disney than horror. The special effects on the other hand worked for most of the kill scenes, with nice camera angles, little editing tricks that leave the gore implied, like the vintage horror films used, give credibility to the scenes. The blood and visceral elements are practical effects. They are limited with most deaths and brutality implied, but enough shows to create a nice effect. The killer is a menacing monster guy with the stoic brutality of any antagonist in slasher horror. I know it sounds like I didn't like the film but I did, actually. It isn't anything special but for a cut-down film that is only a few minutes over an hour, \"Butchered\" gives a comparable, quick, slasher nightmare.",
         "While most might argue that the Butcher was a terrible movie, I try to find the positive side of the light. While they weren't laying any new mile stones for the horror genre they did have a good back story to the main character. I liked the idea that he was a Desert Storm Vet who went nuts, but I would have liked it a lot more had they made him a little less \"big and dumb.\" In the beginning we see a great montage of torture and gore, but when push comes to shove all he does is hack up the characters on the island. Why didn't he torture them? Why didn't he make things out of their bodies? Some butcher. There are a couple of nice nudity scenes in the film, hot chicks, okay dialogue, nice cinematography and editing. 71 minutes made it just barely a feature, why they couldn't have filmed another 20 minutes of footage is beyond me. It could have been a masterpiece of indie horror but they just didn't get all the way to the finish line.",
         "The quote in the review's subject is the actual tagline for this 2010 straight-to-video horror quickie poetically entitled �\"Butchered\". Hmm, I guess someone confused classic horror with amateur nonsense. Yes I'm looking at you Mr. and Mrs. Writers/Co-directors! But then again, you honestly can't be too harsh in your criticism because basically they only had the modest ambition to make a very straightforward and rudimentary slasher picture to bring homage to all the trash released during the glorious 1980's. \"Butchered\" is a (barely) 70 minutes long series of ancient clichés, usual stereotypes and a whole lot of predictable situations. Somewhere in a quiet harbor town in North Carolina � of all places - there's a deranged axe-wielding serial killer on the lam. His name is Terence Skinner and he used to work in the butcher shop of his parents, but then went bonkers after his return from the Gulf war and massacred more than 40 people. Or at least that's what the journalist explains during the opening credits, which have some pretty cool musical guidance as well. In the nearby town, a handful of teenagers decide to spend one last weekend partying together before they head off for college. They go to a little island to camp and have random sex, but guess who they bump into there! All the potboiler elements that you except to see are well-presented: campfire stories, mobile phones without a signal, people stupidly splitting up to search missing friends and agonizing dialogs like \"Oh my God, we're so going to die!!\". \"No, shut up, we're not going to die!\". In good old 80's tradition, you can also immediately predict the order in which the teenagers are going to knocked off. Starting with the cute looking but redundant random girls, onwards to the sex-obsessed dumb friend and then quickly towards the loyal black guy and his girlfriend. The gore and the killings are disappointingly lame and monotonous. We're talking mainly about swinging and flying axes, but we aren't seeing the actual impact. Terence Skinner is a boring and unimaginative killer without any sort of charisma or \"specialty\". There's one sequence in which his silhouette stands motionless amidst the trees and covered in fog. I rather liked that sight because it promptly reminded me of \"Madman\" and that's a personal favorite (better call it \"guilty pleasure\") of mine. \"Butchered\" is available on a cheap disc together with three other masterpieces of amateur horror, so if you pick up a DVD like that at Walmart, you pretty much know what to expect.",
         "A group of college kids having one last party on a secluded island before departing one another to different jobs & cities, encounters an unwelcome guest at their party, when an escaped maniac decides to crash their party & hack them up with an axe. BUTCHERED is a film I saw under Echo Bridge Entertainment's \"MIDNIGHT HORROR COLLECTION: BACKWOODS BUTCHERS\" banner, the version I saw boasted that it was the \"Unrated Version\" which left me scratching my head by the time the film was over, because I was wondering what the R-rated cut contained, the Unrated Cut features hardly any blood or gore whatsoever, just a few sprays on blood here & there, as well as some nudity, so what does the R-rated cut contain? The beginning & end credits only? The films acting is not to bad for a low budget, direct to DVD horror picture & the directing is reasonably passive. Another big plus is the films attractive cast & interesting villain with a back story. The kills are okay, but again due to lack of coin or the film-makers decisions to not show any gore, they are not very spectacular & will likely disappoint most gore & horror fans. The film is brief, clocking in at 71 minutes & that's a shame, because the film has plenty of interesting & well drawn out characters & situations. The downside is however, that the kids arrive at the island about midway & most of the kills & stalk sequences are set in the daylight, with about ten minutes of it set at night & I felt that robbed the film of the suspense, atmosphere & scares it could have had, had it staged all it's kills & murders entirely at night. The films first half also wastes to much time on the back story for the lead hero & his family problems, which he talks about to his girlfriend, his brother, his friend & which his brother talks to his friend who works with him on the fishing pier & I felt a lot of this exposition could have been written around & more scenes added to the kids on the island trying to escape the maniac. The ending also leaves a set-up for a sequel, which if one does get made, hopefully goes on longer & corrects the mistakes it did make here. All in all, BUTCHERED is definitely worth the watch, it's not the greatest slasher ever made, but it is made with a sense of fun & should do the trick if you want to see a decent, non bloody horror flick to pass the time. ***1/2 stars",
         "A bunch of high school seniors go to a secluded island to party prior to heading off to college. The kids run afoul of a vicious axe-brandishing psycho Gulf War veteran known as the Butcher (an effectively menacing portrayal by hulking behemoth D.J. Naylor). Directors Charles Stweart, Jr., Sheila Brothers, and Shaun O'Rourke relate the familiar, but still engrossing story at a constant brisk pace, develop a good deal of tension, present characters who are both well drawn and sympathetic, deliver a fair amount of graphic gore, and sprinkle a decent dab of tasty gratuitous female nudity for good measure. The competent acting from the solid no-name cast rates as another big plus, with especially praiseworthy contributions by Tim Woodward, Jr. as the willful, conflicted Dylan, Melissa Lukon as the sweet Jenna, Kristina Sipes as the perky Hope, Shaun O'Rourke as Dylan's regretful older brother Brody, and Kit Johnson as hot brunette babe Chloe. Joseph Colyer's sharp cinematography gives this picture an impressive polished look. The lively and rattling score by Tommy Brothers and Jack Bowden Faulker hits the stirring'n'shivery spot. Moreover, the tight 71 minute running time ensures that this movie never becomes dull or overstays its welcome. A worthwhile little slice'n'dice opus."
