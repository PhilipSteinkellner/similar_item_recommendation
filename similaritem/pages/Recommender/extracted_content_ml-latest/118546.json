         "Ovidio (Joe Dallesandro) and his 2 friends work together at a computer company. Gradually they start going insane because of the routine everyday life within a rotten society and the effect of computers. Their frustrations and oppression they have gone though make them start killing random people, including a prostitute and her pimp, a taxi driver and eventually Ovidio's own wife. This is a really demented film but incredibly well-made and original. The social commentary really works in this film. The three young men seem to be killing random people for no reason although they certainly have a motive. SAVAGE THREE describes a situation that rarely happens in real life but anything is possible right? There is plenty of violence and gore here but there seems to be a good excuse for all this mayhem to take place so in my opinion it is fully justified. The upbeat, progressive hard rock score by Franco Campanino (THE CLIMBER) is a winner. I'm not sure as if SAVAGE THREE can be categorized as a standard Italian crime film as it avoids the expected bank robberies and car-chases, but it will definitely appeal to fans of the genre, specially to the ones with a taste for sleaze. A really special obscurity that deserves wider recognition.",
         "The Savage Three are three young men, fresh into the world, who work together at a computer analysis company. All three appear to be calm, level-headed, well-educated young men with the world at their fingertips. They are best friends, working together by day & playfully carousing at night. Dominating their carousing is Ovidio Mainardi, played by the handsome Joe Dallesandro. Ovid is married to a beautiful woman who is never home - she is a doctor who has put her career ahead of her marriage. As Ovid wiles away his days in front of a computer, doing repetitive, monotonous computations, he constantly glances at white mice kept trapped in a glass cage in the facility in which he works. He watches the mice as they trample each other wildly; he begins to ponder his own inner feelings of entrapment. His own frustration at being in a loveless marriage and monotone job boils over into lawlessness when he and his buddies cross the line from carousing to crime. Fango Bollente, also known as Savage Three and Hot Mud, follows these three handsome, young men through the busy streets of downtown Rome as they act out their frustrations in raw acts of violence. This Italian film is a treat for any Joe Dallensandro fan - he is completely unlikable as the complacently conniving & cruel Ovidio. This film is available in its original English soundtrack."
