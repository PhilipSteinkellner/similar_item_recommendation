Three years go by, and Emily is lost deep in the forest. Cold, frightened and alone in the darkness, she falls and is knocked unconscious. When she awakens, Emily is amazed to see that a brown bear has kept her warm and dry all night by cuddling her. It's Masha \u2013 and Emily is overjoyed to be reunited with the bear just when she needs a friend most. Together the two bravely set off on an adventure to find their way home. Bear With Me is a tale the whole family will find as exciting as it is heart-warming . . . and the magnificent forests of the Pacific Northwest lend this story of loyalty, friendship and adventure a magic all its own.",

But all in all, I'd say this is a must-see. If nothing for the climactic and symbolic tearing down of the tree fort and the lovely rendition of some nameless song that Emily sings into her portable recorder machine to illustrate the power, the utter spiritual enlightenment being soul mates with a bear brings."],
