Spectacular entertainment for the audience with Ajith performance backed up Glamour girls Simran & Jothika. Music is so big plus point even though most of the tunes were copied from English albums. The movie re-made in Hindi with Neha Dupia in Double was a bull ----, it really corrupted the image of the original movie. A must watch movie for all audience, don't miss it, one of the movie made based on ancient story with a new way."],

Priya, coincidentally, was also the girl Deva was interested in, but never got around to expressing his liking to. The new bride finds an inconvenient tension once she moves in with the two brothers. The title reflects the tale from the Ramayana epic, in which Vaali, the elder twin of Sugreeva, fell in love with his younger brother's wife.",
