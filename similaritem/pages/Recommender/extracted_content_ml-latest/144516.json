         "I'm a fan Asian horror movies and thrillers, I always check out new releases. The Brain Man is one of those movies that are based on novels or manga that is as I noticed the trend now in Japanese flicks. There have been lesser Japanese horror films being released that the country is commonly known for, but instead more thrillers are being made (reminds me of a lot of great South Korean thrillers). That is just my observation, by the way. If they're producing these thrillers, fans would expect Japan to do it better or at least as good as those of South Korea. The Brain Man is not a disappointment. It's slow-paced but the build-up is great. The story is very intriguing and I liked it a lot. It is more of a mystery indeed, but there are a lot of explosions (literal), murder, and cops here so this would qualify as a thriller. There are also a few count of psychos here to complete the story. The so-called Brain Man's character is incredibly acted by Toma Ikuta. Others are good actors as well. Enough said. I recommend not reading the plot or watching the subtitled trailer beforehand for a pleasant surprise. The time I watched this, I also watched after a movie called Platinum Data, which is another Japanese thriller. That time I was having a damn good time. Both are great films! I recommend watching this excellent flick, and Platinum Data too, but not Miike's Shield of Straw. Hoping to see more movies like these from Japan. Plus more horror movies!",
         "A super-smart bomber is blowing up people in Japan. Or maybe the bomber only appears so smart because the pursuing cop is so stupid. (spoilers now but no ending spoilers:) Suppose you're a cop, but you're real stupid. When offered 2 choices, which of the following would you choose:? Early on, another cop narrows the possible list of bombers to only a few. Would you bring a squad of other cops with you to interview these few suspects or would you show up with just your partner? If someone is about to shoot the bomber before they escape, would you let the bomber get shot, or would you fight the shooter before he can shoot? Suppose you need the immediate help of the bomb squad. At the same time, you discover the bomb squad is in a room with a hidden bomb that will blow up in seconds. Do you call them and say, \"Get out now!\" or do you have a long, drawn out conversation with them? That said, I still gave this movie a \"5\" because the guy with no feelings was interesting and because of the twist at the end concerning what the psychologist has learned after all the evidence is presented.",
         "\"The Brain Man\" is a highly entertaining movie, that it's at its best when it centers on the relationship between its two principal characters, but is a tad overlong and overplays its 'crazy people' card. There seems to be a serial killer on the loose. The police is trying to find the person, and they think they have him when, after some inquiries, they detain Ichiro Suzuki. But what seems like an accomplice has been able to run away. Doctor Mariko Washiya is called by the police to try to help uncover the puzzle that Ichiro Suzuki is. The movie centers on the relationship that builds between Ichiro and Mariko, the second a psychiatrist that believes in the possibility of change within people and that wants to find what made Ichiro the kind of person he is. And while researching for Ichiro's past and developing relationships, the movie is a fascinating study on human psychology. However, the 'psychokiller' card is overplayed in more than one occasion, with deaths and explosions just there to shock the viewer. It is a movie worth watching, and even if it's more than two hours long, it feels fresh and the running time only starts to feel stretched close to the end. The direction and acting help a lot, with lots of familiar Japanese movie/TV dramas faces that do a great job with their characters. If it just hadn't gone for the shock so much..."
