         "it is a very good movie with good actresses there is a lot of humor in the film. on the other hand it is also a very sad movie no downsides to this film, he is much better than the first movie goosiche women hope that a third will have it deserves Linda de Mol Lies Vissecherdijk Susan Visser Tjtiske Reidinga great It was truly enjoy I advise everyone to really these film watch for young and old no matter he is fun for all ages in length of the film is also good the camera work and the music fits the film Friendship is the most important in the film that I find is good that paid attention to this There are many scenes like where you lots of laughs",
         "I have seen the series and the last movies. To understand the relationships the characters and the jokes, you have to be Dutch or understand the Dutch sense of humour and language. I loved it and I loved seeing the ladies back together. The movie had a many fun moments and even the sad ones were funny. It felt like seeing an old and lost friend again. It's a nice movie for some mindless fun! Probably not so much for people who don't know the characters, the background and understand Dutch. But I had a great Sunday afternoon. Sit back, relax and enjoy!! It's a real girlie movie about friendship, love, marriage, death, betrayal and trust."
