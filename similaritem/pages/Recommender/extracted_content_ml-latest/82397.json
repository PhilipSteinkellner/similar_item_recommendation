         "The Last Summer of La Boyita (2009) is the U.S. title of this film from Argentina. The original version of the title is El último verano de la Boyita. It's written and directed by Julia Solomonoff This is a powerful movie for several reasons. It's a coming of age film, and it's a film about the significance of being considered male vs. female. Assigning gender is of great importance in any culture. It's of enormous significance in a rural Latin American culture. Guadalupe Alonso plays a young city girl, Jorgelina, whose family has a working ranch to which they go for vacation. Nicolás Treise plays Mario--a kind, gentle young man who works on the ranch and rides horses amazingly well. The relationship between Jorgelina and Mario forms the basis of the plot, and it would better to urge you to see the film, rather than to have me give more details. The acting overall is excellent, and the two leads are outstanding. How director Solomonoff obtained such subtle acting from two non-professionals is beyond my grasp. However, she did it. A third powerful aspect of this movie is its sense of place--the Pampas of Argentina. That virtue of the film will be partially lost on the small screen, unfortunately. We saw the movie in the Dryden Theatre at the outstanding ImageOut, the Rochester Lesbian & Gay Film Festival.",
         "La boyita deals with a sensitive subject with noblesse oblige. Jorgelina, a nine year old girl who is just as annoying to her older sister as my sister was to me at times, also encapsulates the contradictions of life that enable her to be at the same time wonderfully caring and understanding when she discovers that a boy who works for her father has a serious and difficult to live with secret. This film, which employed a largely non professional cast, with a tiny crew, on an even smaller budget, manages to pull off what many big budget Hollywood productions have tried and failed. It has taken a painful and socially difficult issue and presented it in a believable and non judgemental way, and without histrionics or excess of drum-banging. Naturally and appropriately acted by all. I would though, have been interested to see more made of the Jewish element; Jorgelina's Judaism is only mentioned once."
