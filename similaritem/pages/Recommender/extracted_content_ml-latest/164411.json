         "content": "**Seeking a second chance for the normal life.**\r\n\r\nWhenever I review a Stop-motion animated film, I always start with by saying it is a dying art form that needs a bigger lift from us. It gave a new life for filmmaking when there were no technology like computers hundred years ago for the creation of giant creatures to all the fantasy and magical world. I am glad that every year someone coming forward to show the world how beautiful these are.\r\n\r\nI think there's a quota for it and 2D animation for the Oscars. Otherwise, these formats would die sooner than we expected, so that recognition in the big stage. Every year at least one film from these two categories makes out. This year it was a double jackpot for Stop-motion animation. Including this, 'Kubo and the Two Strings' was the other one to shine in the world's biggest film awards ceremony. But winning the trophy is almost impossible in this 3D animated film world. Anyway, I'm happy for this, that I enjoyed watching it.\r\n\r\nIt was a short film, that ran for just one hour. First, we have to understand filmmaking in this form is a most challenging one than any other. It is a manual work. I mean people get in there and frame by frame do all the work. So for this one hour film, they had done the great hard work and it paid off well by got nominated for the Oscars. It was also Switzerland's official submission for the Best Foreign Language Film, but failed to make progress in that race.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay was based on the book. A simple story with a strong message. This is the tale of a boy with full of dreams and after his alcoholic mother died, he is taken to the orphanage. That is the last place he wanted to be where he meets a mean boy and soon becomes his close friend. Being young kids, they tend to play some pranks with officials, visitors and themselves. That's one of the ways to cope with for where they have ended. So the remaining is to tell us would they get a second chance in their lives.\r\n\r\n> ❝I don't know why I'm crying. Sometimes people cry because they're happy.❞\r\n\r\nWhen some take up a project like this, they are not offered to make mistakes in choosing a weak screenplay. Because there are thousands of films in production around the world and in those, a handful of animated films, but probably he's only one up for a Stop-motion animated feature. Which means everyone with the knowledge of his commitment will be looking forward to it. So the filmmakers have opted to adapt a novel, which is always a best option in filmmaking.\r\n\r\nThe next is the characters. Making them come alive, particularly initial stage, the creation of models. Yep, they have done that job as well so well. Gooding looking ones, especially among the kids for having similarity with their vision. The frame rate was good. Very smoother for viewing. So technically it was a flawless for the normal watch. An impressive storyline, which might serve as a tearjerker for a few.\r\n\r\nThere's a little romance, but from the children's perspective of having a crush. Since the girl character was introduced, the narration takes a fresh look. The following event becomes even more adventurous and fun filled till the end. The voice-over was excellent. From the dialogues to the film scenes very impressive. It marks the directional debut for a short filmmaker. An appreciable work and I hope he makes more like them with new technics than migrating to computer animations.\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages is it is a short and sweet film, but those who love such films might feel it is too short. Most importantly, there're not clichés like what we've seen films that takes place in the orphanages. The opening was shocking. If it was a real life, the boy would have ended in a different place. Still the emotional parts were less explored, yet very convincing for not leaning too much on that facet.\r\n\r\nThe film is one of the best in its kind, but I agree it's not a masterpiece. Not if you have seen plenty of Stop-motion animations in your life. Yet it can't be neglected that easily and surely it is for everyone. I know there are folks who thinks this format of films are for little ones, but the truth is they are still in the pre 90s mindset. This is good, give it a try and you might love it. Anyway, for its rareness itself highly recommended, then you decided how do you liked it or not.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",

         "It's easy to dismiss an animated film like this that deals with the themes that this does. The film's quality, however, goes a long way towards making us realize that running time doesn't dictate how good something is. This film is short, but it packs a punch. One of its biggest strengths is that it doesn't try to fill up the running time or try to do many other turns in the storyline. It's very, very simply but as a result its themes are clearer than many other animated films' themes. It's handled with delicacy and subtlety. It's an incredibly strong film that I recommend.",
         "Deeply touching, funny, human and quirky stop motion animated film from France. While theoretically for kids, any film that opens with a depressed 9 year old accidentally killing his verbally abusive alcoholic mother (and treating it as sad black comedy) is not exactly aimed at 7 year olds. There's a lovely emotional complexity to this brief feature (66 minutes), where life at an orphanage full of kids from circumstances as damaging and horrible as 'Zucchini's actually has a kind of odd sweetness. Characters evolve and show new sides, and are wonderfully voiced very naturally in part by real kids. Plus the adults at the orphanage, as well as the policeman who bring's Zucchini there really try to provide love, support and fun for their charges as best they can (and when have we ever seen THAT in a film or even book? 'Orphanage' and 'cop' are usually other words for 'evil'). That humanity makes the limbo where these deeply wounded but wonderfully resilient kids live rich and real \u2013 and often very funny. I really appreciated how often I had no idea how things ( a plot twist or a relationship) would turn out. I liked the film from the start, but it just grew and grew on me as I watched it, topped off by a wonderfully odd 'outtake' after the film ends. Creative, alive and terrific. NB: I had just finished writing this review when I learned that the film is being re-voiced by some (admittedly excellent) US actors for release here. That may work out great, but all the performances in the original are so lovely and perfect, that I would suggest seeing the subtitled version if at all possible.",
         "\"My Life As a Zucchini\" (2016 release from Switzerland; 70 min.; original title \"Ma vie de Courgette\") brings the story of a 9 yr. old boy nicknamed Zucchini by his mom. As the movie opens, we see the boy playing in his attic room, as his mom drinks beer after beer while watching TV. After an unfortunate incident during which the boy accidentally causes his mom to fall off of the attic stairs, the boy is taken away to a country-side orphanage, where he has trouble fitting in with the other 5 kids. Then some time later, a new kid enters the orphanage, a girl named Camille. At this point we are maybe 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out. Couple of comments: this is a stop-motion animated film. I admit not being familiar with Swiss director Claude Barras, but regardless, Barras here brings a tale (based on the book \"Autobiographie d'une Courgette\") that cuts close to the heart about the need for love and understanding. The boy, missing his father (whom he has painted on his kite) AND his alcoholic mother (it's not clear what became of her, other that \"she went away), is desperate for love and companionship as he makes his new life at the orphanage. The main characters are fully developed, with lost of nuance, and while there is quite a bit of humor in the film, the overall feeling is more bittersweet than anything. This movie is rated PG-13 for a reason and I would not recommend this for any kids younger than 9 or 10. BEWARE: the US theater release which I saw brings the movie in a dubbed version, sadly. It takes away from the charm of the movie, not to mention the originality (it's like watching the Simpsons dubbed in French if you get my drift). That point is only driven home even more so since we get , after the movie's end credits, a fake take-out of the boy being auditioned for the role, which is shown in French with subtitles, and you can immediately feel the difference in the voice characters. Shame on the US distributor for \"dumbing down\" the US release. Last but certainly not least, there is a delight soundtrack to this movie, courtesy of Swiss singer-songwriter Sophie Hunger (check out the heartbreaking tune that plays over the end credits). \"My Life As a Zucchini\" got an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature at the recent Oscars. The fact that it didn't win is besides the point, this is a top-notch quality movie, period. My only other complaint, other than the US theater release being dubbed, is that I wasn't ready to bid farewell to this film after just over an hour... (The screening was rounded out by another Swiss stop-motion animated shortie, the 8 min. delightful \"The Genie In the Box of Raviolis\".) \"My Life As a Zucchini\" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly (only 6 people, including myself), so I imagine this will not play more than a week in the theater. If you have a chance to catch this later on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, I strongly recommend you do so, you won't regret it. \"My Life As a Zucchini\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",
         "My Life as a Zucchini was nominated for Best Feature Film at the 89th Academy Awards. And for a 70 minute feature, that says a lot. This French-Swiss stop-motion animation film takes on a mature content but never fails to keep its child-like tone and to an extent, its innocence. It follows the story of Icare (but prefers to be called Zucchini), who lives with his alcoholic mother. After an accident, Zucchini has been sent to an orphanage by a policeman named Raymond. Zucchini's start at the orphanage is rough\u2014thanks to the Simon, the bully. From there on, we are immersed into Zucchini's adventures as he learns of friendship, of family and of love. This animated film ravel with its wonderful visuals that reminds us of the days when its was toys over tablets. In a way, this serves as a nostalgic treat for teenagers. Almost every scene carries a powerful meaning. But its greatest feat is looking at the lives of these children through a different lens\u2014they are all abandoned, damaged or broken. One has her mom deported, the other has his father jailed\u2014 these are all mature themes but nevertheless, real. But despite all that, Zucchini and his crew are all still children. They play, they dance, they sing. The film never stops to carry this child-like tone. The colorful aesthetics are impactful and an array of vibrancy spreads across the screen. It is a brave film that looks at life at an emotional depth. It's an eye-opening experience.",
         "\"My Life as a Courgette\" is such a simple story and simplicity really is the film's greatest strength. There is no flamboyant animation, no huge narrative arc, no gargantuan obstacles to somersault over, no chaotic chase sequences, no loud, yappy dialogue...basically nothing like what you might expect if this same story was told by an American studio. At 66 mins, it's short and to the point, quiet, contemplative and starkly sad, yet filled with uplifting moments of hope and tenderness, which it conveys without ever feeling contrived or overly- sentimental. The young French voice cast are terrific (I do hope anyone reading this review watches the French version and not the American dub). They do well to convey the vulnerability behind the broken characters. That, and I think some of the lines just sound so much better in French - the way the brattish Simon spits out the word \"potet\" was particularly amusing to me. The animation is rather basic and the character's faces are not hugely expressive, but enough emotion is conveyed through body posing, vocal performance and composition that you would need a heart of stone not to feel for the young gang of misfits. By the time the bitter-sweet end credits song kicked in, I was noticing a little moisture in the corner of my eye. Not sure the kids in the audience enjoyed it as much as I did though....which is an important point really. This film is NOT intended for young children. It deals with adult themes like death, neglect and abuse, in a very delicate way mind, but still, it's not something that's going to entertain the 'fidget spinner' generation.",
         "\"Many people, for many reasons, feel rootless - but orphans and abandoned or abused children have particular cause.\" Christina Baker Kline Stories about orphans such as Dickens' Oliver Twist have a special place--they remind us of what a gift family is. Having loving parents and siblings provides safe haven from hunger of the stomach and the heart. Claude Barras' moving stop- motion animation, My Life as a Zucchini, explores the plight of seven young orphans with emphasis on Zucchini, a name given to him by his drunken mother. As he goes off to an orphanage, he discovers more challenges than being with his mom, whose memory he keeps by carrying around one of her discarded beer cans. The usual bully (Simon) is in residence along with some meek kids and with Camille, a saucy ten year old ready to take on Simon's cynicism and Zucchini's love. As you can tell by the entrance of Camille, all is not lost at this homeless haven, much less the emerging sense of cooperation and compassion. The film gently approaches each major crisis with equanimity, relying not on easy solutions or catastrophes but on the emerging sense of cooperation and sincere love. It's difficult to determine what makes this animation so human with its characters and their eccentricities; all I know is that I felt deeply about each orphan right down to the wicked aunt. It's not sentimental, mind you, just powerfully humane and deserving its Oscar nomination for best animation. Could it be the Keane-like big eyes, so expressively alive with emotion? Possibly so. At any rate, this animation will appeal to all ages and answer some age-old questions about the depth of loneliness and the salvation adoption can bring. \"Orphanages are the only places that ever left me feeling empty and full at the same time.\" John M. Simmons",
         "The way they made this film was very original, and good originality is very valuable and worth watching. I love stop-motion, in this is an excellent stop-motion, because of everything in the film impressed me. The characters are very original, even the name that the main character has is amazing. The screenplay embraces so many genuine topics, as love and the different ways it can be shown; it has humor but it also wants to make you cry and fall in love with each character. The production is incredible, amazing, out of this world; and I couldn't ask for more, it made me want to cry because of this simple but outstanding production! This motion picture is really worth watching, is very touching; and if I could only watch one movie for the rest of my life it will be this one.",
         "Great movie. Awesome. I thought this movie would be sad, but it's not sad. The only sad part is the beginning. The movie has a lot of heart without being tragic or sad. You just get to see the main character interact with the other characters and grow into a better life. The only flaw is the film has a rosy depiction of orphanages, when orphanages are not nice places in any way.",
         "What a felicitous oeuvre! Not the shiny kind of beauty, the other kind, the one that transcends. The story telling, the animation, the backgrounds, everything seems a bit minimalist but the intensity of this 60 minute movie I found was overwhelming. The central theme of the movie: unconditional love. In some scenes it becomes more explicit, in other less. But I discovered several expressions of it, all cunningly portrayed. Some gorgeous, some hide in the shadows before revealing themselves and others seem even darkly romantic. The most touching, that I will remember for some time to come; When Simon tells Courgette to take his chance - after all Simon just did to reunite the gang, wanting to have all is friends back together and as happy as possible. Sting sang; \"if you love somebody, set them free\" - here is what that might look like. Funny that this topic turns out so well, when the story revolves around kids. Food for though; about where pure love might come from and how adults need to cultivate it. This is a nice change among all the tit for tat stories and the Hollywood saga of the outsider rising to a hero that get rehashed time and time again. The voice acting by Nick Offerman was also deserves a special mention here.",
         "Whenever I review a Stop-motion animated film, I always start with by saying it is a dying art form that needs a bigger lift from us. It gave a new life for filmmaking when there were no technology like computers hundred years ago for the creation of giant creatures to all the fantasy and magical world. I am glad that every year someone coming forward to show the world how beautiful these are. I think there's a quota for it and 2D animation for the Oscars. Otherwise, these formats would die sooner than we expected, so that recognition in the big stage. Every year at least one film from these two categories makes out. This year it was a double jackpot for Stop-motion animation. Including this, 'Kubo and the Two Strings' was the other one to shine in the world's biggest film awards ceremony. But winning the trophy is almost impossible in this 3D animated film world. Anyway, I'm happy for this, that I enjoyed watching it. It was a short film, that ran for just one hour. First, we have to understand filmmaking in this form is a most challenging one than any other. It is a manual work. I mean people get in there and frame by frame do all the work. So for this one hour film, they had done the great hard work and it paid off well by got nominated for the Oscars. It was also Switzerland's official submission for the Best Foreign Language Film, but failed to make progress in that race. The screenplay was based on the book. A simple story with a strong message. This is the tale of a boy with full of dreams and after his alcoholic mother died, he is taken to the orphanage. That is the last place he wanted to be where he meets a mean boy and soon becomes his close friend. Being young kids, they tend to play some pranks with officials, visitors and themselves. That's one of the ways to cope with for where they have ended. So the remaining is to tell us would they get a second chance in their lives. ❝I don't know why I'm crying. Sometimes people cry because they're happy.❞ When some take up a project like this, they are not offered to make mistakes in choosing a weak screenplay. Because there are thousands of films in production around the world and in those, a handful of animated films, but probably he's only one up for a Stop-motion animated feature. Which means everyone with the knowledge of his commitment will be looking forward to it. So the filmmakers have opted to adapt a novel, which is always a best option in filmmaking. The next is the characters. Making them come alive, particularly initial stage, the creation of models. Yep, they have done that job as well so well. Gooding looking ones, especially among the kids for having similarity with their vision. The frame rate was good. Very smoother for viewing. So technically it was a flawless for the normal watch. An impressive storyline, which might serve as a tearjerker for a few. There's a little romance, but from the children's perspective of having a crush. Since the girl character was introduced, the narration takes a fresh look. The following event becomes even more adventurous and fun filled till the end. The voice-over was excellent. From the dialogues to the film scenes very impressive. It marks the directional debut for a short filmmaker. An appreciable work and I hope he makes more like them with new technics than migrating to computer animations. One of the advantages is it is a short and sweet film, but those who love such films might feel it is too short. Most importantly, there're not clichés like what we've seen films that takes place in the orphanages. The opening was shocking. If it was a real life, the boy would have ended in a different place. Still the emotional parts were less explored, yet very convincing for not leaning too much on that facet. The film is one of the best in its kind, but I agree it's not a masterpiece. Not if you have seen plenty of Stop-motion animations in your life. Yet it can't be neglected that easily and surely it is for everyone. I know there are folks who thinks this format of films are for little ones, but the truth is they are still in the pre 90s mindset. This is good, give it a try and you might love it. Anyway, for its rareness itself highly recommended, then you decided how do you liked it or not. 7/10",
         "Icare or as he prefers, Zucchini, lives with his drunken single mother. He accidentally kills his mom and is sent to a children's home. Police officer Raymond befriends him. Simon bullies him but becomes a good friend. New girl Camille arrives and he falls for her. This is an European stop-motion animated film. It has an unusual intriguing look. The character designs have a beautiful ugliness. My only drawback is its shorter running time. There is something odd about this inbetween length and leaves me missing something. I do like Simon's turn especially. Initially, he is a full-on bully but he turns into one of the most compelling character in the movie. The story has some real heart. This is an Oscar nominated animation.",
         "An animated French film about a young boy nicknamed Courgette (French for Zucchini) who moves to an orphanage after his mother dies in an accident. From the poster you can see that the film is in claymation; at first, creepy, but becomes rather cute and beautiful when in motion. For a kid's film, it has quite a dark opening that would freak kids out even if they don't understand what's going on. I wasn't sure where it would go from there. The film turned out to be quite heartwarming and funny, cute and rather gentle. A great message on the relationship between parents and children and it's importance, that kids and adults can both get something out of. Sitting among kids and adults in the cinema, I had a great time.",
         "If there was ever a way to tell a story of a 9 year old boy who mistakenly killed his mother and had to stay at a foster home with other children, who were either depressed or had autism/behavior problems, it is told in My life as a Zucchini. Now don't run away yet thinking it's a sad movie. That's not it at all. This is a movie that takes a very heavy hearted story and turns it into a light hearted tale through humor and joys of the youth. But nonetheless, I wouldn't recommend seeing this with the kids. There is a certain feeling that us as people sometimes get when a story sheds some light on the darkest parts of the universe and you can definitely expect that from this film. Love is it's own language and we first learn it, just like with most things, from our parents. This movie shows how love could be understood on its own if we are lucky, but it takes a lot more strength. If you think you've seen it all, you'll be surprised by this very short 66 minute film and I would recommend this to anyone who is wants to see a movie that challenges their hearts.",
         "\"Ma vie de Courgette\" or \"My Life as a Zucchini\" is a Swiss-French co-production from 2016 that resulted in a French-language movie. This is one of the most successful animated films of the years for sure and the recent Oscar nomination (even if it has no shot at winning probably) proves how much everybody ended up liking it. It is a relatively short full feature film, runs for roughly an hour only, not including credits and thus is not too far away from the short film category. The title (Veggie Tales anyone?) and the animation and the main character may have some people think that this is really only a film directed at very young audiences, but this is definitely a wrong statement. The film offers great characters and a truly interesting story. I personally think that the main reason why so many people like this one is the mix of emotion and realism. In the viewing I was in, there was not a single child seeing it, but several grown-ups. I am not saying at all that it is not suitable for teenagers, but that it is suitable for every age. Speaking about emotion, this is a factor that is there from start to finish as the film takes place at an orphanage for the entire time basically. We follow the lives of the characters, especially the one of Zucchini, and how they interact with each other. The kids are all somewhat tortured souls because of how they lost their parents and it's visible all the times through their actions and interactions. As we find out very early, there is another kid that seems like a bit of an antagonist, but the longer the film goes, the more we realize he is another friendly character that maybe just hides his vulnerability behind mannerisms that were supposed to be cool. It's interesting how he starts opening up and respecting Zucchini after he beats him in a fight. It's also interesting how the girl beats him with words on her very first day. This also shows that this cool kid is no antagonist as he still helps the girl in a crucial situation eventually. I quite liked her (Zucchini's love interest) and the scene with the other girl and the hair was as witty and touching as was the comparison between weather and emotional states of the kids. Of course there are grown-up characters too, some good one, some bad ones, but all credible and realistic. This animated film is a prime example of a movie that would also have worked with actors and live action. There are no fantasy elements in here, no talking animals or so, but it is a depiction of real life. The film was really written very well and it is without a doubt one of the most authentic films of 2016. I am definitely closer in giving it a ****/***** than a **/*****. Maybe I will if I re-watch it at some point, which is not unlikely. Until then, I am really glad it has received this much attention. Actually I think the ending is also pretty nice for a possible sequel and who knows with all the success here, it is certainly a possibility. I'd definitely watch it if it ever happens. Please do yourself a favor and check this one out if you have a chance.",
         "(Flash Review) For being stop-action, clay animation, it was a very realistic-focused film. Nothing wildly creative or imaginative. The film starts off with a boy nicknamed Zucchini, whose mother is an abusive drunk. An incident occurs and he is sent to live in an orphanage. Much of the film consists of him finding his place with the other kids and his interactions with the house's bully and a new arrival kid. I think the director felt that with how real the characters and their situations are that it would be very relatable to many and an interesting perspective to relate to clay characters. It was a fun, colorful and honest look at life through clay.",
         "'My Life As A Courgette' is an emotionally mature and charming little stop-motion picture that tells its positive and uplifting small-scale story in a breezy 67- minutes without wasting a single beautiful frame; it's refreshing to see a piece of family entertainment that deals with some pretty heavy themes and tackles them fairly head on without ever letting them weigh it down, and it's this that sets it apart from the others in the genre as it allows the picture to feel truly genuine and for it be truly touching too, providing a proper connection to the central children with whom we both laugh and cry. 7/10",
         "'My Life as a Courgette' was the last of the five 2016/7 Best Animated Feature Oscar nominees viewed by me, and that it is (to me) the weakest of the nominees and still manages to be a very good film is testament to how great the other four films ('The Red Turtle', 'Kubo', 'Moana' and the winner 'Zootropolis', so very stiff competition) were. There is not a whole lot wrong with 'My Life as a Courgette'. At just over an hour it is a little too short and it did have a story that was deserving of a longer length, and the depiction of orphanages (usually a dark and unhappy environment that people can't wait to leave) is rather rose-tinted. Otherwise, it is a beautifully done film that has much more to it than the quirky if silly title, the cute-looking characters and bright colourful visuals make out. Not classing these attributes as bad things in any way, but it is so easy hearing and seeing it advertised to get the wrong idea about 'My Life as a Courgette', thinking it will be a quirky film with children as its primary target audience, bright colours and witty humour when actually there is much to the film than that. It is a beautifully animated film certainly. It is very vibrantly bright and colourful, with parts of truly haunting atmosphere, a vividly immersive world and meticulously detailed backgrounds and overall visuals from the little things to the bigger effects. Just as good are the eye-catching character designs that are modelled smoothly and even with the oddball looks look and behave very authentically, for characters they are very unique and charmingly unusual (what other title character has blue hair and a red nose?). Furthermore, the music score is appropriately atmospheric and whimsical, while the writing has quirks and poignancy. The story could have benefited from a longer length but still charms, amuses and moves, with a surprisingly sober tone, while not being afraid to take risks and brave more difficult subjects with sensitivity and never heavy-handedness. This is including one of the boldest opening sequences in any animated film (perhaps the boldest since that for Disney's 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'). Everything is paced beautifully too. Characters are very easy to warm to and have engaging, distinct personalities. Voice acting in both the American and particularly French versions is very emotive. On the whole, beautiful film and has much more to it than one would think. 8/10 Bethany Cox",
         "Ernest & Celestine, A Town Called Panic, The Little Prince, April and the Extraordinary World, Long Way North, Mune: Guardian of the Moon, The Day of the Crows, Song of the Sea, The Secret of Kells, and now My Life as a Courgette. I have been following animated titles closely for the past years. Japan repeats its own tropes. Other Asian countries try new things such as live action puppets / cgi hybrids which have good comedic value, but tends to get old soon. American studio's often have their main focus on agenda rather than content. Russian seems to be so unknown that no one knows about Snow Queen and how Frozen (despite me loving that film) is basically a rip off of it. Other countries have mainly been dropping single titles which end up being disappointing. France is by no means ahead of USA and Japan, but they have confirmed their place as good 3rd. Their main problem being how little animation films they make, despite them having the biggest rate on creating good movies. My Life as a Courgette is once again a worthy title. The movie does an impressive job by being a serious work about life and its problems. While the movie follows young people and their daily life, it is not aimed for young audience - yet is completely suitable for children as well. The movie is rather substance heavy with dramatic concepts which not just any youngster nor even viewer could understand. The impressive part being how much depth the characters have on their personas -despite their young age- and how much realism they deliver. The style is original in the French style. Subdued and minimalist, yet every part is clearly put together with care and lot of planning. I will use the word \"fitting\" to describe the character design, just because I couldn't imagine them looking any other way. Each character is also made with a lot of care and planning. The opposite from Japanese movies where you can tell the main character from rest of the folks by just looking the hair color. In this movie, none of the characters are a filler. \"The night out shot in snowy forest\" scene gave me chills. The OST and bgm managed to surprise me as well. I would go as far and say that French animation movies have made me appreciate the French language which I have always found ugly sounding. It wouldn't be the same movie without the French voice actors. This is really a quality animation film from every aspect. It isn't the best thing ever, but surely an amazing animation title when comparing to general standard. I can not but recommend this to every who enjoys mature content and animation movies. I hope a lot of parents show this movie to their children as well because it has so much to offer.",
         "\"My Life as a Zucchini\" was nominated for Best Animated Feature for the 2017 Academy Awards but lost to \"Zootopia\". It's a shame, as 2017 offered three very deserving films (I would also include \"Kubo\") and only one could take home the award. Perhaps my love for \"My Life as a Zucchini\" is influenced by my work as a social worker and therapist, as the story is a hopeful tale about children who have been shamefully abused by their parents...a common problem I had to deal with on the job. The story begins with a child stuck in the attic of a horrible home while his mother is downstairs getting drunk and violent. When she tries to enter the attic to beat the boy, he panics and slams down the trap door...and the mother falls to her death. Soon the child is being talked to be a very kind police officer, Raymond, and he's surprised to hear that the boy's mother just called him 'Zucchini' and that's the only name he knows. Fortunately for poor little Zucchini, the man is touched by this case and regularly visits him in the children's home where he is sent to live. As for the children's home, seven children reside in the place and they are given kindness and love. It's actually a pretty nice place, but your heart goes out to the children and the hell they've had to go through during their short lives. Most of the story is about Zucchini and how he adjusts to the place as well as his falling for a girl who arrives soon after him, Camille. And, fortunately, the picture, while VERY moving and sad, has a nice happy ending. This is a very, very special stop-motion film. While it's very artistic and well done it is something more...it's very sweet and has a depth to it you really don't expect in animation. The Swiss film is available in both the original French language version and an English dub (which is very good) on the same DVD. Perhaps other versions are also available, but on the DVD I saw these were the two language choices. Well worth seeing...but have a Kleenex or two handy just in case.",
         "Movie night with Gertie. Oscar-nominated stop-motion animation, as poignant and well observed a film about the darker side of childhood as you could ever hope to see. Touching on bereavement and bullying, but does so in a way that is humorous and ultimately life-affirming. Courgette has big, marvellously expressive eyes. You quickly forget that you're watching puppets. There are plenty of laughs, especially the ill-informed sex education. And it has Ron Swanson for god' sake. This is a film that should appeal both to adults and to older children. This is a sensitive and very nuanced account of orphan children. One word lovely.",
         "Cried all the way through, it's a really beautiful and understated movie that's so lovable.",
         "The movie im reccomending is called My Life as a Zucchini or Ma vie de Courgette thgat was a 2016 Swiss-French production directed by Claude Barras. It was an adult stop motion animation that was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the 89th academy awards, but lost to Zootopia. It was an adaptation of Gilles Paris' 2002 novel Autobiographie d'une Courgette. On rotten tomatoes my life as a zucchini has a rating of 98%. The site's critical consensus reads, \"My Life as a Zucchini's silly title and adorable characters belie a sober story whose colorful visuals delight the senses even as it braves dark emotional depths.\" plot SPOILERS : Icare, the main character, lives with his mother who has become a irritable and sometimes violent alcoholic since her husband (Icare's father) left / dissapeared. Icare is seen flying a kite decorated with a crayon drawing of his father in a stormy sky- making believe that his absent father is a super hero. Later his mother apporaches him in a druken rage when he accidentally knocks some emty beer can down the stairs. Icare accidentally closes the stair hatch in fear on his mother and loud crash, implying his mother's death is heard. Icare is then pictured in a police station ansering the gentle questions of a police officer named Raymond. He tells officer Raymond he wants to go by his mother's nickname for him: Courgette (translates to zucchini). Raymond takes courgette to a orphanage that is neither miserable nor joyous. One of orphans, a ginger named Simon bullies Courgette. Courgette comes to learn the various situations of each of his fellow orphans and eventually reveals his own situation. A new girl named Camille arrives at the orpahnage shortly there after and Courgette is immediately infatuated with her and they grow to become close friends quickly. However Camille's spitful aunt repeated tries to for Camille to come live with her so she can collect government benifits. However, when court day to review the custody case arrives, Simon redeems himself by playing a recording of how Camille's aunt talks to her, causing her aunt to have an outburst in court and lose the case. ect. ect. You should watch My life as a zucchini not only because it one of the few highquality stop motion animations made every year and its careful visual design, but for its simple and quiet, yet well developed and excellently excuted story. It's a welcome change in pace from the flambouyant action, flat charcter trophes, meaningless slap-stick dialogue, and massive, world-changing narrative archs that make up the majority of animated films. There is plenty of comedy, but it never detracts from/contradicts the scenes mood or distracts from the ongoing story. The focused and contemplative quietness of this film and the intense attention to the nuanced emotions its characters experience build both starkly sad and tenderly uplifiting moments with out betraying reality. It is only 66 minutes long and makes full use of every second. Also the ending credits song is fire - Le Vent nous portera, covery by Sophie Hunger. The (French) voice actors, particularly Gaspard Schlatter and Sixtine Murat who play the two main leads Courgette and Camille did an excellent job of bring to life a child's perspective. I haven't watched the English dubbed version, but I've heard it doesn't measure up to the orginal voice acting in French, so I'd reccomend watching the French version if you can. One review called \"My Life as a Zucchini\" undercooked? Its main complaint was that the \"emotional heft of the film is unexpected and the problems some of characters face are nothing that a child should have to deal with\" and they \"don't know who'd I recommend this film to\". While their observation that the cast of characters face disproportionately heavy problems despite their young age is true, it doesn't detract from the overall movie because the film's target audience was not necissarily elementary age children even though its main characters are. In fact, I don't think this movie is well suited to a very young audience (I think some parts are proabably too mature for kids under 12/13-ish). I think the main aim of the movie was not to provide high-energy entertainment aimed at children, but to explore the emotional complexities the characters face as result of their situation. These themes are presented in layered and often nuanced ways that only an adult/adolescent would be likely to pick up on or find interesting. Another criticism of My Life as a Zucchini is that its story, which starts as a tragic orphanage situation is too cliche. While this criticism is fair in that the story does have a cliche set up, the way in which the characters navigate and cope with their situation and their emotional complexities is thoroughly explored, well executed, and ultimately very heartfelt.",

         "Sure, children can watch this and be entertained by the cutesy animation. Just do not, I repeat, do not go into this thinking it has no substance. The first five minutes happen and I immediately said \"well...we're going there are we?\". Hit me like a tonne of bricks falling on my face. Essentially we follow a group of young children in a foster home as they create close bonds between them and learn to mature into adulthood. A coming-of-age drama at its most subtle, and it is with this subtlety that elevates this into a melancholic intimate experience. Child abuse, neglect, loneliness, sorrow and love. All these themes are explored through the perspective of children, and it is rather sad to watch. Witnessing these characters come to terms with their past was inspiring. No matter what obstacles life throws in your way, you can always move onwards and upwards. An outstandingly meaty narrative despite the tiny runtime of just 67 minutes. However it's not all doom and gloom. This feature will evoke happiness and bring a loving smile to your face by the end. Like I said, the subtle manner in which it addresses important issues like child abuse is what gives this film life. The colourful stop-motion animation (which I absolutely adored) and bountiful subplots are just ripples in what is a sensitive puddle. The balance between melodrama, family friendliness and humour was perfect, couldn't fault it. The small idiosyncrasies to each character gave them more personality, which I admired. I personally would've liked a longer runtime so we could see these characters interact more. Some more internal conflicts and backstory would've definitely enhanced the emotional investment. Though these are slight criticisms to what is a beautifully crafted animated story that more people definitely need to watch. Support these small films! Cinema needs them. It's just another reason why French cinema keeps on improving...",
         "I randomly stumbled across this movie while surfing Netflix, and I'm so glad I watched it! First off, the plot is quite simple. It's essentially about a young orphaned boy, Courgette (Zucchini), who finds love and friendship during his time at an orphanage. Having watched many films with complex plots, I found the simplicity of \"My Life as a Courgette\" to be very refreshing. In terms of the characters, I found all of them to be very believable/realistic. Additionally, I was able to empathize with every character (except for the evil ones, haha). In this regard, I must give a lot of credit to the voice actors as they brought so much life and emotion to these characters! I also want to add that the animation is relatively low-key, which I believe actually enhances the simplistic nature of this film. I must, however, warn you that the animation is a bit choppy. I personally didn't mind this, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea. Overall, this movie is short and sweet. With a runtime of only 66 minutes, it's great to watch if you're not in the mood for a long movie. Many important themes - such as child abuse and love - are explored, and the movie does a beautiful job following a young boy's journey. I highly recommend you give this movie a try!"
