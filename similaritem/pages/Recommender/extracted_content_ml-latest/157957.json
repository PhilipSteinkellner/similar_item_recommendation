Sometimes so much that the dialog sounded like it was original scripted in English and then translated (if you speak Greek you will sound funny dialog not used in Greece but if you are watching this with subs I guess it will be OK). Despite that, the scenario was interesting enough, there was action and fun and I think the creators accomplished their mission and made a fine movie (for a non Hollywood one) The characters was also very inserting except from the main one. The main actor was short of talent and ruined the most of the scenes with unrealistic speech (like radio commercial actor) and movement. Good movie. Liked it better than a lot Hollywood high budget bad movies!"],
