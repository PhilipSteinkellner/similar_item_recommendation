         "I really enjoyed The Ultimate Gift (original film) and saw it at a time in my life where it really hit home and really registered with me. I was greatly looking forward to this sequel. Having said that, something seemed missing this time around. To be honest, this entire movie feels like DVD bonus material for that original film. That's not a bad thing but despite a great message, this effort feels lacking. I enjoyed the Red Stevens back story but the writing and story feels somewhat shallow and incomplete. Since I enjoyed and was moved by the first film, this extended look appealed to me. Truthfully, as a stand alone film it really doesn't hold up well at all even delivering a wonderful message and few points to live by and dwell upon. More than worth watching if you enjoyed the first film.",
         "When The Ultimate Life was released, I decided to go to the theater to watch it, thinking that it would be as good as The Ultimate Gift (I've watched that movie a few times, including shortly before going to see The Ultimate Life) - The Ultimate Life ended up being an unnecessary addition to the original, unless you're interested in the family's background and don't like the ending of the original movie. If you haven't seen The Ultimate Gift, be sure to watch that movie before viewing The Ultimate Life. Once again Jason is learning how to be a model citizen, but this time through reading his grandfather's journal. The prequel (most of the movie) shows Red at a young age, how the family became rich, and how his mistakes led to some of the family's problems (more money was never enough to him, he neglected his family). Red's change in character is shown, but unfortunately it came too late for his own children (most followed the bad example he set for them when they were younger). The sequel is predictable to anyone who's watched The Ultimate Gift. Some people think that this movie is Christian - The truth is that there is very little mention of God or anything else associated with Christianity (most people would agree with the movie's message, regardless of religion).",
         "This is a sequel to the 2006s 'The Ultimate Gift'. The story commences from where It ended in the first, but after opening few minutes it takes us to the flashback story in the earlier decades. It was not a bad story at all, but it did not have any valuable film stars in it to lighten up. Especially failing to bring back Drew Fuller was the biggest drawback for this sequel. Other than that it was well filmed in beautiful places in the United States. This movie was not bad as you heard about it. If you try it once, you will realise what I was saying. It is a fine B movie. ✰✰✰✰✰✰½/10",
         "I usually do not find a lot to be critical of in a movie. I like cheesy action films, bad comedies, and overdone dramas. But this movie was just awful. The acting looked like it was from a whose line is it anyway skit. It was like the skit where one actor is given a character to play and they overact it so ridiculously that the other improvist can easily guess who they are. And this acting was pervasive throughout the film. The interactions between the characters were unbelievable. The main guy, proposing to his girlfriend with the ring in hand, is served a subpoena and promptly puts the ring away and leaves the girlfriend there alone. I get it. The guy has his priorities mixed up. But, that's ridiculous. Additionally, the whole movie is a flashback that the main guy is reading about in his grandpa's journal. After a night's reading, he is a changed man, and is now worthy of his girlfriend. Come on. But the frustration continues. The flashback portion of the movie takes us back to late depression era USA. Following the grandpa now (who is 15 at the time) we get to see comical attempts in recreating the time periods. Sitting around the table in an obviously poor apartment, is the grandpa's family. His younger brother has on a t shirt that was clearly bought at old navy. Later, the grandpa is getting paid for a day's work. The dollars he is paid in look suspicious from a distant camera shot, but whatever. But then, the camera zooms in nice and close to show 20s that are clearly a modern design. These are small things that honestly made the whole movie look silly. I suppose those involved with making this movie are of the mindset that the wonderful message behind it absolves them of any professional film making responsibility. In reality, they do that wonderful message injustice by expressing it through unbelievable dialog, poor acting, comical laziness in recreating time eras, and logic defying character development.",
         "The Ultimate Life has been attacked by critics as a sop to \"family values\" types and prudes, who complain about \"too much sex and violence\" in movies. I'm not a prude or an ultra religious person, and I loved this film. I knew nothing about it when I agreed to go with two friends, who had seen trailers for it. I nearly passed after reading critics' reviews, and boy, am I glad I didn't. This is a \"feel good\" movie which I highly recommend, particularly to anyone who likes a good romance. The main characters are shown falling in love as teens and still in love as adults. It presents its characters honestly and shows how someone can change from ruthlessly pursuing riches to wanting to do good for mankind. You'll also see beautiful cinematography of the Texas prairies. There are battle scenes of WW II and it also portrays the beginning of the oil industry in Texas. The key word for me is romance. Ignore the critics this time. This is a story well told. Please check this review for spoilers.",
         "The Ultimate Life was a fantastic movie, and I was greatly surprised when I went to the theater a mere 4 days after its release and there were only 3 other people there. The movie itself was a well done sequel/prequel to The Ultimate Gift. In my opinion, this movie has a lot more of an impact if you have see the other before this one, I would highly recommend watching The Ultimate Gift prior to The Ultimate Life. The main takeaway from this movie should be that we have too much selfishness inside of us, and if everyone keeps living at the rate we are living now, we are going to grow up breeding selfish generation after generation. Of course this is an extreme over generalization for our world, since there are obviously still good people in the world, like the ones who inspired this movie I would imagine. And one of the more important lessons we learn from this film is that the greatest fortune in life is love and family, without those, not even a billion dollars could ever truly satisfy our desires. Riches, possessions, trophies, and anything else we accumulate on this world will fade, and it will fail us. Ultimately, we are remembered by our legacy, which is not only what we have done in life, but also by our family and future generations, who will be our legacy. The film itself was done very well in terms of recreating the grandfather's past and explaining to us how the 12 gifts came to be. I loved his story and how he had to work very hard to get to where he wanted to be. In contrast, too many young people today expect everything to be handed to them on a silver platter, and they don't want to work for anything they want. There needs to be more movies made like this so we can get the point across to the younger generations that it's not all about them, life is about loving each other and creating a legacy that we can be proud of. So whenever someone asks me what I want out of life, I know what I'm going to say now, \"I want to leave a legacy. I want to be remembered long after I'm gone. I don't want to just float through life, I want to make an impact.\" I would highly recommend this movie to anyone wanting to see something different from the usual garbage that is shown in theaters.",
         "After reading the series I was very excited to find that films had been made. My husband and I really like the Ultimate Gift although it left out parts of the book, it was still a wonderful movie. So I rented The Ultimate Life without hesitation and when we sat down to watch it, I wanted to scream! I was really looking forward to seeing court case of Jason against his greedy relatives and all I saw was a bi-op of Red's life. Did the director even read this fantastic book? He couldn't have, because he didn't do it justice at all. I was peeved that Drew Fuller wasn't in this film but little did it matter since Logan Bartholomew wasn't much in it as well. What a let down to a life changing book. This series deserved better.",
         "It's probably not something that would blast the box office open, but its a notch above others that I've seen. It's definitely worth watching. I enjoyed this movie enough to write a review because: 1) It's totally CLEAN. Absolutely nothing lewd or inappropriate. I would watch a movie for this alone, given how rare it is. 2) Plenty of amazing looking guys, yum. :) 3) A positive, not overly cheesy, message. At first, I was worried it was gonna be one of those dogmatic, preachy, \"Christian\" films or something... 4) The film leaves a \"feel good\" feeling that stays with you. 5) It's good enough to watch again, with family or friends. Nothing too scary for the young kiddos. 6) Pretty decent, interesting storyline and plot, definitely wasn't bored watching it and rooted for the characters the whole way. 7) Has a good, satisfying ending, and not depressing. I hate movies where you feel bittersweet and left hanging at the end. 8) Was really beautifully shot for an \"average\" movie. Wait, maybe the movie wasn't so average, after all, haha. You won't regret watching this, unless you're just not into sweet romantic, inspirational, rated PG family films. :)"
