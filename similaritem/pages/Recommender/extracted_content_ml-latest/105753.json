         "Danish director Ole Christian Madsen must have felt the need for a change of pace and setting from his usual style. While his other films are tight, well-composed dramas, SuperClásico benefits from a loose, more free flowing construction and as the film plays out you realize that style and mood are a perfect match. This film is in no way groundbreaking, nor is it meant to be. The title is a comment on the film itself, and the characters are all acting as they're supposed to be in a dramedy of this kind. However, you can't help but to be engaged in the story, mainly because of some great performances and the beautiful Argentinian settings. All the supporting actors work well, without ever being more than 2-dimensional, as the character development is reserved for the main players. Especially Anders W. Berthelsen does a great job at conveying a man who's nearly given up on life until he is introduced to a change of scenery. SuperClásico is recommended if you're looking for a sweet film with just the right amount of sentimentalism and temperament. It will in no way rock your world, but it's damn charming with very few weak moments. It recalls the feeling from Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Lost in Translation a little bit.",
         "It is definitely not politically correct either. The movie that centers between a failed relationship and the consequences (which result in traveling) of the same. The main actors are really good and you buy into the situation they are in. Don't get me wrong, the movie is uneven at times and it is anything but perfect, but it does entertain, if you let it to. The acting is superb and the dialog is on the spot too. There are not too many easy answers to be found and while it might go into a direction you expect it to go, it might still be able to surprise you (not only in the end that is). If you like a smart little comedy, than this is for you"
