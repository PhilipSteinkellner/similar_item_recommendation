         "After the success of \"Die Hard\" there have been many movie clones of that great action film. There was \"Die Hard on a Ship\" (\"Under Siege\"), \"Die Hard on a Train\" (\"Under Siege 2\"), and \"Die Hard on a Bus\" (\"Speed\"), just to name a few. \"Sudden Death\" can be described as either \"Die Hard on the Ice\", \"Die Hard at a Hockey Game\" or \"Die Hard in an Arena\". You pick. Technically you could put all three titles into this movie and it'll still be pretty much the same thing. However, \"Sudden Death\" is one of the better \"Die Hard\" clones. It's an exciting movie about terrorists taking over the Pittsburgh Civic Arena where the decisive seventh game of the Stanley Cup Finals between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Chicago Blackhawks is being played. However there's a little difference here. The only people who know that hostages have taken over are the people in the VIP box (which includes the Vice President), the Secret Service men outside the arena, and an arena fire marshall who's two little kids are attending the game. The 17,000-plus fans attending the game have no idea whats really going on. That fire marshall is played by Belgian action star Jean-Claude Van Damme. I've not been a big fan of Van Damme's films, but \"Sudden Death\" is easily his best movie to date. Van Damme plays Darren McCord, the fire marshall who finds out something's wrong when his little daughter is taken to the VIP box as a hostage after witnessing a killing. When McCord finds out what's going on, he does precisely what Bruce Willis did in \"Die Hard\", takes on the terrorists all by himself. The lead bad guy is portrayed by Powers Boothe in a frightening performance. He may not be quite as effective as Alan Rickman's villain in \"Die Hard\", but Boothe does a good job at being mean. Van Damme is also very good too (especially in one scene where he poses as the Penguins goalie to hide out from the bad guys who were chasing him). He's much better here than he was in \"Timecop\", teaming again with \"Timecop\" director Peter Hyams. The action scenes are splendid (both the gunplay and the action during the game), and the suspense has you on the edge. \"Sudden Death\" has a few silly moments here and there, but since this movie is such a good thrill ride, you won't care. This movie deserved to be a big hit at the box office and wasn't. I'll never understand why. ***1/2 (out of four)",
         "I found this to be a very interesting action with with Powers Boothe fun to watch as the main villain, thanks to his dialog and no-nonsense approach. At least he wasn't one of those talk-first, shoot-maybe-later clich√©s from the world of film. The hockey scenes in here are realistic, too. However, the rest of the film doesn't exactly exhibit realism: lots of hokey stuff in here, too. At the end, the action really gets carried away and brings the rating down on this to a manageable \"7.\" Otherwise, it would be a minimum of \"8\" just for the entertainment value alone. After a slow start, it picks up when Boothe enters the movie. Then it never lets up. If you want a pure hour of action, this is it. There is no female lead in this movie, so you get no romance nor gratuitous sex scenes, which is a bit unusual. It's a straight crime story. One note: unless things have been changed, I was disappointed my DVD did not offer a widescreen version.",
         "I may be one of those movie buffs who's at least willing to confess that they're not a huge admirer or fan of a certain actor or director. Jean-Claude Van Damme would be near the top of my list of actors that I only admire although I've seen a few films where he has his name is on the poster. \"Sudden Death\" is the second film that Van Damme has starred in with photographer/director Peter Hyams (\"End of Days\", \"Timecop\") is at the helm. This film was based on an actual story by Karen Baldwin and is adapted into the story by Gene Quintano. The movie takes place at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena in Pittsburgh where the Chicago Blackhawks and the Pittsburgh Penquins are about to take the ice for the last game of the Stanley Cup finals. Van Damme's character, Darren McCord, takes his son and daughter to the game. As usual, the arena is packed with fans and the Vice President of the U.S. has come to see the game as well. Unfortunately, Joshua Foss (Powers Boothe), a demented terrorist and a small band of terrorists take control of the Owner's box where the V.P. and several people. Foss demands that he wants a billion dollars and how he wants to use it puzzles me. However, at the end of each period, if his demand isn't met, Foss shoots someone and if the deal isn't done at the end of the game. The arena is blown sky high with several explosives that are set all over the arena. Boothe is good here and he makes the threat very real, which is key to making any thriller. He also shows some wit and in one particular scene, the Vice President curiously asks Foss \"What kind of lunatic are you?\" Foss responds - \"The best kind.\" What draws McCord into the situation is when his daughter is taken up to the Owner's box. From there on, the movie manages to make the excitement to be interesting. One example would be the fight scenes that McCord has with a couple of thugs in the kitchen at two seperate times. Just about every prop is used from the meat slicer to the bone, which goes through one of the neck of a terrorist. Fun and yucky isn't it? The last half of the film is just about entertaining as the first half is. I'm undecided if \"Sudden Death\" would make the best thriller that involves a sports event and terrorists since John Frankenheimer's \"Black Sunday\". Van Damme and Boothe are both good here.",
         "Sudden Death is a well made movie,it has great action sequences,pretty good acting and a very high level of entertainment.The movie starts out really well,and ends really well.Van Damme gives a great action performance,and his co-stars do as well.Great action sequences,and a high level of entertainment makes Sudden Death a must see.",
         "Van-Damme is known for acting in two film genres: Action and Martial-Arts. His best martial arts film is BloodSport, also thought to be one of the best movies of all time in it's genre. This movie - Sudden Death - is his best action film. Great action scenes, some very hilarious scenes, and great overall action and suspense make this a great action movie overall. If you like action movies, you'll love this one. If you are a Van-Damme fan, this is a must-see. 9/10",
         "Sudden Death was a good action film. The plot was simple and easy to understand..It didnt try to become something it isnt and end up confusing you. Jean-Claude Van Damme gave a strong performance and so did Powers Boothe. He was extremely convincing as \"the bad guy\". The movie at times is a little far fetched..but most movies are. I also thought it was very cool how Jean-Claude's character used lots of odd objects to create weapons(Fire extinguisher, tube and darts)..anyway if your looking for a good action movie to watch, Sudden Death should be your choice.",
         "OK, let's be straight forward. This is not Oscar material. It's a typical hostage movie similar to the Die Hard series. There are some pretty decent action sequences and some that just don't plain make any sense and, after you see them, you will be left kinda confused. Having said that, this is a good movie. The best part about this movie is, surprisingly, the bad guy. Powers Boothe plays the lead terrorist and he plays it well. At times you root for him because he plays the part so well. Unfortunately, it's hard to root against this guy because of his wise-ass attitude, but some of his quotes are memorable and quite amusing. (Example: To the vice president \"I voted for you. I really did. It's your sincerity and compassion. However there may be a need to kill someone else. Now we're gonna make this work or we're gonna die trying!\") This is a typical Van Damme film except in this one he plays a little hockey. This movie, albeit a bit done-before, is surrounded by an entertaining cast that propels this from a 5 to a 7.",
         "Sudden Death just might be Jean-Claude Van Damme's best movie to date along with Hard Target,Bloodsport,Lionheart,and Cyborg!Powers Boothe is great and there is always action,great fights and interesting moments in the film!The film is very satisfying and entertaining and recommend for big time action fans!",
         "Darren McCord, a fire safety officer at a hockey stadium, takes his two kids to a major Pittsburgh Penguins game. It just so happens to be the day that extortionist/thieves kidnap the vice president and hold him hostage at the stadium, thus putting himself and his children in mortal danger. Lets cut to the chase here, Sudden Death is a clone rip off of Die Hard, the action template movie that shines as bright as a newly formed bruise, but as copycats go {and there have been reams}, Peter Hyams' beefcake blunderbuss movie is an action junkie's delight. Jean Claude Van Damme {McCord obviously} flexes his muscles and not only beats seven bells of tar out of Powers Booth's criminal minions, he also proves to be a hero and loving father to his oblivious children. It's contrived for sure, I mean we get Jean sneaking on to the ice and taking up net minding duties, and it's certainly a script devoid of imagination. But it's got Van Damme fighting a hot kick ass babe in a penguin suit and a last fifteen minutes of high roof/dangling/swinging/exploding mayhem that does the action genre proud. It's no Die Hard, but what genre films are? Sudden Death in spite of its contrivances, is a film that is impossible not to enjoy if you are a like minded adult. 7/10",
         "*MILD SPOILERS BELOW* Like most Van Damme vehicles, the action is hard hitting, the acting lame and the screenplay hilarious ! Most aspects of the story-line have been influenced by earlier hostage thrillers, especially Die Hard, the mother of them all. Take for example the scene where the foolish FBI decide to take matters into their own hands and send men into the stadium, strictly against the orders of the villain, quite well cast as 'Powers' Boothe. As they all run in from separate doors, their is a man sitting behind several surveillance cameras of the outer stadium, relaying their actions through his walkie-talkie to Boothe. Like the black man in Die Hard with his 'all was quiet on Christmas Eve, except 3 swat team members entering from the front' line. Some of the action scenes are well crafted, like Van Damme's entrance into the VIP box at the end, but most of the fights have far too many speedy cuts to make them enjoyable, instead they are just ultra-violent. If nothing else, some of Jean-Claude's moments of glory are highly comical, especially his facial expressions, which are completely OTT e.g. after saying 'come and get me' over the phone. Other notable bits of unintentional humour are; 1. Van Damme's ''educated guesses'' at where the bombs could be within the stadium, all of which are inch perfect, naturally. 2.The way in which Van Damme, THE FIREMAN, diffuses all bombs with ease. 3. One scene where the producers must have run out of dosh as it seems they couldn't afford to over-dub sound effects and old Claude has to, hilariously, make them himself with a throaty 'HUUGH'!! (during the 'sharp object up the arm' manoeuvre) So, all humour apart, this is a better than average flick which will keep you entertained due to its fast pace and moments of genuine tension. Just don't expect something as good as Die Hard, Under Siege, or Speed. Overall Rating: 7/10"
