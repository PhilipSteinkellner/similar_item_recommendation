      "reviews": [
         "This Italian film, following the travails of a young Jewish girl in a Nazi work camp, is successful due mainly to its realistic sets, and the performances of Strasberg and Terzieff. Supporting cast members also shine throughout the film. The whole concept of the \"kapo\" is new to me, and it added a further dimension to the horrific Nazi experience not covered in films such as \"Sophie's Choice\" and \"The Pianist.\" Deservedly, it was nominated for an Academy Award (Best Foreign Language Film) in 1960. Strangely enough, most filmographies of Strasberg fail to highlight her incredible performance in this film. Certainly, it must have reflected her performance as Anne Frank on Broadway. The same year as \"Kapo,\" George Stevens released his film version of \"Anne Frank,\" starring Millie Perkins, who took the role once Audrey Hepburn turned it down. Certainly, Strasberg must have been considered. A \"kapo\" was a prisoner of a concentration camp that watched over the other prisoners in a specified group. A kapo received better clothing, food, and was not required to work. 2001's \"The Grey Zone\" would be an appropriate double-feature with this film.",
         "Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1960, Gillo Pontecorvo's second film Kapo features Susan Strasberg as a Holocaust victim who decides that she will do anything to survive, even join the enemy. Kapo, which stands for Kameradenpolizei, refers to death camp collaborators who are recruited from the \"criminal element\" to supervise other prisoners in return for better treatment and more privileges. Pontecorvo, who fought in the Italian Resistance as a member of the Communist Party, presents a realistic picture of what life in a concentration camp must have been like but no movie can fully capture the madness and inevitably any attempt to dramatize it must take on aspects of melodrama. Strasberg, who had played the title role in The Diary of Anne Frank on Broadway several years earlier, portrays Edith, a 14-year old Jewish girl who is sent to a concentration camp with her parents when Jews are rounded up in Paris. After watching her parents die in the gas chambers along with other women and children, Sofia, a friend, introduces Edith to the camp doctor who provides her with a new identity as the non-Jewish Nicole. Cutting her hair and dressing her in the work clothes of a prisoner that died that morning, she is sent to a labor camp where she witnesses repeated horrors including the hanging of a young girl for alleged sabotage. Desperate to stay alive, she offers herself to a German soldier Karl (Gianni Garko). Although little about this relationship is developed, it leads to Nicole accepting the job of a Kapo, and the victim becoming a victimizer, brutally enforcing the camp's harsh rules on her fellow prisoners. It is only when she witnesses the suicide of a close friend Terese (Emanuelle Riva) and falls in love with Sascha (Laurent Terzieff), a Russian prisoner of war, that she is able to redeem the human values that had once been an integral part of her life. Much of this happens over a period of time but the passage of time is not shown and Nicole's transformation from a loving young girl to a bullying camp guard seems too quick and facile to be truly convincing, and there is little self-reflection in the process. The experience gained in this film, however, paved the way for Pontecorvo's masterpiece The Battle of Algiers, only a few years after.",
         "Only the survivors of the Holocaust can tell us what the concentration camp experience was really like, but Kapo is probably as close as cinema can get to recreating the numbing horrors of the camps--and that includes Schindler's List. Susan Strasberg is superb as Edith, the Jewish teenager who is saved by chance and then becomes a collaborator in order to survive. The film's greatest strength is its ability to make us comprehend the forces that compelled inmates to become kapos--the Nazi equivalent of prison trustees--and almost (but not quite) makes us sympathize with them. Snatched from the jaws of the gas chamber only to have the power of life and death thrust upon them, the kapos did what they had to do in order to survive--and who amongst us would not take that same chance if thrust into the heart of Nazi darkness. This incredibly powerful film is filled with astonishing imagery, none more powerful than the scene of Edith/Nicole watching helplessly as her parents are forced to jog to their demise amidst a crowd of children and elderly inmates--people who are inessential to the Reich's war machine. This important film, long forgotten in the United States, has now been unearthed by Turner Classic Movies, and hopefully a DVD is not far behind.",
         "Quite an excellent character study of what people will do to survive. Although not as powerful as other prisoner of war films such as \"Seven Beauties\" it stands out because of the performances of all the women and especially Susan Strasberg who does a magnificent job starting out as the young innocent girl, hiding the fact that she is Jewish, a bewildering task, and her agonizing evolution into a hardened guard. Don't look for huge sets and gruesome scenes of gas chambers and ovens here. It's not that type of film. It's a simple story of the slow chipping away of humanity that dire conditions force. Dignity and nobility give way to cruelty and inhumanity and simple survival becomes a thing to justify as time goes on. By telling this type of story through the eyes of a young impressionable person is excellent.",
         "I've never really liked holocaust flicks because they get well, usually made so that the dumbest of the dumb to 'get it.' Kapo is just a movie that shows, not tells, which of course makes the best story. Thanks to TCM for playing this gem that I'll buy on DVD as soon as it comes out. I'd never even heard of it, and I have seen a LOT of flicks. Susan Strasburg does an incredible job as Nicollete / Edith. Her transformation from shell-shocked victim to cynical survivor is absolutely gripping. The tension in the movie builds to nearly unbearable level and the end simply leaves you scooping your jaw off the floor. This is the type of movie I sorely needed after going on a loooong dry spell of celluloid garbage. Why this movie isn't famous, I have no idea, but it should be.",
         "I was not previously aware of this gem. I found it on TCM after it had already been on for about 10 minutes. I kept thinking that the lead actress looked just like SUSAN STRASBERG & for good reason. It was. The fact that it was foreign with sub-titles threw me initially. Very realistic, almost raw, which was surprising considering that this movie was made in 1959. STRASBERG as 'Nicole' works her way up through a concentration camp to become the woman in charge of her fellow prisoners. Strong language, violent situations, but this is a story about WWII, not the 'Enchanted Forest'. Good storyline, good direction, & a terrific performance by SUSAN STRASBERG that was all the more admirable when you realize that she was all of 20,21 when she made this.",
         "Edith\", (Susan Strasberg) is a French Jewish girl that during the Nazi occupation is detained in a concentration camp, fortunately achieves escape the gas chamber, and pretending to be a dam common is deported to a labor camp in Poland, where reaches the status of \"Kapo\" Extraordinary and unknown film by one of the pioneers of political film, He was always interesting director Gillo Pontecorvo. Film ahead of its time. It was one of the first films address without scruple, the theme of Jewish holocaust and one of the more realistic in its recreation. The first part of the film is more descriptive contains some scenes of prisoners being driven to the concentration camps and to the gas chambers, making it clear that seeks the script. The main actors and bit actors, all of them with some magnificent performances, and the historic value, up its main inducements, The music does not follow nor the rhythm, nor the level of the film. The history of love in the second half, in spite of entertain abandons the principles with which was conceived the production, and the same director recognize him later. The film is benefiting from a wonderful indent, and a remarkable ambiance, which transmits effectively the hardness of the concentration camps. Resume, the interest of the film lies in being one of the first that addressed openly the horror of the concentration camps, showing particularly the situation of women, and in which analyzes with great crudely psychological adaptation of \"Edith\" to a terrible reality It's a film essential for interested and scholars of the \"Holocaust\" during the \"WWII\".",
         "Although it features two French leads (Laurent Terzieff and Emmanuelle Riva) ,\"Kapo\" has disappeared from the French dictionaries of films whereas lots of duds are included. With the exceptions of \"Nuit et Brouillard\" (which was an exceptional documentary ) and Wanda Jakubowska 's \"ostatni etap' (1947) there were few movies which at the time broached the concentration camps subject(the last scenes of Dmytryk's \"young lions\" ,1958) Susan Strasberg was impressive ,mainly in the first hour though the evolution of her character is not always believable.Besides,her relationship with Sascha weakens the plot . Emmanuelle Riva almost outshines Strasberg,maybe because she was a more experimented actress (she was featured in Resnais's \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\" ) and her scene when she is translating the German words in a voice chocked with emotion may be the strongest in the whole movie. The \"potato\" scene is also revealing.I remember what Simone Veil ,a former French minister (secretary) (and herself a former prisoner in a concentration camp),said after watching the last episode of \"Holocaust \" (the seventies miniseries) : \"in the camps ,people were not as helpful ,as kind ,as compassionate as they are in the film\" .\"Kapo\" shows a very harsh world where the women are almost always fighting against their mates:that's the story of Edith /Nicole .",
         "A teen Jewish girl and her family are imprisoned in a concentration camp . There, the 14-years-old girl played by Susan Strasberg finds a harsh reality and changes identities with the help of the camp medic and rises to the position of Kapo. This is a good movie about the brutal existence at concentration camps and subsequent breakout from horrible place. This excellent movie deals about extermination center, abuse of camp guards or Kapos who enjoy their power, prisoners committing suicide and the subsequent getaway led by Laurent Terzieff and Russian prisoners . We see the horrors,murders,massacres against the prisoners and Nazis personify evil . Thus , when the incoming transports ,mostly Jews, SS soldiers made instant decisions,those who were fit to labors were sent into the camp, others including the children ,were dispatched immediately to the gas chambers.Finally the inmates broke out in a desperate riot that I believe it can be the concentration camp of Sorbibor, only in which Russian prisoners achieved to escape . The picture reflects perfectly the atrocities as a by-product of sheer Nazi evil . The flick is powered by splendid performances , as Susan Strasberg, -daughter of Lee Strasberg, creator of Actors studio- as suffering starring and Laurent Terzieff is watchable as obstinate Russian soldier wishing freedom. Appears as secondary actor playing a Nazi soldier Gianni Garco or John Garco, future Spaghetti Western hero named Sartana . Shot in magnificent black and white by Sekulovic and Carlo De Palma , Woody Allen's usual cameraman . Sensitive and atmospheric score by Carlo Rustichelli. The film achieved an Academy Award nominee for Best Foreign movie but lost to the ¨Virgin Spring ¨. This extraordinary and unknown film by one of the pioneers of political film , he always interesting director Gillo Pontecorvo. It was one of the first films about the theme of Jewish holocaust and one of the more realistic in its recreation . Gillo subsequently will directed ¨Battle of Argel¨ and ¨Queimada¨. The picture is based on real events and survivor's memories,these are the following : The large death camps were transformed into extermination centers to implement the policy of genocide thought at the Wannsee Conference (1942). There was some minor industrial activity linked to the war effort but the main work was the execution of inmates (as happen with the starring's family) . Victims (as Susan Strasberg and her parents) were brought to the camp in unventilated transports, and all but a handful were gassed after arrival,the gas chambers could accommodate hundred prisoners at one time using Zyclon B which was a crystallized prussic acid which dropped into death chamber ,most of their corpses were burned in open pits (as occurs at the ending of the movie when is opened a large hole to bury unfortunates).",
         "My journey with Gillo Pontecorvo started with The Battle of Algiers and continued with Queimada. Now I finally have the pleasure of going back to the movie that first cemented his position as one of the best directors ever, Kapo. Once again he's assisted by the great European screenwriter Franco Solinas, a man who has given so much to world cinema and yet remains forgotten. Kapo is not a movie about revolutions; it's perhaps Pontecorvo's most traditional and intimate movie since it doesn't concern the sweeping history of a country or conflicts between cultures. It simply follows Edith, a Jewish girl returning home after a piano lesson. She arrives just in time to be taken, with her family, by the SS. Through luck, a doctor creates a new, non-Jewish, identity, for her. Her family is sent to Auschwitz, but she goes to a labour camp, where she may survive. What follows is a slow transformation from a shy, innocent girl into a ruthless woman who'll do anything to survive. Her chance comes when she becomes a Kapo, or one of the inmates in charge of the other inmates. She's well fed, well clothed, she has some respect from the German soldiers and inspires terror in the other women. Susan Strasberg becomes the character, always captivating even when she's ruthless. She reminds me of Giancarlo Giannini in that other masterpiece about concentration camp prisoners, Pasqualino Settebellezze. This is a very bleak Holocaust movie because it paints a picture of the inmates that may leave some people uncomfortable. This is not Schindler's List, Life is Beautiful or The Pianist, all hard movies, but in which we see the people helping each other in a good spirit of comradeship. The reality of Kapo resembles more that of Primo Levi's Survival in Auschwitz, or Tadeusz Borowski's We Were in Auschwitz, objective, emotionless memoirs about what people would do to survive every day in a concentration camp, of how low they'd go in their degradation, of how their will to survive made them forget morality and decency. Although a bit dated, Kapo remains a great study of the worst side of human nature. The camp may seem a bit unrealistic nowadays as well as a love story that develops within its electric fences, but back then the concentration world wasn't as well studied as it is today. What remains is really a powerful story directed with craft and compassion."

         "Kapo is a black and white film that tells the story of a Jewish teenager sent to a concentration camp together with her parents. She manages to survive with the help of a Jewish doctor who gives her the identity of another woman who had died recently. Thus, Edith becomes Nicole and she is no longer a Jew, at least not in the papers. At first she is very sad about her parents' death but as time passed she realized she had to get out of that mood if she wanted to survive. So, she accepts an affair with a German officer even if she is only 14 and she starts getting privileges, becoming with time a Kapo, one of the women prisoners who were in charge with disciplining the other women. She knows it's the only way to survive but same time she lives in deep remorse even though she never shows any feelings.",
