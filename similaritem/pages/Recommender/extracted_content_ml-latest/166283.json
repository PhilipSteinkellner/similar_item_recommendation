         "content": "**The diary that found a homeless man.**\r\n\r\nIt's not what the title says. I mean it's not a sports film, but it has a little influence of that. Instead the title should have been related to the word 'diary'. Because that plays a main part in this narration. This is the story of a homeless man who one day finds a diary in the trash. The diary of a young girl who had lost her mother and living with her abusing uncle. So on, it reveals her unpleasant life, but he finds some similarities with her. So he writes the replies, but since he doesn't who she is and where she lives, it goes straight into the thin air as a paper plane. On the other side, he often makes money on the street fighting that one day does not go well. So after that where he ends is what brings the end to the tale.\r\n\r\nA much appreciable small budget film. Feels like a sentimental theme, but was not exploited so well. I have seen Thomas Haden Church in many flicks, but never in a lead role like in this one. He was the whole film, a couple of other characters come into the frame very often. So he was good, but expected a lot more than that. The blame goes to the screenplay, but also I liked the simple drama. Simple is quite enjoyable than too much of twist and turns and developments. So if you are the guy who takes chances in B movies, this is the one. Not the best film, though a heartwarming conclusion favours it. I know that part was a bit offbeat, but acceptable. So I say go for it.\r\n\r\n_6.5/10_",

         "Generally, I don't go for dramas much, and I really dislike long draw- out dramas. I watched Cardboard Boxer knowing zero about it apart from the title, and got totally sucked into the story. Its a story about a human being, not a \"homeless person\". It didn't dwell on the plight of the homeless, or try to preach about the class divide. I thought the movie made outstanding use of its unashamedly simplistic characters and setting to tell a very thoughtful story with a rich vein of truth and humanity at its core. I found much I could empathise with despite never having been anywhere near homeless myself. But yes, it is no more about \"bumfights\" than Romeo and Juliet is about hot-rods and Brylcreem. For people wanting to see that sort of thing, give this one a miss and skip straight to WWE. Whatever its shortcomings may be, this movie tackles some of the darkest places in the soul of man and still manages to bring the viewer through it feeling optimistic and uplifted without having to resort to anything as patronising as a 'happily ever after'. Cardboard Boxer touches on many facets of human-nature, but at its heart, it's a love story told through the eyes of someone so utterly alone that they have never even known anyone well enough to develop an unrequited crush, let alone fall in love. By rights, it should be the type of utterly depressing movie that makes me switch off after 10 minutes, but it was quite the opposite. That's a pretty neat trick Mr. Lee.",
         "This is the best feel good movie in years. If you have a heart, it will leave you breathless at times, emotionally exhausted, having laughed and cried, and then feeling so good! It is right on with the feelings one has in being homeless, as I too could not get out of my homeless circumstances, though I tried different cities and states, until in Florida, in utter hopelessness and desperation from years of this I begged a police officer in West Palm Beach to arrest me, but instead he took me to his home, became my biggest hero, and got me out of homelessness. But more importantly, buy this movie, don't rent it! It is a rare gem, and the best medicine for anyone who needs to feel good, and a move such as this one will heal the broken heart.",
         "I don't really care about any body else's review . I'm an Er doc and I've seen homeless people for most of my life and career.He did a great job showing there desperation and how they have been abandoned.These people are human beings not to be manipulated and deserve the same respect as everyone else.It's not a popular fad to help someone in need .It's a need we should inherently have to help our own species.What else have we become ?Not driven by media but by emotion . Not by government and programs but by the the individual who gives that person a hug ( the burnt child that gives Mr Church in the final scene) .Thank you ,if you ever read this Mr Church.",
         "First of all.... don't be fooled by the word Boxer. I generally get thrown off by movies about boxers as I feel this gerne his been swallowed, digested and eventually ended up in the sewer through a process we all privately enjoy. Anyways, I think this film portrays the fear of every human: Loose everything, become homeless and adapt to the street life. I could not imagine, can you? Where do you go? What do you do? What does one do for entertainment? What does one do for money? This film, I think, provides a great glimpse into the life of a homeless man and reveals hardship, friendship and the ups and downs one may or may not encounter. His love for his new found treasure, his thoughts, his emotions, his actions are captivating and intriguing. This movie will make you think, will make you appreciate, will touch your soul (I am a cold person and not easily touched or moved). Enjoy this movie over candle light, with your better half. Men have a chance to appear empathetic and sympathetic, while still getting a bit of violence in. Win win. Superb movie which will be greatly underestimated. Enjoy!",
         "This movie was just too much emotional. Easily one of the most touching movies i've ever seen. They way everything was portrayed i just went to tears most of the time in the movie specially when he asks to be human shield. No words to describe. Awesome acting and it made me feel as if i have lived as him , as a homeless. When a person lives as a normal person you probably forget about what type of life others might be living. Cardboard Boxer regardless of that titles lets you experience the life by a homeless person's view. Getting attached to the diary and considering it a friend and then pasting an image onto it since you just don't want to be alone. Getting money and feeding the dog just so he could be with you. It was truly a unique experience. It changes the way how you see homeless people out in the streets.",
         "A powerful and well acted movie. Thomas Hayden Church - Who? Was exactly the impression he left on me before this movie, then I looked the movie up here and clicked on his name because his face was familiar... oh ya, The Sandman from that weak spiderman movie and wings. Not really an impressive actor - Until This. The average person may not make if far through the movie because it removes them from their \"out of sight, out of mind\" comfort zone. When the pathetic kind of people who watch bum fights find out there's more to it than that, they will be less inclined to give it a shot, but they're beyond help anyway. The few with the constitution to watch this movie will not be disappointed. There's a kind of poetry in that I suppose... Just like this film. P.S. Remember - Food Banks can do MUCH more with money than you can at a supermarket, they can get produce fresh straight from farmers at waay better prices. Half the crap food donated has to be thrown out anyway, so do everyone involved a favor and donate money to food banks.",
         "This movie has a rating of only 6.4 while much worse movies get 7.0 or higher. Incredible. Is the audience that brainless, or do dirty producers hire Indian/Bangladesh companies to pump up their ratings, and decrease ratings of their competitors? This movie is the real thing. Not some propaganda crap. It shows all the \"glory\" of war and veterans, life on the streets, crime, and the corruption of the government. It shows unpleasant stuff, things hidden from the media, so that ordinary people wouldn't see the reality. For those who expect big explosions and car-races, this is not a movie for you. This one is much slower. But it grabs you. Because it's so real.",
         "It's a hard movie to fully understand, let's say that. The movie was truly a roller coaster of emotions. Not everything made sense like why couldn't Willie read cursive or how did Pinky die (Btw that scene was so heart-breaking), but has a complete backstory behind it. So far, this is one of the movies I have watched in 2016 that haven't suck. Summary: Willie, a homeless man, is lost in emotions until he finds a diary from the disposal of a house fire. Willie reads through it, but it's in cursive so he meets Pinky to help him read it. Pinky's story is more complete than Willie's being that he was a purple heart veteran and has PTSD from a horrific event. Don't want to spoil what happens to Pinky, but Willie has to fight his own friends( the homeless) to survive out in the streets. After his friend's death, Willie feels lonely like he did something wrong, that he was nothing. Money coming from rich teens who love messing around with the hopeless. Willie soon loses it and wants to sacrifice himself to the army to use as a \"human shield\". The Military thankfully decline. After one of the teens try to burn his diary to make him fight, he goes to the hospital from burn marks. There, he recites the first log of the diary. Someone hears him and listens. I'm glad she wasn't dead, as I thought he was talking to no one. Major Spoiler.... He recovers after a certain time span, and sees a recognizable girl. The girl from the diary. They hug, as Willie was her angel her mother sent for her. Response: People say the story doesn't make sense, but once you analyze it, everything falls into place. I usually don't do reviews, but this movie inspired me. Btw I hate how the trailer reveal the ending. Just why you know.",
         "This movie really had me emotional at some scenes and i cried because i could feel the emotions that Willie was feeling. I loved how the young girl and him found each other as if it was since he started to read her diary and it was just a coincidence that she was in the same hospital as her. What would be nice is that Willie could have socialized more with the other homeless folks, i mean he didn't fight the old man but lost the diary, i mean man that was a bullet to the heart because he mentions the book as her, his friend. I wish we can see an ending to this with the little girl, maybe that they live together scavenging for food,saving up money and doing good deeds to other people.",
         "I decided to watch this movie on a day which I had nothing else to do. Some (like the only other one to review it) May have come to view the movie regarding homeless people fighting. However IMO the name of the movie is quite misleading. I see the film as a personal in-depth drama of a homeless man who at first wants to feel better about himself. He starts off by reading a young girl's diary to help pass the time. He ends up growing fond of this diary. However due to fighting other homeless guys, he starts feeling worse and wishing harm upon his self. I will say the ending did have me in tears. I will not give it all away but you can about guess how it ended. IMO for the kind of movie it is, it was very touching and really should be watched with an open mind and not focused on the fighting.",
         "Worth watching if for no other reason than its raw depiction of life \"on the nickel' this is an unusual film. Its antihero, lured by a mere $50, embarks on a course of action pretty much guaranteed to lead to a falling out with the community. I've heard that the majority of homeless people are suffering from mental problems, and this aspect is played nicely by the actors here. And it is a community; this was the part of the film that surprised me most, the parallel world of the homeless, in which street sex is freely available, $5 gets you a b.j. and pussy costs $5 more. The movie is pretty much plot less, except for a rather unbelievable bolted- on ending that failed to convince me. Still, if you like grit and grime, give it a try.",
         "I watched this movie not knowing a thing about it and was incredibly moved by Thomas Haden Church's performance.....he deserved an Oscar. The story touched my heart and moved me to tears several times. I also enjoyed Terrence Howard's performance. I like him better in these gritty kind of roles! Wonderful movie.",
         "Thomas Hayden Church plays Willie, a homeless man with a little missing in the head. Based on the title of the movie, the film was about Willie getting paid by some rich kids to fight other homeless people for their entertainment. The other star on the poster, Terrance Howard plays a man who was able to get himself off the streets and comes back to help those he left behind, trying to seek out these rich kids and stop them from exploiting the homeless. The richness of the film comes from Church trying to keep his mind straight, and doing this after coming across the diary of a young burn victim writing about the experience. He finds comfort writing letter to her inside the diary. Overall the film does a great job of making you look differently at the homeless. It get inside the mind of a man living on the streets, and it does not try to figure him out, just make him human. However, the movie does clean up far too well, and somehow this takes away from completely getting under your skin about the situation. It's a well driven vehicle for Church, especially with Howard riding shotgun, but it does not have the emotion needed for people to go out and see it.",
         "Greetings from Lithuania. \"Cardboard Boxer\" (2016) kinda reminded me a bit of \"Time Out of Mind\" (2014) - similar themes and surroundings. \"Cardboard Boxer\" is not bad at all character study movie (a bit), but \"Time\" was better in this category, but it wasn't such emotional as \"Boxer\". Although no awards will shine for acting in this movie, i liked the performances by Thomas Haden Church, Terrence Howard and Boyd Holbrook as Pinky - he could have stayed on screen longer. Directing was nice as well as script. This is well paced movie - at running time 1 h 25 min it doesn't drag. Overall, \"Cardboard Boxer\" is a nice little movie which will unfortunately i'm afraid be overlooked by many. Although it doesn't have anything original or very well made, is not a bad movie overall for seeing it once.",
         "Cardboard Boxer is about a friendless man - Willy (Thomas Haden Church) without a home trying to make it with what he can scrape up. One day, he finds a little girl's diary in the dumpster, which he reads each day, and sometimes imagines a reply to her. He also befriends a war hero named Pinky, who is also homeless. The other half of this movie is about these twenty-somethings rolling up to the homeless alley offering up money for the homeless people to fight each other for money. There's this one big dude who'll fight but the only other person who's up for the challenge is Willy. Willy wins, thus earning him the champion name \"Cardboard Boxer!\" This continues throughout the movie. The leader of the twenty-somethings is JJ (Rhys Wakefield from \"The Purge\"). Thomas and Rhys each play their parts well. I feel like Rhys is going to be in many movies one day. I watched this movie on Netflix.",
         "This was a great movie. Great filming, great acting. It really explores the human condition in a different setting. Even though the setting is in the homeless arena, it still deals with the human need to belong, love, and be loved. It also shows how we are all connected in various and surprising ways. I think this is a must see movie that you don't want to miss.",
         "If you don't have a natural sympathy for the homeless there's nothing to see here. I felt the movie tries to give you: \"a day in the life of...\" kind of feeling. If you don't find yourself warming to the main character, again, turn it off. If you do warm to him though, it's an enjoyable ride. I did find moments where the film tries to make you feel something but you don't and a few little cracks which will need your forgiveness. (I agree with another review on here, the main 'baddie' is a little too cliché and, considering his proposed intellect, would have used a clever bit of manipulation psychology rather than something I've seen a thousand times before.) There are, however, hard hitting scenes where I responded emotionally whereas the movie took it's time, no dramatic music, no sentimentality. I loved those moments, really spot on. Great direction, script and acting. The end scene I felt was under cooked and could have done with a bit more air time between the characters in question. I just don't think their emotional bond was that strong - that the film was relying on my buy in instead. But all in all? Yeah, nice film, good acting, directing, script (for the most part, couple of forgives, no biggies) and it does what it's supposed to do. Enjoyed.",
         "I almost stopped watching after 10 mn because of the overwhelming feeling of insecurity. Yeah, I guess every unlucky can end up in the street. The most shoking event, is that Willy was not arrested for killing the, because no body cres for them.",
         "This is a bitter-sweet tear jerker about a homeless man named Willy (Thomas Haden Church) the title character. He is a loner and comes across a little girl's diary in a dumpster. She tells a sad story about her dead mother and living with an abusive uncle. She is alone and wants to die. Willy doesn't want to die alone and opens up. He befriends Pinky (Boyd Holbrook) a homeless vet in a wheel chair with a Purple Heart. The war has messed up his mind, and we never know fully why Willy is in his state, but we get clues. The title comes from the fact there are individuals who pay to film homeless people fight. Willy gets the nickname \"Cardboard Boxer\" to the dismay of Pope (Terrence Howard) a tough love cabbie who cares for the homeless on Fifth Street or \"The Nickel\" as they call it. The film was well acted. Cameos by Marlo Thomas, Macy Gray, Johanna Braddy (Levenger Tapes). Sad and heartwarming. Guide: F-word. Near sex. No nudity",
         "I watched this movie with my 18 yer old daughter, she's on a Boyd Holbrook high at the moment after seeing Logan. There were parts of it that broke me. The despair, the hopelessness the isolation that must come with being homeless. The scene in the store when the little girl says she can smell something bad had me emotional. When Willie tries to sign up for the army and feels so useless he is willing to be a human shield, anything just to belong, Pinky's death (although not sure what happened, hypothermia perhaps). I wanted to clock those two dopey teenagers around the head and ground them for life. A great film I would highly suggest to anyone who wants to watch a proper decent film, but don't expect a Rocky meets The Pursuit of Happiness. It isn't a boxing movie and it isn't a rags to riches story, it is raw, and real and sad.",
         "What more can I say, this is such a superb film in every aspect. I recommend you to also see The Saint Of Fort Washington(1993) which is another good film to watch along with The Inevitable Defeat of Mister & Pete(2013). There are two more films a little adult oriented, but have been highly acclaimed as among the best films ever made: Midnight Cowboy(1969) and Scarecrow(1973) and The Price Of Love(1995). There have been so many good films I have seen but I can remember them all because I saw them decades ago... This film is about a homeless person, Willie(Thomas Haden Church) who is also suffering from a mental illness. By all accounts, he should have been living in a government institute for the mentally challenged(and paid for by the government). But he finds himself among the homeless and hapless citizens who live out their existence on the streets under deplorable conditions. One day Willie finds the diary of a young girl among some trash. He finds a way to read it discovers finds something in common with the girl. She too thinks that she is all alone in the world, and she has been also cruelly treated by her guardian. Eventually the diary becomes a real person in Willie's eyes. Thrown into all this is the appearance of some teenage kids who bet on homeless people beating up each other in bouts of fist fighting. Willie accepts the challenge of the teenage kids in order to get money to buy some food. The teens capture the video footage of the fight and post it online. Soon Willie becomes something of a celebrity in their eyes and the refer to him as the \"Cardboard Boxer\". Watch the film to see what happens next. If you are a sentimentalist, keep a handkerchief at your side because there were many instances in the film where I broke into tears. Thanks for reading my review, may you live long and prosper. You might also like these films: A Cry in the Wild(1990) and Surviving The Game(1994).",
         "Wow! This movie was a great movie to watch. From start to finish I was into this movie. Great cast to bring this movie to life. I would say one of the best movie of the year. You can tell the director wanted to have a different take on the subject matter. I seen movies like this before but this one was a serious take. I cry at the end. I like the main character acting was on point. The title had you guesting what this movie going to be about. I highly recommend it. You do have to think about it, have a heart, and an open mind especially T. Howard's character part. He one of the characters in this movie. Not the first T. Howard's movie he done like this. He was great. Great guessing movie to choose to watch. If you hate this movie maybe its not your cup of tea or you just don't know a good movie when you see one. This could happen in a real life situation. I do know a funny movie this reminds me of. This was as good as that movie.",
         "Thomas Haden Church nailed it as a homeless person. Very convincing acting. This movie showed to me that everyone (even homeless people) want their lives to count for something....at least being a friend to at least one person. I will in the future acknowledge homeless, and try to find some way to show their lives matter.",
         "I attempted to watch what I thought would be a meaningless time passer movie before bed.... I ended up watching a real solid attempt at an emotional movie.. I found my self falling deeper into the pain this movie portrayed. From the first 5 minutes to the last 5 minutes I was fully committed to what this movie has to offer. A film like this really shows a person how hard some people have it and what we all take for granted.. The weak and nieve get prayed upon by the \"superior\" but in the end we are all human and are capable of amazing things... Most viewers will see the title and move right on by thinking it's just another .50 cent cheap thrill, that lately has seemed to over saturate the movie industry. This is not that kind of movie. Enjoy it as I did and come away feeling pretty blessed about how lucky you have it.",
         "This film has been under-rated. Cinematography, acting, and set designs are very powerful. This film will change how you view the homeless populations of the inner cities of the world. This is not just a film, it is a masterpiece depicting the human condition. Open your eyes and pay attention! This could be be about your brother or it could be about you. A must see for anyone with compassion. I know because I have seen it first hand. IT'S ABOUT THE IGNORED, UNSEEN, and dismissed people and families who live beneath the overpass you cross every time you drive to the store. Bravo, well done. Films this powerful and well conceived are few and far between."
