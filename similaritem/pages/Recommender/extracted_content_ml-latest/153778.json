         "I hate to see people slam this movie for its clichéd plot, hamming performance by its actors and its music. First of all, this is a switch your brains off and enjoy movie. Emraan Hashmi plays the bad boy here and gets to romance the pretty Esha Sharvani who is a geek, his mannerisms and weird clothing styles are laughable. He gets to coach Tushar Kapoor who is the Good Boy here, to help get the bad girl . Yup, we've seen this plot a 100 times, but the way the whole story plays out in typical bollywood style is crazy. We have the goons who get thrashed, a principal of the college and lots of other sidey actors who add to the frame. The music by Himesh Reshammiya compliments the movie perfectly. The songs appear when you least expect them to and feature run of the mill lyrics. Overall, this movie is the Indian American Pie, I have this DVD in my shelf and whenever I feel dejected and low, this movie makes me realize that things could be worse, much much worse! Mark my words, this movie will attain cult status with time and is one of Emraan Hasmis best performances in a teen comedy.",
         "If you have plenty of time to kill and the DVD was given to you by your friend for free but still it may require lot of courage to watch this film which does not have good script or humor for that matter. On the acting front imran is frozen in time/acting, Tushar Kapoor was slightly better than Imran in this movie Paresh Rawal was good at comedy was usual. The story revolves around a college campus where Imran is a bad boy n Tushar is the good one, they pretend to be the opposite of respective nature and so the story goes on..... Watch it only if you don't have any thing to do and the film is running on your local cable TV.",
         "Wow. As soon as I saw this movie's cover, I immediately wanted to watch it because it looked so bad. Sometimes I watch Bollywood movies just because they're so bad that it will be entertaining (eg. Koi Mil Gaya). This movie had all the elements of an atrocious film: a \"gang of local thugs\" that is completely harmless, a poorly done motorcycle scene, horrible dialouge (\"Congrats son, I am very proud that you are a Bad Boy\"), actors playing basketball as if they are good, atrocious songs (\"Me bad, me bad, me bad bad boy\"), unexplained plot lines like why are the Good Boy and Bad Boy friends??? And why is the hot girl in love with the nerd?? I've never seen such a poorly constructed story with such horrible directly. Some of the scenes actually took 30 seconds long like the one where the Good and Bad Boys inexplicably ran over the \"gang member's\" poker game. Congrats Ashwini Chaudry, you are a Bad Director. If you want to watch a good movie, watch Guru, if you want to watch a movie so bad that it's actually entertaining, then watch Good Boy, Boy.",
         "It takes me back in time....just love it.... actually you don't need to (should not) use your brains while watching it.... the movie taught me a very important lesson , smart girls fall for bad guys and bad girls fall for geeks.... love this movie.... perfect actors have been used for the characters.... the scene where tushar receives tanushree's call was perfect ....it perfectly portrayed how one feels when they fall in love for the first time.... one of the best romantic comedy.... there's really something wrong with people criticize this movie and hate it.... i mean its a 'shut your brains and watch' movie..... plus it shows the perfect picture of a college life ... there are not many college life movies in Bollywood, so appreciate it....",
         "The story of Good Boy Bad Boy revolves around an ideal teacher and two students (one termed as the 'Good Boy' and another termed as the 'Bad Boy'). The story is set in a college marred by indiscipline of the students. It is joined by a new principal - Deewaan Chand Awasthi (Paresh Rawal) who once used to be a student of this college. Mr. Awasthi firmly believes that there is nothing like absolute badness in a student. It's the goodness which needs to be identified and nurtured in every student because it exists in everybody in one or the other form. He starts working on the basis of this philosophy of his and divides the students of every class into three sections (A, B and C) on the basis of their academic performance, nature, aptitude and personality. However it does not happen in case of two students - Raajan Malhotra (Tushaar Kapoor) and Raaju Malhotra (Emraan Haashmi) who get sections quite opposite to their actual status. The so-called Good Boy - Raajan is sent to section C whereas the notorious Bad Boy - Raaju is sent to section A. Awasthi does it under the pretext of interchange of names (the identity cards of both of them read 'R. Malhotra') but the truth is that he deliberately wanted to do it because he wants the Bad Boy to shed his bad habits and start taking interest in studies whereas on the other hand, he wants the Good Boy (who is actually a book worm) to be a bit extrovert and start taking interest in extra-curricular activities to develop an all-round personality. And he succeeds in the end when the desired improvements are visible in the personalities of both these boys and both of them can be termed as good boys now. Despite being copy of a Hollywood movie - Class Act (1992), the story is good but the director Ashwini Chaudhary and the producer (and perhaps the ghost director) Subhash Ghai could not restrain themselves from forcing regular Bollywood formulae into the screenplay and thus spoiling the very objective and mood of the movie. Until you set the commercial angle aside at least for some time, you can't do justice to a noble theme chosen for the movie. And that exactly happened with this badly made good movie. The movie fails to impress upon the audience its theme and objective and appears just like another regular and average potboiler made to draw the college-going youths as well as the permanent front-benchers to the theatre. The movie as well as its main protagonist is not able to clarify as to why a good boy is to be transformed into a not-so-good boy. Just to bring the extra-curricular talents of a book worm to the fore, there is no need to put him in the category 'C' when he deserves 'A' on the basis of his high academic performance, good habits and admirable nature. In section 'C' he is compelled to sit with the spoiled boys (and girls) who can be termed as the problem-children or rotten tomatoes. On the contrary, the Bad Boy is undeservingly put in the category 'A'. Is he rewarded for being bad ? Won't he spoil the environment of the section studded with studious and teacher-respecting cultured boys and girls by his uncalled for language, activities and behaviour ? The steps taken by the principal to instigate the desired changes in these boys appear to be childish. Besides, it appears that the principal is hell-bent upon transforming these two boys only and not the hundreds of other students in the college. Since there're two young heroes, there bound to be two young heroines too to play as their love-interests. Hence we have a Bad Girl - Dinky Kapoor (Tanushree Dutta) for the Good Boy and a Good Girl - Rashmi Awasthi (Isha Shravani) for the Bad Boy. The Good Girl is none else but the daughter of the principal himself. These poor heroines (especially the Bad Girl) don't appear to be knowing as to what they are expected to do (in addition to romancing with their respective heroes). Other than the principal and one lecturer (played by Abdullah Nasser), the characters of the teachers of the college are caricaturesque. All the same, I feel that the message rendered is good though not conveyed properly. Every boy or girl is good from origin and it's the duty of his / her guardians on one hand and his / her teachers on the other to first identify and then exasperate and nurture what is good in him / her. Labelling is easy. Helping that boy / girl to get rid of that undesirable tag is difficult. And unfortunately, most of the teachers follow the easier path because they do not want to take any pains to follow the difficult path which ultimately leads to highly positive result - positive for the individual, positive for the institution, positive for the concerned student's family and positive for the society at large. The movie underscores the significance of the role that can be played by the family members of a 'Bad Boy' in reforming him. If he takes a positive step, at least his family members should forget the tag of Bad Boy attached to him and appreciate him, boosting his morale for going further ahead in the right direction. Though almost all the reviewers had termed it as sheer trash, I do not think so. In my view, despite flaws, this movie is a one time watch for the purpose of entertainment. It does not inspire (which it should have considering the theme chosen) but it definitely entertains and does not compel the audience to look at their watches. Plus those who aspire to join the teaching profession and rise in that, should sincerely study the character of Principal Awasthi of this movie and attempt to follow his thought-train and approach.",
         "Can u believe a college professor made this film????? The same man who made DHOOP The film is horrible and has some of the weird scenes ever The main message is nice but presented badly The film looks like a collage of amateurish scenes, miscasts.etc and bad performances Direction and everything is poor Music is okay Emraan's naughty streak works and he does well Tusshar is bad Tanushree and Isha are bad Paresh annoys when he looks at the mirror",
         "most people did not even bother to give the film a chance and needless to say it was one of the year's many Bollywood flops. But not withstanding, 'Good Boy, Bad Boy' was actually watchable. Okay, so I know it would be quite hard for anybody at this point to get past the fact that once the title songs begins to play and you begin to get a feel of where the storyline is leading, it's really hard to get over the fact that Emraan Hashmi (as Raju Malhotra) and Tushar Kapoor ( Rajan Malhotra ) are playing high school students. But honestly, if you can suspend your disbelief for half a second or more then you're in for a semi-treat as these two showcase their decent acting abilities and great chemistry for two and a half hours of lies, heartbreak and redemption. Kapoor's Rajan is the studious good boy, while Hashmi's Raju is the notorious bad boy. The film opens to a rally where we meet Hashmi looking much like himself, aided by a scantily clad Tanushree Dutta (as Dinky) egging their fellow students on in a campaign for shorter skirts and more recess. When their current faculty refuses to give in to their demands, the students trash the school and a new principal is brought in to replace the present one. This new principal is played by Paresh Rawal (Principal Diwan Chand Awasthi). He arrives and immediately begins to rule with an iron fist, even going as far as to suspend two students who jokingly call him boring. In the midst of all of this, are two blossoming love stories. Bad girl Dinky has her eye on good boy Rajan, while bad boy Raju has his eye on good girl Rashmi (played by Kisna's Isha Sharvani) who also happens to secretly be the principal's daughter. One day, the principal decides to separate the students into classes according to how well they are doing in school. And like this plot twist, rather unpredictably Raju and Rajan's identities get mixed up. When the good lands where the bad is supposed to be and vice versa, the two decide to play it for all its worth. That is until they get caught, or do they? LOL! It wasn't the best of films, but I enjoyed it for all it was worth.",
         "I am an Indian residing in the United States. Why India continues, like a dumb animal, to emulate everything American is beyond me!! The main problems with the movie aren't so much the inane plot and dumb comedy. It is that this movie has a lot of debauchery, touching, women dressing like strumpets in the streets, and a lot of cursing that doesn't belong anywhere on T.V. To the producers and directors of this movie, I have this message: You continue to weaken our nation's strong family values by making this sort of junk. You continue to let young women think it's okay to have a feminist attitude and have no morals. You continue to make dance songs that belong in the lowest of adult clubs and bars. I am ashamed to be an Indian after seeing movies like this. In 2003, the United States government suggested that the best way to destroy Iran is to 'send miniskirts' there. There is no need to do that for India. We will destroy ourselves with rubbish like this.",

         "Born on April 18, 1985, Rajan Malhotra lives a wealthy lifestyle along with his disapproving dad, Prem and mom in Bandra, Mumbai. He studies in B.S.S. College of Arts & Science, is very studious, attains good marks in all subjects, except in sports. Fellow-collegian Raju Malhotra, born on February 21, 1985, lives a wealthy lifestyle along with his strict, disapproving dad, mom, and an unmarried sister, Kavita, in Mahim, Mumbai. Raju is the opposite of Rajan, does poorly in studies, but is a trouble-maker, a slacker but good in sports. When Diwan Chand Awasthi takes over the College as the new Principal he decides to separate the students into three groups, (A for ones who score 70% or more; B for those who score from 50% to 70%; and C for those who score under 50%). Raju clearly falls under 'C' but as he has given his heart to pretty Rashmi, who is an 'A' student, he decides to switch his photo Id. card with that of Rajan, who readily accepts this challenge as he is basically a nice guy. Raju wins over Rashmi's heart with Rajan's help, while Rajan slowly starts falling for 'C' student, Dinky Kapoor. Both Raju and Rajan will face new challenges when Dinky's boyfriend and his gang decide to get nasty, and to complicate matters further Principal Awasthi asks Raju and Rajan to participate in a quiz and dance competition respectively - knowing fully well that neither one is likely to succeed.",

While Raju Malhotra has absolutely no time for studies as playing notorious pranks on others takes up most of his time on a daily basis. His father constantly ridicules him for his wayward ways.. As fate would have it, both of them land up in the same college. And get swapped. And fun begins.",

Unfortunately there is a mix up between the ID cards of Rajan and Raju Malhotra; while Rajan end up in C class Raju end up in A class. Rajan attempt to bring this to Awasthi's attention but he is approach by Raju who convince him to let it be as it is as his beloved Awasthi's daughter, Rashmi is studying in A class. While in C class Rajan happen to captivate the attention of his classmate, Dinky Kapoor and both fall in love; unfortunately Awasthi gets to find out about the mix-up between the Malhotras and decides to arrange for an examination that will bring their true colors to light but this does not help prompting Awasthi to enroll Rajan into a dancing competition and Raju into a quiz competition.
