         "The '6 Schwedinnen' (six Swedish girls) from the title clearly had no need for further sexual education (that was completed in their previous adventure '6 Schwedinnen im Pensionat') and now they have to work for a living. As petrol station attendants! Their customers can expect to be treated very, er, lovingly, in fact the girls seem to make love to all their customers. Such loving care is sadly lacking regarding the safety of the whole enterprise. While the customers are attended to, inside the station, the completely unattended petrol pumps keep running and are highly likely to overspill - one of the rare situations in which premature ejaculation can save your live, because you might just get back in time! To top it all, several of the girls are heavy smokers. Miraculously nobody gets hurt. That alone would not really fill 90 minutes, and so we are also subjected to the shenanigans in the local council. If a councillor comes late to a meeting he is probably bedding the mayor's wife - she's doing them all in turn. And then, unconnected to anything else, there is this strange TV set that can do more than just broadcast a picture. By sitting firmly on top of it, our Kerstin (France Lomay) allows the man inside the TV to climb out and into her crotch. (If you must ask: of course, there ain't any special effects.) The wackiness of it all keeps it just about watchable.",
         "I had a really good time watching this movie. This is definitely a movie for entertainment only. Nothing serious here. This would make a nice movie to break the ice on a first date. If you're not used to euro movies, the explicitness is a bit of a shocker. With no cut away scenes,the actors/actresses dis-robe and mount each other. The camera shows every possible part of the love scenes just short of penetration. The girls run a full-service gas station. And full-service is what the patrons get. The girl have fun and watch erotic movies and do typical girl stuff. The mayor has his hands full with a overly generous wife, however don't feel sorry for him until you see the movie. The movie is worth buying, but it is more of a collector's item. This movie pushes the limits between softcore and hardcore, in a funny way."
