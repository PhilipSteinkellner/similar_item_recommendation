         "There's nothing much to say about this one - no point, no reason, no entertainment. The premise is OK, but it gets boring after about the second deed and there is ten of them so do the math... All characters are very underdeveloped and you literally know nothing about them, you think that American pie knock-offs(and if you think it's not a knock off you seriously need to see a doctor, because it makes that crystal clear from the first minute of the movie) would get at least the basics right, but this one fails even at that. There's some weird thing going on with the nudity in this movie where in some parts it acts like it's PG-13 and in other ones - a big red R, I didn't get that at all, my guess is that something probably got mixed up during the editing... The message near the ending is horrible and idiotic too. So skip this worthless mess of a film, go re-watch American pie, hell, re-watch Porkys while you at it, seriously, there's no comedy to be found in this one, guys, JUST SKIP IT.",
         "Dirty Deed's It's a fun and cool movie, really exciting to watch, but I believe that overall this movie is just another Cliché High-school comedy, everything you'd expect from one of these movies, and what you see is what you get, but don't label this move for what it is, I think it's awesome and the best High School movie out there. Watch pretty boy Zach go over the most grotesque, weird and amazing deeds and have fun watching it. Don't believe all the Up-tights reviews and rates you see out there for this movie, I think that they are way to low for what this movie truly deserves, but you be the boss, I say you give this movie a chance. I would have no problem watching this movie again and again, by myself or friends, If you ask me it's laugh out loud.",
         "This movie is as funny as starring at a wall for several hours.The people who say this movie is funny were obviously stoned out of there mind to the point where making a dumb face or noise is funny. The acting...well there's no word to describe how bad the acting is in this movie.It seemed as if everyone was just standing around reading their lines out of the script.It was so bad I was actually waiting for a scene where they could be seen holding the script. Some of the deeds concepts were very good and could of been very funny.However the acting was so bad and the actors seemed so uninspired that my face actually cringed several times when the movie attempted to be funny , and eventually got stuck like that for the entire movie. Anyone who says this movie is funny should seek help or lay off the drugs.",
         "Save yourself the 2 hours (or however long it was, too long in my opinion) and watch something better than this trash. Dirty Deeds is called an \"American Pie like comedy\" but comes absolutely NOWHERE NEAR CLOSE to American Pie. A bunch of high school seniors come together as one brave senior attempts to complete every \"dirty deed\" as per tradition requests. Some of which include ejaculating into bread, stealing a car (OMG these kids are bad to the bone), and finding the only other grad to complete the deeds. The film is revolved around this plot, and many, MANY unnecessary sub-plots which it could have easily gone without. First off, the sub-plots are completely unnecessary and add absolutely nothing to the story. One of which involves a freshman wanting to get with an attractive senior girl, but fails, then (go figure) gets with her! Sweet lord I didn't think it would happen! No no no, in Dirty Deeds, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE! EVEN STEALING A CAR WORTH MORE THAN $100,000 AND HAVING THE GUY WHO ACTUALLY OWNS IT NOT CARE THAT THE KID STOLE IT! The acting was horrible. Through another sub-plot we watch Zach try to get with Meg, and she keeps pushing him away because she wants to protect her brother who she thinks Zach is turning into a bad kid. Then at the end, we see Meg actually has feelings for Zach, WHAT A SURPRISE. Cliché love sub-plot in a teen \"comedy\"? Oh, you better believe it! What a joke. What a joke of a movie. I sat through this and couldn't wait for it to be over, I'd rather watch paint dry or snow melt. Anything is more entertaining than this garbage. 0/10. I wish IMDb had a lower rating system.",
         "It's end of High School year time and it's prank night!! Mix in porkys and all the other modern day high school movies and this is what you get. It's about a guy who takes on the 10 dirty deeds, it hasn't been done for years and the last person to complete them all was about 13yrs ago and for the last bunch of years no one has tried and before that some only managed to do a few. Has everything you expect, dorks, jocks, pot heads, white guys pretending to be black, house party thrown by a freshman trying to get in with the seniors, thick cops, boob shots, ditsy cheerleader types. and 10 pranks to be done by one guy All been done before and been done better, but still it's quite watchable.",
         "I really wanted to like this movie, and I do believe that a can appreciate a movie for what it is - but this movie just stinks... The script is lame and even the deeds are rather boring. The acting is terrible and the casting is even worse, like for example the Bad Jock who looks more than a make-up wearing drama student! All the typical stereotypes are in here, but they seem to know their stereotypes! I thought the concept was kinda interesting, but they didn't make it work, and then the movie is plagued by really unnecessary nudity (and for me to say nudity is unnecessary is a big shock!) So, lets sum it up \u0096 its not funny, don't bother with this one!",
         "This movie is great. I don't know what you think about high schools, but there has always been a generalization about them that is included in this movie. Have you not been to school, or are you just mentally retarded? These stereotypes do, in fact, exist to an extent. Wow, a movie exaggerates something, that's the first time that's ever happened! There are great parts within the movie that make you laugh, and although it isn't full of punchline type jokes the movie itself is funny. It is a great movie, full of suspense and situational humor. In the main review of the page, it was written that the person hosting the party ruined it with his acting. His eyebrows were moving apparently. Have you ever seen someone getting their house trashed? I'd suspect that they would be nervous. And if you've ever seen someone who's nervous, they often twitch. WOW! His eyebrows twitched, why watch the rest of the movie? What's the point?!?! Someone's eyebrows twitched! This movie was underrated, it was a great movie with a great plot and ending.",
         "This could have been your standard adult-teen-rom-com. But from the onset it reeks of indifference. The entire team moves through the movie like zombies, as if all they could care about is the paycheck at the end. Common how difficult is it to make a formulaic film and enjoy it???. We the audience enjoy it, we know what were getting into when watching such movies and more often than not.... we enjoy ourselves. But everyone in this movie comes across as bored but still trying to be cool. The premise of the movie isn't bad, 10 dirty deeds is more than what some movies have been made on, but the potential has been squandered. The stereotypes, which are critical for this genre, go through their roles with absolute lack of conviction. The energy levels are very low starting with the Protagonist who acts like he couldn't give a f^&k. The raunch levels are enough to get an R rating but not enough to being anywhere near gratifying. It doesn't help when all the wrong people are showing their boobs either. The finale is absolutely pointless and makes us feel like losers by deriding the very foundation that adult teen comedies are based on (people do stupid things once in a while ...and its OK). The only good thing going for this movie is that its short and you don't really ever get bored. -s misguided attempt at epic scenes, abysmal energy levels, shoddy acting. +/-s the protagonist is already the cool guy. +s short and doesn't really get torturous or boring. The ratings are more a function of the directors previous film which I consider one of the genre classics. The studios have punished him for this effort and we can contribute too by putting this movie low on our watchlist.",
         "An American Pie-like teen comedy in which a high school senior (Milo Ventimiglia) tries to become the first student in years to complete the Dirty Deeds, an outrageous series of challenges that must be completed by the Homecoming banquet at 9 a.m. The best thing about this film is the inclusion of Bowling for Soup's song \"Almost\". The second best thing is having Lacey Chabert in a supporting role -- she deserves far more screen time than she gets. Beyond that, it was hit and miss. Some have categorized it as a raunchy comedy in the vein of \"American Pie\", and I have to agree that this was probably the primary inspiration for such a film. However, I would say this one had a bit less raunch (despite the bread incident) and that gives it a bit more class in my book.",
         "There are people who gave this movie positive reviews. They are wrong. I'm not 30 minutes in, but short of the screen writer, director, DP,PAs, best boy and gaffer dying and being replaced by better people I see no sign of it improving. The actors are blameless because, though terrible, they needed the pay check. I started watching this movie not to see something mindless, but to see something bad. What i got surpassed my expectations of what bad could be. I'd rather watch a cherished family pet die slowly than watch this movie, but for science I will finish it. Please I am a hero, you are just a lowly civilian; do not try and do what I am doing. It will just end in tears."
