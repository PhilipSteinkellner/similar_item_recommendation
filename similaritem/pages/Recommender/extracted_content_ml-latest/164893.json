         "Well most of the cast of the film that shook the (movie) world is still back where they were when the movie was shot. Just because you are in a big movie, does not mean you made it. I had forgotten about Alice Braga I have to admit, but you can be surprised that some of the actors didn't make it bigger, since the movie was released. There are quite a few interesting interviews here and some behind the scenes footage (also casting videos and more). We get to see what some of the cast have been up to, and not all of them went good. You also have people who went criminal. The documentary shines a light on that too. I didn't research if the movie could have been more in depth. but for the running time, this is decent enough and interesting enough to watch. Especially if you were a fan of City of God (or even City of Men the TV show).",
         "This documentary film tells the life stories of the cast members in the ten years after the screening of the widely acclaimed Brazilian film \"City of God\". What makes this documentary interesting is that we get to see how a lot of people's lives turn out. They converged years ago to shoot a film, and then their lives diverged drastically. They talk about their salaries of their filming, what happened to them in the years, and what life is like now. It is interesting to hear them talk about the rush of going to film festivals and then the following day they crash back down to their homes in the favelas. That is quite heartbreaking already, but to top that up, some cast members resort to the life of crime just to keep themselves afloat, and some even turn to drug gangs with rather unfortunate results. It is quite a heavy but powerful documentary.",
         "This documentary is nice if you are curious about what happened to the cast. And between the stories you can see white privilege popping up. Sadly there is no clear story line, just interviews and footage stitched together in some sort of chronology. It's just an hour, yet the producers had a hard time gathering the interviews as there is much fluff and wasted time. Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch"
