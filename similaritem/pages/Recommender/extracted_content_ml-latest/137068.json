         "A sweet movie about a religious family trying to protect their daughter from unwanted influences. However this movie is almost too sweet and too mild for anyone not raised by a fairly well-of, religious and protective family. The movie was by no means unreal, but its a movie I think very few could relate to. The acting and cinematography was pretty average, and the music reflected the American Bible-belt setting the movie takes place in, which helps set the scene and location, but is a disadvantage to the movies emotional dept, which I think this movie will seem surreal or too tame to provoke enough emotion to make this movie interesting to anyone who is not from a very religious American bible-belt family. I am from Europe, and have lived in both Bible belt America and America outside of the bible belt. The love shown by the father is touching and the issues raised here are good family value issues, presented in a good clean way for the Bible-belt Christian and for them I might rate this movie a 6 or a 7. For everyone else this movie does not hit enough debts to make it all that interesting and for them I will rate this movie a 3.",
         "I watched the movie on lifetime a few days ago. It started off interesting and had my attention right away. I guess since it was on lifetime I thought she would go crazy, someone would die, etc but I was way off. She basically hangs out with a guy that whispers when he talks(you will know it when you hear it compared how the other person is talking in the room) and supposedly that leads her to move out and hang with another guy. The movie goes from there to barely digging into what happened between the three of them and that is basically the movie. About 3/4th through of the movie I realized nothing was going to happened and it didn't. There wasn't a point to the story at all. THERE WASN'T A POINT TO THE STORY AT ALL. NOTHING HAPPENED. You would think something interesting would happened when she came back home but it really didn't. It was like a boring life story that really didn't change anything except for one thing but who didn't see that coming? And of course she and her father would say no. The movie is not worth the 6.5 rating. There is a beginning of the movie but that seems to be it. The rest is uneventful besides a few parts here and there.",
         "I honestly don't know how this is listed as a 'TV movie'. It has at least 7 uses of the f-bomb in it. The acting is substandard, it has no 'feel good' moments in it, and the production quality is severely lacking. You keep watching, thinking that there will be a point to the movie, but there never is. It just keeps dragging on and on. I honestly don't know what the writer was trying to get across to people - there is literally no plot to this movie. I truly wish that 'film makers' would think long and hard before releasing films like this one. It was nothing but a huge waste of time and money to produce. There are MUCH better movies to watch, including ones that actually have a point.",
         "I thought it had a good beginning and lead up to the daughter moving home. I got really mixed up with the \"flashbacks\" and couldn't figure out for a while just how many families or wives that the father/preacher actually had. It was at the 15 minute mark that I realized that some of the story was \"flashing back\" to why the girl left town in the first place. Trying to juggle through that for the first three quarters of the movie distracted from the point and the plot. I was watching on Lifetime network but think that the movie was meant for another media because of the \"f\" words being omitted. Again IMDb is asking for two more lines, so here I go again filling in sentences that aren't necessary because I'm finished with what I'm trying to say. How many folks don't understand their limitations on the number of lines needed to post?"
