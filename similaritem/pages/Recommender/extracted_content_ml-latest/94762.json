      "reviews": [
         "Charles Spaak is one of those French scenarists - along with Henri Jeanson, Pierre Bost and Jean Aurenche - who tended to be overshadowed by the mighty Jacques Prevert. Any writer who can list La Kermesse heroique, La Belle Equipe and La Grande Illusion on his cv - and those were just a few of his PRIOR credits, post-Ciel they include Remorques and Le Corporal Epingle - would be almost certain to land a job on 'The World Turns' were he alive today. Spaak has delivered a quiet charmer here albeit propaganda fodder for Vichy. Charles Vanel acts out of his skin as Pierre Gauthier (what, one wonders, inspired this choice of name - with its overtones of Theophile Gauthier - for the two lead protagonists) mostly by NOT acting, or not SEEMING to. He is well matched by Madeleine Renaud as Therese, his wife, who, given the somewhat thankless role of role MODEL to French women everywhere, succeeds beyond the wildest dreams of Petain in creating a flesh-and-blood PERSON. Sterling support by Ann Vandene as an amalgam of those early pioneering female pilots and Raymonde Vernay as the mother-in-law from outer Hell make this a film to cherish. It's strength lies in the accumulation of detail and the warmth of the relationships. With a less surer touch than that of Gremillon the subplot involving the daughter, a would-be musical prodigy, could be seen as over-egging the feminist pudding but here it takes its unobtrusive place in the main story of Renaud realizing her potential as a aviatrix. 8/10",
         "\"A ghost of the aviation/She was swallowed by the sky/or by the sea/like me she had a dream to fly.\" (Joni Mitchell,\"Amelia\" on the Hejira album) This beautiful movie is dedicated to daring women,who were feminist ahead of their time :Hélène Boucher,Amelia Earhardt,Maryse Bastié and a lot of those pioneers who had to fight to make their way in a chauvinist male world.Thérèse (Madeleine Renaud) fulfills her greatest dream :becoming a pilot.This is a simple but moving story. During the Occupation,the Petainist France set this movie up as an example of virtue and courage ,against the dirty Clouzot's \"le corbeau \".After the Liberation,both movies were attacked,the former,for being too petainist,the latter for showing the darkest side of the occupied country.That demonstrates the stupidity of the censorship. Today's audience will certainly favor \"le corbeau\" over \"le ciel est à vous\" :the film noir is more exciting that what I could call le film blanc.But it should appeal to women :in France too,they've come a long way.",
         "A mechanic (Charles Vanel) and his high-strung wife (Madeleine Renaud) become obsessed with aviation. Eventually, Renaud attempts to challenge the distance record for aviatrices. This film is a little too unfocused at the start - Renaud doesn't even get into a plane until the 45 minute mark. The real weakness, though, is that the two protagonists become real jerks in the middle of the film. Flight becomes an addiction, so much so that they have to hock their daughter's piano to pay for the upgrades they need to break the record. There is a little bit of a comeuppance, but not really. And absolutely none for Renaud - she certainly doesn't learn her lesson. I certainly have to imagine that her kids will grow up hating her.",
         "\"Le ciel est a vous\" offers a lot of charms - picturesque setting, eye for realistic detail, witty dialogues, good actors - but in some respects it is seriously limited by conditions under which it was made. In the first place, its nationalism is unacceptable nowadays. There's hardly any (obviously) false note in this hymn to the Little Big Frenchman/-woman. As to the scene of our heroine's chat with charmant French soldiers stationed in the desert (are they legionaries ? or legitimate occupiers ?), I'm imagining emotional responses of a recent African viewer. In fact,the general message which enthusiastically promotes Western competitiveness and expansiveness is dubious. In a touching dialogue towards the end - would it be inappropriate to call it anti-Faustian ? - husband and wife recall some genuine values which have been twisted recently by their ambitions. Unfortunately, the film does not end here. What really puzzles me, are the orphans. Am I wrong to assume that just the aerodrome deprived them of their playing ground, or did the director deliberately stain his idyll with a subversive motif ?",
         "After the German conquest of France in 1940, Hitler decided to create a 'Hollywood' style Nazi film industry to entertain the enslaved populations of Europe. ReichsMinister of Propaganda Goebbels formed & financed the Continental Film Co. of Germany, and it signed up a bunch of collaborating French actors based in the Occupied Zone in Paris where the film was produced. Vichy was mentioned in the film, but there was no film industry in the Unoccupied zone, it was just shown there. To the extent that this successful film fulfilled the aims of the Reich Ministry of Propaganda, French efforts in the film were collaboration. Or,if you wish, French efforts were Resistance in order to preserve what was left of French culture. The point of view just depended on who held the knife at your throat when the question arose."
