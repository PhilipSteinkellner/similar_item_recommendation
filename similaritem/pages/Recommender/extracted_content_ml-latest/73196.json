         "Probably not the best film directed by Mizoguchi; In fact, It has been the least appealing to me thus far. The film is deluged with tons of political arguments and commentaries on the rights of women, rights which in those times women were bereft of. Therefore, I was not as intrigued to watch the film as I have been with other films directed by him. Nevertheless, because of the engrossing and mastered filmmaking skills of Mizoguchi, this film ends up resulting in a well-worth cinematographic ride. The film is mostly accompanied by a bunch of resounding echoes of the discrimination against women in the background; it is actually the whole point the film tries so hard to remark, even though it slowly becomes completely apparent with one of the dialogues almost at the end and conclusion of the film. Throughout the film you will constantly encounter dialogues and images that demonstrate how unjustifiably and stupidly women were mistreated and underestimated. I imagine this film must have had a great impact on the audience of its time, as I believe this film is still a fresh portrayal of that matter. The camera-work is what saves this film from crumbling and becoming a tad uninteresting; it is the pillar that sustains the story. I found various scenes filled with commentaries that were not really of my interest, but because of the camera angles in which they were recreated, they kept my attention. Also, some fight scenes are superb; at one point, the camera will be moving across a roof (travelling) and you will amazingly behold a battle taking place down below. Last but not least, all there is for me to mention is that this is a riveting film, even though its topic might not be that attractive. My Score: 8.3/10",
         "Equally well-known by another metaphorical name \u2013 MY LOVE HAS BEEN BURNING \u2013 this may be a period piece but it\u2019s set in an era that was relatively recent at the time of filming, the 1880s; though a good many of Mizoguchi\u2019s works that I\u2019ve watched touched upon the political climate of their particular time-frame, this one revolves entirely around the efforts of a party (the Liberals) to push their personal agenda (promoting Women\u2019s Rights) \u2013 which, being so radical, would necessitate a change in the country\u2019s Constitution! Again, the leading role is played by Kinuyo Tanaka and based on a real person: she quarrels with her conservative parents over her support of the Liberals; however, she can\u2019t bring herself to follow her partner to Tokyo\u2026until a friend of the family is sold into slavery to pay off her father\u2019s debts! However, when she arrives in the big city and searches for her former companion, he seems changed and clearly considers her presence there intrusive; it transpires that he\u2019s sold out to the Government and is spying on the Liberals (the Election being just around the corner)! Having struck a relationship with the leader of the party, she stays on; arriving at an appointed meeting-place one day, she sees her old girlfriend being beaten up (this must surely have been quite a shockingly violent scene for its time!) and tries to intervene \u2013 the latter, in contempt and desperation, burns down the place; the Police then turn up and arrest several people \u2013 including the heroine, her new partner and the young girl. The two women share the same cell: the young girl, however, has grown bitter with the passage of time and is abrasive even to her caring older friend; still, together they endure hardship in the prison quarry \u2013 until it\u2019s discovered that the young girl is pregnant (from the man who had bought her); she loses the baby\u2026but, then, a General Amnesty of political prisoners is called and the three protagonists are re-united. With this, though, Tanaka\u2019s problems merely take a different turn: her partner is exposed as a libertine who shamelessly keeps the young girl as a concubine (a situation revealed to her by the latter\u2019s former master/lover)! Nevertheless, he\u2019s elected to Parliament; disillusioned yet undaunted in her hope of one day getting to see Japanese women attain Equality, Tanaka ultimately decides to return to her hometown (a sequence tinged with irony as the heroine overhears some people praising the humanitarian qualities of the Liberal candidate!)\u2026but, on the train, she\u2019s joined by the young girl (who, realizing she was being exploited even by those who should know better, is looking forward to a more dignified existence). While on paper all of this might seem less than appetizing (being a mix of politics and melodrama), Mizoguchi\u2019s assured handling makes all the difference \u2013 resulting in a compelling portrait of an era, highlighted by impressively-staged crowd scenes and any number of powerful individual moments depicting tension, cruelty, heartache and faith."
