         "This film is based on a well-known children's book from 1955 by Swiss author Klaus Schädelin in which the reader gets to know the world of four little rascals through the eyes of 12-year-old Eugen. Eugen and his three friends are determined to follow in mysterious Fritz Bühler's footsteps as the biggest rascals and adventurers of all times! Their quest for a long-hidden treasure and Fritz Bühler takes them from charming Berne into the mountains and to Zurich. The director has lovingly turned this well-known book into a beautiful, humorous, sweeping film full of funny little details with regard to story, effects and dialog. We kept laughing or smiling throughout the whole film. Characters, language and music are very Swiss!",
         "\"My name is Eugen\" is a kids film from 10 years ago. It is set in the 1960s and about a bunch of boys who love to do pranks and who are looking for their idol Fritzli Bühler, a famous prankster from the past. The director is Michael Steiner and he also worked on the script with a couple other guys. The film's humor is mostly based on chaos and there was one truly embarrassing scene about diarrhea and farting. No wit and no charm for most of the movie sadly. Lots of hullabaloo. Also, there are some weaknesses with the story. Sometimes they say one character is a true friend, sometimes they say they only tolerate him because he has no other friends. And yes, this contradiction already happens before he (Bäschteli) becomes a appreciated member of the gang. It's a very wild movie, but there is not much substance or relevance to it. Or anything to think or talk about. Also the unavoidable girls references weren't particularly clever or memorable. No surprise that none of the child actors have had careers since this was made and they are probably all back to normal lives now. I am truly baffled by the success this had at the Swiss Film awards back when it was released. Not recommended. There are so many other much better children's movies from recent years out there."
