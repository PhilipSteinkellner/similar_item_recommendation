            "content": "In the raucous and woefully wretched **Dirty Grandpa** director Dan Mazer's lazy and lethargic laugher gives a whole new meaning to the term \"gag comedy\" with the emphasis on the word gag. One might want to upchuck at this mindless ragtag romp that desperately tries too hard to reel in the obnoxious chuckles. Undoubtedly toothless, unimaginative, and aimlessly insipid the degenerative **Dirty Grandpa** has all the cheeky charm and hilarity as a waxy floor in an arthritic nursing home patient's dim lit room.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the questionable punchline to this foolish and crass joke-of-a-movie is why a prestigious performer of Oscar-winner Robert DeNiro's caliber doing such silly and offensive sludge as the flatulent farce **Dirty Grandpa** in the first place? Sure, DeNiro has done his share of hit-and-miss comedies in his career as well as some dramas that were lackluster and forgettable. It is true...even the great cinematic icons can gravitate to the usual duds from time to time. However, watching the intense and revered seventy-something veteran DeNiro wallow in this madcap mess is utterly inexcusable. What even possessed DeNiro to appear in such a diaper rash of a juvenile comedy? Did he lose a bet or was challenged to a dare of some awful kind?\r\n\r\nAs for DeNiro's co-star in ex-Disney Channel dreamboat star Zac Efron one can not be hardly surprised that the big screen boytoy as popped up in this train wreck of a treat seeing as though Efron's past film choices have not been what one might call consistently stellar in his film career thus far. Let's face it...**Dirty Grandpa** was begging for a tongue-lashing and rightfully so. Unless you are an uncontrollable hormonal teen with a locker room mentality attached to your blank psyche then one might find the witless **Dirty Grandpa** a bombastic bore that could not clean up its noxious act even if it ran through several durable car washes.  \r\n\r\nScreenwriter John Phillips wants to present DeNiro's crusty curmudgeon Dick Kelly as a walking wrecking ball with no filter whatsoever. In fact, DeNiro's Dick Kelly is a tragic figure that could be misunderstood by some and mistrusted by others. It appears that Dick Kelly is the cursed clown with the wounded soul--no doubt Phillips's ridiculed target for the inside satirical look at aging hardcore has-beens that rail against a world they no longer recognize and allowed to pass them by in the process. **Dirty Grandpa** could have been a dark and impish commentary on maturing quiet rage with snarling senior citizen Dick Kelly's ignorance serving as a red button for panic. Unfortunately for the throwaway **Dirty Grampa** it is not clever or calculating enough to realize its potential as a subversive chuckler while simple resting its guffaws on cheap-minded edgy banality. \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, recent widower Dick Kelly wants to unwind in the aftermath of his wife's passing and head down to Florida where he and his late beloved bride spent their treasured days near their summer home. This means enlisting the assistance of his grandson Jason (Zac Efron) to accompany him to the Sunshine State so that Dick can get loose and wild. \r\n\r\nDick, a retired military man, is not a Golden-Aged Boy Scout by any means. He is indeed a Dirty Grandpa based on his persona as a bombastic bastard of a character. Dick is a proud-minded racist, misogynist and homophobe...and these are his good qualities! Dick is indignant as he incredulously wonders why he cannot utter the N-word and does not miss a beat when drooling over the bouncy babes that could easily pass for his granddaughters. And Dick has his \"gaydar\" gander up when confronted with \"swishy guys\" in his presence. Also, there is no shame whenever Dick feels free to...um, pleasure himself regardless of whether Jason is in the vicinity or not. Dick, to say the least, is a tool in the worst way. \r\n\r\nNaturally, **Dirty Grandpa** eagerly wants to throw into the sordid mix other wacked-out characterizations to add to the clumsy raunchfest. Both Mazer and Phillips get their junk food jollies in presenting supporting players that gleefully reinforce all the staged nuttiness at hand. There is a curious slutty siren (Aubrey Plaza from TV's \"Parks and Recreation\") that wants to \"do the naughty\" with Dick to satisfy her fetish for pleasuring old geezers. And then there is Jason's galpal (Julianne Hough) that seriously needs a stick removed from her no-nonsense butt before she ties the knot. Of course this dumb display tosses a couple of collegiate cut-ups (Michael Hudson and Jake Picking) and Jason's cousin Nick (Adam Pally)--a disabled \"Dick\" wannabe.\r\n\r\nSo **Dirty Grandpa** marches to its wacky beat without realizing how much of a Grade-A stinker this insufferable session of comatose comedy this shoddy showcase really is at heart? Breezy bathroom-related humor, recycled masturbation giggles, bubbly bimbos and slap-happy drug use high-jinks--all befitting whatever odious overtones this needless and fetid funny fable managed to pull off.\r\n\r\nFor DeNiro and company **Dirty Grandpa** may have been a quick and profitable payday but for the rest of us the payoff was mere chump change.\r\n\r\n**Dirty Grandpa** (2016)\r\n\r\n1 hr. 42 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Robert DeNiro, Zac Efron, Zoey Deutch, Aubrey Plaza, Julianne Hough, Jason Mantzoukas, Jake Picking, Michael Hudson, Mo Collins, Dermot Mulrooney\r\n\r\nDirected by: Dan Mazer\r\n\r\nMPAA Rating: R\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy\r\n\r\nCritic's rating: * star (out of 4 stars)\r\n\r\n(c) Frank Ochieng",

            "content": "> The usual, nothing innovative about it!\r\n\r\nEverything I wrote was just my personal opinion, definitely not intended to offend anybody. This should have been one of the best comedies of the year, but now it belongs to one of the worst. I recommend 'Grandma' instead this which I felt a much better comedy.\r\n\r\nAt this age, Robert De Niro was unbelievably awesome, though his character needed a good support from another and that's where as usual Zac failed to deliver his part. I would have preferred someone like Taylor Lautner who's desperate for a breakthrough than the Zac who ruins always.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay was from the 'blacklist', knowing this they should have been more careful while casting for it. The story was okay, because it was not meant for one of the greatest films of all time. It was sort of a weekend getaway or the bachelor party theme, but the film gives its original reason and then those developed plots were too familiar if you have seen plenty of teen films, in the party theme.\r\n\r\nIt's supposed to make us laugh, but there are lots of outdated humours tried in the unusual route to narrate them. The grandfather-grandson combo was an excellent idea, the main plot revolves around them and it should have remained that way, but the undetermined romance was an interruption. Or they should have developed a decent romance track for a better balance in the genre.\r\n\r\nAt least it would have been all right if it was a teen film. Many of those who appeared in it were actually too old to represent the roles given to them. That's fine too, because films are fake, everything is make-up and performance, but none were at their best except De Niro and Aubrey Plaza. It is definitely a film to skip, that's my opinion, but they're a few who are defending it, so be careful that I'm not always right and they're not always wrong if you want to choose it.\r\n\r\n3/10",

      "synopsis": "Jason Kelly (Zac Efron) is at a funeral for his grandmother. He runs into his obnoxious cousin Nick (Adam Pally), who is high on drugs. Jason's grandfather Dick (Robert De Niro) requests that Jason drive him to Florida as a personal favor. Both Jason and his father David (Dermot Mulroney) don't like the idea, but Jason reluctantly agrees to help out his grieving grandpa. Jason's fiancee Meredith (Julianne Hough) is obsessively planning over their wedding and is annoyed that Jason has to leave before their upcoming rehearsal dinner. She makes him take her ugly pink car to drive Dick to Florida. Jason goes to pick Dick up from his house, only to find the man masturbating to porn in his living room. Jason is horrified. The two hit the road and stop at a diner. Jason talks about his job as a lawyer, which he makes sound boring. Dick leaves for a moment, and from a few tables down, a girl named Shadia (Zoey Deutch) spots Jason and recognizes him from a class they had. She approaches him to talk, but Jason is distracted and thinks she's a waitress there to collect the check. She takes his money and runs away with her friends Lenore (Aubrey Plaza) and Bradley (Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman), but Jason catches her before they drive away. He recognizes Shadia instantly. Dick comes out and pretends to be a college professor, which attracts Lenore, as she really wants to have sex with a professor. Dick and Lenore agree to meet up in Daytona Beach, but Jason and Shadia are against it. Jason takes Dick golfing. Dick spots two women and tries to make his move on them while pretending Jason is his disabled caddy. When Dick isn't looking, Jason tells the women how Dick isn't taking his wife's death well, prompting them to leave. Dick is upset and tells Jason that he wants to take this trip so he can have as much wild and unprotected sex as he can. Annoyed, Jason still agrees to go along with the trip. On the road to Daytona, the two encounter a psychotic drug dealer/store owner named Tan Pam (Jason Mantzoukas). Meredith calls Jason with more wedding stuff and getting frustrated that Jason isn't there to help. Once the guys hit the beach, they run into Lenore, Shadia, and Bradley, along with their two doofus friends Cody (Jake Picking) and Brah (Michael Hudson). The two of them enter a flexing competition. Jason and Dick go up to compete as well, nearly winning until Jason is worried that his antics will go viral and cost him his job. Cody and Brah win by default. Dick takes a t-shirt gun and stuffs it with a water bottle, shooting Cody in the face and breaking his nose. Jason and Dick later go to a party where Lenore and Shadia are. Jason inadvertently ends up smoking crack and doing a naked dance to \"Macarena\". Outside, Bradley is being harassed by some thugs. Dick beats the crap out of four of them before taking on the leader, Tyrone (Brandon Mychal Smith). Dick makes him apologize to Bradley. Jason wakes up nude and sunburned on the beach with a toy strapped to his crotch, and a swastika of penises drawn on his head. Meredith calls again to bother him as a child approaches Jason to touch the toy. From a distance, the boy's father thinks Jason is molesting his son and he pushes him off as the cops show up. Dick goes to bail Jason out. Jason and Dick visit Dick's old friend Stinky (Danny Glover), who lives in a retirement home. He only has a month to live and just wants to spend it there playing bingo. This makes Jason understand Dick's desire to enjoy whatever time he has left in life. Throughout the rest of their trip, Jason gets closer to Shadia, pretending to be a photographer to get closer to her. This also makes him rethink his relationship with Meredith. Dick says she isn't right for Jason and that he'll be sleepwalking through the rest of his life if he marries her. Meanwhile, Dick ends up hanging out with Lenore, plus Tyrone and his gang after they become friendly. While the group is at a karaoke bar, Cody sneaks by them and stuffs a large bag of weed in Jason's coat and looks at Dick's drivers license. After Dick goes up, Jason and Shadia sing a song together. Later, Cody reveals to Lenore and Shadia that Dick is not a professor, but a former Special Forces operative, a fact that no one in the family knew about. Cody also tells them about Jason's engagement, forcing him to tell the truth to Shadia, who is pissed at him. The cops then show up to arrest Jason for the weed. Dick bails Jason out again and admits that he took the trip not mainly for himself, but for Jason to cut loose and not be so uptight like his dad since Dick was never really there for David. Angry, Jason returns to Atlanta to proceed with the wedding. Jason goes to the rehearsal brunch with Meredith, where they sing the same song that he sang with Shadia. During the slideshow, Dick hacks the slides and puts pictures from the trip, which include Jason naked, making out with an old woman, and getting humped by a dog, along with a picture of Shadia. Jason finally tells Meredith he can't marry her, to which she responds that she slept with Nick while he was away. Jason happily leaves the brunch and runs into Dick outside, who tells him that Shadia is on a bus headed for a cruise. David follows the two and threatens to take Jason's job away from him if he bails on the engagement. David then gets tased by Pam, who joined the guys for some reason. The guys drive their truck to find the bus with Shadia. The bus driver won't pull over because the cops are following them, and he thinks that Pam narced on him on drugs that Pam sold to him. Dick then speeds up and drives toward the bus until they are both forced to stop. Jason runs out and apologizes to Shadia for lying. He decides to join her on her trip since he's now single, jobless, and possibly wanted by the cops. He goes up to her and they kiss. Dick returns home with David and apologizes to him for not being a better father. When Dick goes back to his place, he finds Lenore in there wearing his pants. She still wants to have sex with him despite him not being a professor. The two of them proceed to have sex with Dick using every old person cliche to keep Lenore excited. A little bit after the credits start, we see Jason standing next to Shadia with a baby in his hands at a baptism. The baby is Dick's new son with Lenore, and Jason and Shadia are the boy's godparents. Dick then takes the baby's thumb and uses it to poke Jason's butt.",

         "Once the credits started rolling for Dirty Grandpa, the only thing I could say was, \"Oh my god.\" It was shocking. From beginning to end the movie is shock humor, gross-out humor, crass, offensive, childish and stupid. But you know what? I laughed a lot. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't entertained throughout most of this movie. Sure, it follows a lot of road trip movie tropes and the perfunctory fight/make-up conflict near the end, but one thing about Dirty Grandpa is that it's consistent. Dirty joke after dirty joke; some of them hit, some of them miss, but they don't stop. Some of these things I never thought I'd hear come out of Robert De Niro's mouth, but the fact that it's him saying it makes it all the more funny. People will say this is a slap in the face to his legacy, but it really isn't. The Family was. Little Fockers was. This movie knows what it is - a lewd, politically incorrect road trip comedy, and it succeeds in that regard. What surprised me most about Dirty Grandpa is the chemistry between Zac Efron and Robert De Niro. They have a great comedic rapport that actually feels authentic, which helps the more insane scenes retain some semblance of realism (as thin as it may be). The rest of the cast is enjoyable too, especially Aubrey Plaza as the overtly slutty college girl who continuously surprised me with every grotesque statement uttered from her mouth. Oddly enough, De Niro feels right at home here. It's as if his character from Meet the Parents went off the deep end and decided to go on a spring break road trip with Zac Efron. Seriously, his character is ex-special forces and everything. Efron also proves once again that he's a comedic force to be reckoned with playing the straight corporate man put in awkward social situations. I don't know what people were expecting from Dirty Grandpa. Look at the title, look at the trailers. Are you really surprised? It was marketed as a gross-out comedy from day one, and guess what? It's gross. It's vile; it's degrading; it's shockingly inappropriate. Is it a good movie? Not a chance in hell. But the goal of a comedy is to make the viewer laugh, and Dirty Grandpa made me laugh. Hard. Now, if you don't like offensive humor, you should stay the hell away from this. Just know what you're getting into before seeing Dirty Grandpa and you can definitely have some fun watching it.",
         "Normally don't have patience for crude comedy but had to check it out as a Robert DeNiro fan. Definitely didn't disappoint (even with crudeness). Had plenty of laughs and plenty of insensitive crudeness to cover every area that would offend folks BUT it's advertised as this so only view if you can accept it for what it is! Maybe if viewers did a better job researching/listening to the advertisements they wouldn't be disappointed or expecting more than what's intended (sighing). Great job of acting by all and even has a moral to the story for most!",
         "Dirty Grandpa is a comedy film directed by Dan Mazer and written by John Philips. The film stars Robert De Niro, Zac Efron, Zoey Deutch and Aubrey Plaza. After Jason's grandmother dies and just before his marriage, his grandfather asks him to go on a road trip to Daytona Beach, Fla., and there's where Jason learns a couple of lessons from his \"dirty grandpa\". I found this movie really funny most of the time and I couldn't stop laughing at a lot of the jokes. I suppose that a lot of these negative reviews for this movie are from people who think that this movie is against their \"morals\". But it doesn't really matter, cause Dirty Grandpa has been a box office success and a lot of people liked it, including me. Zac Efron is really funny, he has shown that he's got comedic guts over and over again. I am becoming a fan of as I keep on seeing him in these kind of movies . Robert De Niro is also awesome on the role all throughout. I also really liked the supporting characters, especially Jason Mantzoukas as a drug dealer who had me laughing every time he was on screen. Sure this movie isn't nowhere near a comedic masterpiece and nor is it trying to be. It is a fun ride from beginning to end, and despite all the clichés, the jokes are what make this ride worth it.",
         "I usually don't feel compelled writing a review, but when reading most reviews already posted I needed to add the following: People complained about the movie being raunchy and containing too much dirty jokes, what else did you expect.. it literally has the word \"dirty\" in the title. It is not some French romantic love story, nor is it pretending to be. It is a funny road trip story filled with a lot of \"fucks\" and childish (hilarious) jokes which if you like these kind of movies will definitely keep you entertained until the end. And, ultimately it even has a small underlying message to teach you. If you are looking for something more serious, then please don't go and then complain after, maybe try checking out something else.",
         "This movie isn't actually that bad; it certainly doesn't deserve the endless line of 1-star reviews. I went to see it with very, very low expectations, after reading a negative review of it, and ended up enjoying quite a bit of it. Even from the trailer you can tell this is a silly, childish comedy with plenty of toilet and/or sexual humor. I don't know what people came to expect from it - this certainly doesn't attempt to be anything else besides that. Maybe many people aren't used to seeing De Niro in such a role, but hey, he's done other silly comedies already. Not all the jokes are that great, but it was good fun nevertheless. So, definitely childish, definitely silly, but also definitely funny in my book. I even ended up feeling for De Niro's character - hey, it's his last stand after all. So, if you don't expect much and aren't easily offended by jokes that sometimes are a bit too silly / gross /etc, you might even enjoy this!",
         "The wife and I absolutely loved this movie and can't wait for it to come out on bluray! Sure it has a crude sense of humor in it, but nowadays that is pretty common.Sure it is not Deniro's type of movie that he normally does, but I think he did a great job in playing his part. All my friends that went to see this absolutely loved the movie as well. Funny to me from the beginning to the end. Maybe a lot of the older crowd went to see this and found it too offensive or something? Not sure? I mean, it is not a movie that you want to watch with your kids, but I highly recommend this one if you are not easily offended and have a sense of humor like I do! Come on people! One star? Really? This movie was great!",
         "People really need to grow!! seriously!! I have no idea what's all the hate about. Some say it wasn't up to what they expected some say it's downright ridiculous, I mean really???? This movie is comedy, period! Get that in your thick skulls, not drama, not history, not a love story but a very cute story about a boy who hardly met his grand dad but then gets to spend the time of his life with him. in fact, he actually becomes a man after the lessons taught by his grandpa through a series of events. It's downright humour at it's best. I laughed my butt out for crying out loud! Stop throwing in ridiculous comments that make no sense and just watch the movie for the way it is. Hilarious, cute, heart warming and just memorable. I will be buying a DVD to save a copy! 10/10 without a shadow of doubt!",
         "This movie is absolutely hilarious! I didn't know much about it going in, but was so pleasantly surprised. Every actor/comedian in the film knocks it out of the park & the script is great. Sure, it's low-brow comedy, but it's very creative & compelling. Lots of next level shiznit in this one. I'm telling you the truth- I really didn't want it to end. Of course I know DeNiro, & love his work, but I didn't know how adept Zac Efron & Aubrey Plaza were at nuanced comedy. Aubrey Plaza's character; a sexy, nutty, amorous type, had me laughing out loud. Her jocular delivery was so deadpan - I honestly think she wanted to have sex with Robery DeNiro haha. Also, you gotta give Zac Efron props; the dude is fearless & will do whatever it takes to make the audience laugh. The other girl, I think the actress's name is Zoey, was hilarious & nuanced as well. Not only is she gorgeous, she holds her own with these three established movie stars. If they made a sequel, I'd be one of the first ones in line. Cheers, mates",
         "It's a real low for De Niro and Efron and I can not in my wildest dreams understand why this movie got green light... I can laugh at funny sexual jokes, but this was at a level of 5 year old's. Complete waste of money and the actor's and my time... unless the actors actually found it funny, and in that case I must admit I am a bit surprised and disappointed. Besides the large amount of bad jokes, stupid, unfunny characters, an appalling backstory and completely flat non-engaging character developments, the writing is also completely worthless. There is nothing really wrong with the actors performances, maybe even better that one would expect considering the material they had to work with. Maybe they all had a good time making the movie and getting a few laughs at work, but the result was no laughing matter, I am sorry to say.",
         "Congratulations to all the ones making this movie. It was absolutely a blast, and I laughed from start to finish. Its a new take on a old road trip/trapped in a relationship plot that works really well with the actors. Funny, raw and a bit childish humor that Robert takes to the next level. The other cast was also pretty good, from the guy who sells beach towels for 50 dollars, sunscreen for 10 dollars and METH to the controlling soon too be wife. (See the movie, and you will get the line) Every critic in the media is going to give this 1s and 2s. And that alone is a reason for us \"regular joes\" to realize this is an instant hit. I hope to see Robert and Zac doing more work in the future. As I said before. This was the funniest movie in a long time.",
         "Michael \"Beyond the Poseidon Adventure\" Caine has never been averse to starring in more than his fair share of turkeys. Talking about \"Jaws: The Revenge\" he once said \"I have never seen it, but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific!\" One can only assume that Robert De Niro has a similar attitude for getting involved in this dross. For that is what it is. Directed by Dan Mazar (\"I Give It A Year\"), its a desperate attempt at a Spring Break-style ribald comedy that misses at virtually every level. De Niro plays Dick (an appropriate name) who after a lifetime of marriage and on the day after his wife's funeral asks his grandson Jason (Zac Efron) to join him on a road-trip to Florida, with the singular aim of getting laid by a fresher a quarter his age. (You can already tell that this is all in the best possible taste). Jason - an accountant - is due to be married in the following week to the prissy and controlling Meredith (Julianne Hough), against Dick's wishes. Needless to say with this paper-thin plot, (and given that America is obviously such a small place) he runs into an old (and naturally sexy and gorgeous) school friend Shadia (Zoey Deutch). With Dick applying a 'certain set of skills' from his previous work (hasn't this plot been worked before in a De Niro comedy?) he wreaks maximum havoc in Daytona Beach in trying to lead Jason astray. Will he succumb and find true love rather than fall into a marriage of boring expectation. What's there to like in this film? Well, there is some almost amusing sexual banter between de Niro and the nympho-like Lenore (Aubrey Plaza, and probably the best thing in the film). The great Danny Glover has a short cameo. The music used is well chosen(although the music editing seems extraordinarily inept). And if you are female (or male but gay) then the extended scenes of Efron's almost naked body might do something for you. But on the flip side, there are few groups that this film won't manage to offend. About 75% of the script is the F-word. It portrays extensive and casual hard-drug use. The film is offensive to gay people. Offensive to deaf people. Offensive to cancer patients. Offensive to black people. And deeply offensive to lovers of cinema. I have used enough words on this trash. Those UK readers who are old enough to remember the older style of film classification will remember that there was an 'A' rating. I would bring it back for this film, the 'A' standing for \"Avoid\". In fact, it was so offensive, the rating should be 'AA' for \"Absolutely Avoid\". I have a monthly cinema card, so I got to see this film for 'free'. I was significantly overcharged. (Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review. Thanks.)",
         "Not much worse to a film fan than shelling out $12 dollars to go see a decent actor waste his skills on low information trash like this. I know that the same class of stoners who think Adam Sandler's latest outing in The Ridiculous 6 is funny will also find this disgusting waste of screen time funny. I for one do not and as I write this I long for IMDb to do the right thing and enable a zero rating for movies as that is the true first number and this is another in a long series of Hollywood efforts that deserves that true first number the zero. To say that Robert De Niro has sunk to this low in cinema just to increase his bank account by what ever amount they paid him is a shame, as he certainly could not have taken on this schlock in order to increase his range of acting expression. He could have simply hit his thumb with a hammer and the resulting dialog would not have been any worse, perhaps it would have been better. As he did not do so we will never know.",
         "This movie is so good I was laughing so hard. You might think it is just like any other American comedy movie. Well, it might be, but it is really unexpected. At least to me. I've never seen Robert Deniro playing that role. I think its just hilarious. I was laughing from the very beginning of the movie. I totally recommend it to everybody. I have to say I'm not a huge fan of Zac Efron, but he did good here, I always see him as the High School Musical Star. He is been doing good stuff lately. Best movie for a Friday Night. I think I'm going to watch it again right now, lol PS I don't know why I have to write at least 10 lines to be able to post a review. This is just meant to say what you think about the movie, not to write a novel about it. I guess I have just a few words left to write. Watch it, you won't regret it",
         "When I heard Dirty Grandpa I thought something similar to Bad Grandpa. I was not prepared for what I was about to witness. Robert De Niro's character was the complete opposite from the work we've seen from him before. He changes from the over protected parent in \"Meet the Parents\" to the wild old man without a filter. To younger viewers this movie might be exactly what they are looking for to get a good laugh.But to the more conservative viewers this movie might be too obscene due to the curse words and lewd remarks De Niro makes throughout the movie .On the other hand I found this movie entertaining,I like that De Niro took a step away from his normal roles and played something more risky. It was a shock but I enjoyed his performance.He perfectly depicted a dirty grandpa.",
         "Well, I won't ever get that hour and 45 minutes back of my life. Dirty Grandpa is the worst film so far of 2016 that I have seen and will likely end up in the bottom few films on my list for the entire year. Robert De Niro has done disservice yet again to an illustrious career in film, but I can't even call this piece of trash a film. It's poorly written and horribly offensive. I'll keep it short because there's no need to waste more time of my life thinking about this garbage film. The film stars De Niro and Zac Efron who play the grandpa and grandson respectively. Sadly the promising aspects the trailers had of them having a fun and raunchy dynamic are overpowered by insensitive jokes and incredibly stupid gags. There's every type of silly and lazy humor including overdone sex jokes, poop humor, clichéd dick jokes, and yes even fart humor that is horribly misplaced. I don't think I've ever see a film take aim at everyone from gay and lesbians to people with disabilities so insensitively. It's not even like its playful humor that can work within a story, its small one liners that feel completely forced and raise the hair on your skin for the wrong reasons. There is a scene in which Efron's character sings karaoke and of course I immediately thought of High School Musical series. I would have rather watched any of those 3 films four times in a row before watching another scene from Dirty Grandpa. Yes, it's that bad. Aside from all that, there is but one redeemable thing from this movie, that being Aubrey Plaza. Her strange and yes very awkward dynamic with De Niro, who is set on having sex with her, can be at times funny. But nothing from this film will make anyone laugh out loud. The plot is a jumbled mess that does nothing to further its characters or story. I can go on and on but the point being, don't go see this film. It's a waste of just under 2 hours which felt about 2 hours long. +Plaza...I guess? -Offensive humor -Why are there fart jokes? -Writing is all over the place -Unbearably awful 1.5/10",
         "I am not a big fan of DeNiro, but still the fame of the overall casting together with the 6 IMDb ranking, convinced me that I should check this out. Unfortunately this was the worst idea of this year. In order to save my Saturday night I had to ran away of this after huge effort staying for halfway through. I'm 42 and far from being a puritan, but such movies are American cinema's decadence. Comedy is the most difficult genre. It is easy to write and make a drama, but what is difficult is to make a real comedy with real humor. Only English and a bit the French are still able to do this. American comedy has become a compilation of disgusting things including drugs and sexual fluids innuendos and raw images that could make you throw up. I'm sorry but seeing a 73y.o. person masturbating, even if he is the greatest actor of all time, or innuendos of pedophilia cannot make me laugh. Even if you can tolerate such jokes still the plot, characters and development is as dumb and shallow as it can be. An insult to the audience and to the cinematic art. I wish there could be negative stars to give 10.",
         "'I haven't had sex in 15 years and I wanna f*ck! f*ck! f*ck! f*ck!' 'Oh, so that's what this is all about??' Yes this is what this movie is all about, Robert De Niro's dirty grandpa character who has just lost his wife of 40 years, is now revealed to be a foul mouthed, booze obsessed pervert who wants to f*ck young girls. Its up to the young, clean cut and unaware Jason (Efron) to escort him from Georgia to his Florida retirement home. Aaand that's your movie in a nutshell people, sound familiar? Well that's probably because its been done a sh*tzillion times before. I mean honesty, who thought of this? who green-lit it? The entire concept is so cliché and dated, an old grandfather figure that turns out to be a dirty, loud mouthed, profanity spewing perv who also just happens to be an ex-special forces type so he can also kick ass if needs be. This of course means you're gonna get a sequence where he does indeed kick someone's ass much to the surprise of Jason his grandson. Naturally of course, the fact that grandpa is an ass- kicking, alcohol machine, means that the grandson character must be a total goodie goodie, a real preppy nerd type because its the perfect equal polar opposite match-up. Completely and utterly predictable, clichéd, corny and unoriginal, the characters literally lay out the ground plan for the plot without even having to write a single word of dialog for them. And yes you've guessed it, that plot simply revolves around lots and lots and lots of binge drinking at parties, girls in skimpy bikinis, pool parties, beach parties, drinking, drugs, lame pranks, drinking, sex, nudity, drinking, jail time, muscle flexing and plenty of drinking. This is basically the modern frat boy flick minus any originality because frat boy flicks were a staple diet back in the 80's. So this odd pairing drive off on this road trip of sorts in an attempt to reach Florida. God knows how far they actually get because the entire flick is taken up with the duo getting into various parties so grandpa can try and get laid. This is against the wishes of a shocked Jason of course but he usually ends up getting tricked or drugged into it, then winds up enjoying it, then winds up waking up somewhere hungover and naked...or in jail, take your pick. The whole time Jason is also trying to hide all this outrageous behaviour from his very sexy, yet very prudish fiancée and his conservative parents. Anyway all I know is at one point they get to Daytona beach in Florida, no clue how they got there or how far they still had to go, but who cares. Now in all honesty the casting for grandpa Dick with De Niro is pretty good. De Niro is the obviously the perfect age and he has that perfect persona where you're not really sure what he's actually like, he could easily be a dark horse. To that extent De Niro does the job well, as we know he's great at swearing and being tough, he still looks pretty tough, and he fits the rough ex-services persona well also. For all intense and purposes he could easily be playing yet another mobster type in a comedy, he never really swings too far from that schtick. As for Jason played by Efron, well to be honest the guy is too good looking and too muscular for this part. He isn't too bad with his comic timing and everything (surprisingly!), but when it came to sequences like the 'flex-off' on the beach and when he's generally topless, he's way too ripped! That's not a bad thing but I really think to get the right comedic affect they should of cast someone without a good physique, with bad hair, someone who's a bit geeky looking. That would at least be a good opposite to the rest of beach/party going extras who are generally all sexy boys and girls. The fact that Efron is way hotter than all of them kinda makes most of the sexual innuendo gags fall flat. I must point out one character played by some bloke called Jason Mantzoukas. Oh my f*cking God this guy was so f*cking annoying I could of killed him, literally killed him. Who is this guy? Where did he come from? Why is he being cast in movies? Is he supposed to be a funny guy? Holy sh*tstains this guy was dreadful, completely unfunny, everything just fell flat or totally missed the target by miles. His whole drug obsession spiel was just so f*cking clichéd, so old, so not funny! Yeah its so cool and amusing to do drugs or pretend to do drugs ha-ha-ha! Jesus Christ I was giggling at sh*t like this when I was a kid back in the mid 80's. Then you have the two corrupt cops, one male and one female, played by whoever, I don't care. Once again, completely not funny, not even close, just cringeworthy on every level, literally amateurish. Yeah so bottom line, this is a piece of sh*t, an unfunny piece of modern day movie garbage. Not even De Niro or Efron's perfectly tanned torso can save this, its dribble of epic proportions with not a laugh in sight. That is of course...the thought of seeing De Niro's cock in Efron's face sounds good to you? Or 72 year old De Niro's character having sex with a supposed 20 something college student (Lenore) and then having a kid together (making Efron's character the uncle to his grandfathers newborn son and a college slut his new grandmother). Oh and then there's the real classy dialog between grandpa Dick and Lenore...'You're gonna tsunami on my face', 'You're gonna flood like the Nile', Nice. 2/10",
         "I'm going to go out on a limb and assume a lot of the people who gave this poor reviews were expecting a more serious De Niro like his prior roles and this movie is the complete opposite. I almost peed my pants I laughed so hard. The humor is crude and not politically correct but personally, I don't watch comedies for their political correctness, I watch them to laugh. I thought the acting was great too, it was believable to say the least. I'm still kind of perplexed about the awful reviews but to each his own I guess. I would totally recommend this movie if dirty jokes and foul language don't bother you. Don't let the other reviews scare you.",
         "It's not uncommon for Hollywood's A-list stars like to be handed to highly questionable projects, films that leave you asking \"why?\". Robert De Niro definitely gives off an unusual (and brutally raucous) vibe here in arguably his goofiest role of his career, partially since he is not known for raunchy R-rated comedies and has spent most of his careers spawning in roles of serious subject matter. Zac Efron on the other hand, is no stranger to the hardcore comedy territory, such as playing a college fraternity leader in 'Neighbors'. These two actors collaborate for the first time in this raucous comedy directed by Dan Mazer, a film that's not terrible but certainly what labels a low point in their career. Zac Efron plays Jason Kelly, a high-strung lawyer in his way to marrying his boss's uptight daughter Meredith (played by Julianne Hough). With his wedding only days ahead, Jasok is asked to drive his widowed, loathsome grandfather Dick (played by Robert De Niro) from his house to Boca Baton, Louisiana. Along the way, they run into college friends Lenore (played by Aubrey Plaza), Bradley (played by Jeffrey Bowyer Chapman), and Shaudia (played by Zoey Deutch), and what was supposed to be an easy cross-state trip results in an odyssey of drugs, booze, and embarrassing mayhem while grandfather Dick go outs in search for a new love of his life. It's easy say Zac Efron and Robert De Niro do make quite an odd comedic duo at first glance. But the real question is do they make a successful duo here. To some extent, sort of. But it definitely isn't one that works as well as it should have. The two leads both have heir hilarious moments every once a while but a lot of time, they try way too hard and it's not always funny. Efrom and De Niro spend nearly the entire length spitting out raunchy dialogue ranging from sex jokes, genitalia jokes, masturbation jokes along with explicitly crude gags that often come off but forced though occasionally funny. Of course based on the title, the level of vulgarity shouldn't come to too much of a shock, except maybe the fact that De Niro indulges so far into the level and seems to have fun dropping a large horde of penis jokes. Possibly the most questionable element here maybe De Niro's flirtatious interaction with Aubrey Plaza who plays a college girl probably only a third of his age. The aspect may be funny but tends to be conceived as rather than off-putting than sexy, especially considering the fact there is a brief sex scene between the two (no nudity involved). In the end, the hilarity isn't particularly strong but could been enough to semi- distract viewers from the blatantly rushed storyline, but only if you watching Zac Efron get high on cocaine or De Niro drinking booze with college girls in bikinis. Dirty Grandpa marks a rather low point for the careers for both Zac Efron and Robert De Niro but definitely isn't what I consider one of the worst movies of this year so far. After all, it does succeed at least bringing some laughs. However, the effort of the two leads do not always prevail. For comedy fans, this film may be worth a try, but definitely won't please everyone, especially those who are looking for Robert De Niro in a more solid comedic form.",
         "Have you ever noticed that often when we are on the road driving to somewhere, suddenly there's 2-door convertible Porsche whizzed by on either side of your 10-year old clunky Corolla, you looked up and you always found the driver of that $100thousand++ sport car was a gray haired or baldy old gizzard. That scene always made you think: Why so many old farts driving these kind fast cars? After you looked in the mirror and did some deep soul search, you'd suddenly realize that time is the essence of forcing you to do something more extravaganza before it's too late. Everybody wants to go to heaven/paradise(*if there's one), but better late than sooner; and before the curtain calls you to kick the bucket, better drive a dream car before DMV requesting you to do a eyesight test. De Niro, I think also got this before-its-too-late urgent syndrome. Like some of the other old Hollywood gizzards, Christopher Plummer, Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Diane Keaton, Michael Cann... he would respond and accept any cast thrown his way, cashing in his old fame is the only way to add up more zeros in his bank account. But there's a negative drawback: most of these films he signed on were not serious enough movies but so-called \"Comedy\", the genre that has been messed up with \"Farce\"(or, Farmedy?). By doing so many clown-like characters in so many farces, now his facial expressions and his acting were limited only to his face: his mouth and his wrinkles acting formula, and nothing else. Almost in all of his recent years' movies, he just repeatedly used his ugly and uglier old facial expressions to waltz through all of these formulaic miserable farces, the only improved difference is that mole on his face. Making more money as he still could, to hell with the screenplay, the scenario, the plot...since farce does need or require his once great performing art, all he has to do is his squeezed facial expressions, dirty words in the dialog are the easier part. Want me to play a role in your farce? Money first, no refund, if the movie turned out to be a bummer. Once you decided to become a beggar, you just couldn't be a picky chooser. My God, look at his facial expressions in every movie, they were all the same.",
         "Don't let the political correctness douche kits who find inspirational quotes on the back of period pads tell you this movie is bad. This movie is highly inappropriate and hilarious. De Niro is legend and no this movie doesn't change that, if anything, adds to the man's portfolio of amazing talent. If you don't take life too seriously and can laugh at some stupid, yet clever and funny, stuff, give it a watch. Not the biggest Zac fan, but hell, even he played his role great. Reading through reviews I think a lot of people are in crappy jobs they don't want and never chased that younger dream. Watch this great comedy and you'll know what I mean. Make the most of it before they ban swearing in adult comedy...",
         "A very successful comedy, that made me laugh out loud, as I have not laughed in a long film. Robert De Niro and Zac Efron plays flawlessly, you have nothing to reproach them, comical phases are a lot, not the kind of comedy with just a few scenes, but one that hearty laugh, I can say that is worth seeing. But now depends on the type of humor that we each agree, this movie has many moments and perverse aftershocks, people who do not have liked movies like American Pie, do not recommend this film because it is similar. Otherwise the film worth seeing. By far the best comedy seen in the last many, many years! I recommend !! I love De Niro and gives earned the right to play and-not that kind of film that you see it's OK, if not, it's not a loss, but I think it was a lot of fun. So if you want to relax and not beat your head ... deserves.",
         "This is the first time I walked out of the theater within 15 minutes after the movie started. We went to see it because of Robert De Niro because I really liked him in The Intern. In that movie he was a decent gentleman with nice taste and style. However this time he let me down big time! He totally ruined his good image by taking part in this horrible movie. The language was so rude in this movie. You hear the F word and the S word literally Every two seconds. Is that even necessary?! I understand people curse when they're really mad, but I really hate it When they talk like that Every freaking minute in Every freaking sentence. If the movie makers think that's funny or cool, I'm gonna tell them they're wrong! That's the reason why there was nobody in the theater for this movie when we walked in, because people simply just don't like this! I wanted to see what happened next, but I just couldn't stand the language. If I had a pair of ear plugs I might consider staying more.",
         "I really REALLY didn't want to like this film. I was coxed into watching it with a friend, I read the summary prior to watching and the whole story line seemed outrageous and totally not my thing but I went along with it anyway. Now whilst the story line certainly is outrageous i found myself laughing start to finish - its certainly NSFW and i wouldn't want to watch it with any of my relatives as it was quite crude in places, but if you take it for what it is, it's hilarious. 100% would happily watch again.",
         "Dan Mazer, the director behind a lot of Ali G and I Give It A Year, also writes a lot, most recently Office Christmas Party and Bridget Jones's Baby with Brüno and Borat in his writing credits too, however, Mazer directs a story written by someone else, a fairly unknown John Phillips. Zac Efron plays the straight-laced lawyer boy, Jason Kelly who reluctantly agrees to drive his recently widower Grandfather to Florida, too soon. before his wedding. Robert De Niro slips comfortably into comedy mode and becomes this lecherous dirty old man on a mission to get himself laid, and possibly his grandson on the way. De Niro is stand-alone brilliant and steals the entire film. He's the Grandpa you're so ashamedly proud of, justifying his disgusting behaviour and attitude as he verbally slaps people in the face, sometimes physically. It's a role I can no longer see someone else do. He is the dirty Grandpa. What ensues is a totally wacky and hilarious road trip, not totally unbelievable, but way up there with silly over-the-top comical situations. Efron looks like he's been set up and pranked upon constantly, by his own Gramps who has quite a few tricks up his sleeve and possibly some state secrets too. The script is loaded with clever put-downs, mostly delivered by De Niro, with a heavy does of sarcasm. Plenty of awkward situations, and inappropriate embarrassments but without going to the extremes like some of the comedies released this year. It's just silly and the plot holes are quickly ignored due to the hilarities. Zoey Deutch and Aubrey Piaz pretty much make up the rest of the supporting cast, and the targets for De Niro, causing a major distraction for Efron who's soon to be married and cannot forget with the needy, dominating wife-to-be constantly calling for colour schemes, rehearsal arrangements and press releases. It's predictable but that doesn't ruin the film, it's like you already know the story and how it's going to pan out but it's then remixed comedy style which makes it forgivable. It doesn't pretend to be anything but a funny comedy. I've said before, all good comedies need good soundtracks, and this one is a great example of that, making full use of a suitable mixture to create the perfect atmosphere. It's proper laugh out loud funny, especially Jason Mantzoukas' Classic Pam. I suppose it's comedy I can kind of relate to, reminding me of my pals. It's a road trip with pals that's on always on form. Non-stop heckles, and pranks come-backs. Running Time: 8 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 8 Story: 7 Script: 8 Creativity: 7 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 just for Classic Pam. Would I buy the Bluray?: Yes 79% 8/10"
