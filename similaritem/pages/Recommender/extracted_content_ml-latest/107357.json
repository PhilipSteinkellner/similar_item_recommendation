         "Sensitive and very well done. All of the brain disorders were clearly defined. Bi Polar, schizophrenia, depression, PTSD, and how these families cope and are emotionally affected. This series of movies gives the patients and families hope. I wish they would also deal with Borderline Personality albeit extremely difficult to diagnose. It is obvious by the quality of the actors that these are issues that we all can hope to deal with effectively. Congrats for shedding light on such sensitive issues.",
         "This is the first time I have seen a film realistically depict what a mentally ill person's life is like and how it effects others through the interactions of normal daily living. I place primary significance on this in that it is of great value in promoting awareness of mental illness in society today. As with much that has social stigma attached, learning about the basics eases the path to enlightenment. Mental illnesses touch all of our lives in some way and so much burden can be eased by replacing bias with understanding. I applaud this film for keeping it simple enough that you may from time to time question what is crazy.",
         "I caught this movie on Lifetime recently and started watching it since I work in social services. The vignette on Schizophrenia was hard to swallow and seemed unrealistic. Not to say that a person with Schizophrenia can't recover or have less symptoms, but I think the movie could've shown a better or more realistic image of schizophrenia if they were going to bother to put it in the film. The average onset age of Schizophrenia in women is 25 and Brittney Snow's character discusses being a teenager with Schizophrenia. Despite this, the movie also focuses on depression, PTSD and bipolar disorder in a more realistic manner. Mental illness still has such a negative stigma, it is great to see a movie try to shed some light on what a person with mental illness' life is like. Hopefully those who watch it can feel some empathy for the main characters and their families.",
         "I thought the portrayals of the differing mental illnesses in this film to be really accurate. Another reviewer had mentioned that the portrayal of Schizophrenia was a bit inaccurate, and not common and this I would agree with. However, it did show something that does happen even if not often. I would like to personally thank all of the people who had a part in making this film. I suffer from mental illness and am very grateful for this film and anything else that promotes awareness. I would also like to add that if anyone involved in making this film sees this post, I would love to see a second film of the same nature made. Perhaps it could include, GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), PD (Panic Disorder), Agoraphobia, and Dissociative Identity Disorder. I suffer from GAD with PD, and Depression. I would have loved to have seen a character with GAD/PD. Just a thought for another production. Sincerely, Randy Cooper",
         "After I saw the film Five directed by Jennifer Aniston, Patty Jenkins and 3 more credits this was my second film which was a compilation of five separate short stories although part 1 , 3 and 5 was related. In each part of these five a psychological disease was depicted meticulously and beautifully hence we could see the pain and suffering that other members of family bear in order to cope with their patients. The storyline was great as I personally believe that having insight to your mental problem is the first step to take in treatment.Some how the movies was inspiring as we saw a schizophrenic young girl(Brittany Snow)not only managed to finish her law lessons but also tried to help people suffering from mental disorders such as a young mother with PTSD of war(Jennifer Hudson). At the end I recommend the movie to those who are interested in or curious about psychology.",
         "The movie consists of 5 stories, the first, third and fifth one are coherent, the other two only contain the same message. I wouldn't say the movie was bad, because it was interesting for me, but it is definitely not a mainstream movie. The acting was good, especially Brittany Snow's and the movie is built up properly, though it has several issues which I do not really want to point out, you will see them. For me for example the second one wasn't really interesting and neither realistic. I only recommend it to you if you have a relative who has mental disorder or if you are interested in the topic. (for example learning about it at university)"
