         "I saw this documentary for the first time this evening on TCM. I was not disappointed. I found Leslie Caron very open in discussing both her public and private life with great honesty. Throughout these many decades I have seen Gigi so many times I know the dialogue and music very well. If one has followed Ms. Caron's career I would highly recommend viewing this short film the next time TCM is able to showcase her work. You won't be disappointed.",
         "One of my favorite movies is an \"American in Paris\" with Gene Kelly and of course I have been that American as a soldier that visited the Eiffel Tower city of light and love five times including my honeymoon! And so when watched La Maestra Caron's movie The Reluctant Star it makes me feel that now I have that in common with Leslie, my love for her France and for Paris though I now know she calls Great Britain home! I really liked The Reluctant star and how she has overcome so much in her life from surviving WWII in Europe to her worldwide fame as a both a star in the states and all over the world! avenir heureux Leslie!!!"
