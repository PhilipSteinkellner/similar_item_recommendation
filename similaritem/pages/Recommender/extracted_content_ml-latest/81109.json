         "In his first attempt at a colour film, director Frantisek Vlácil transports us by means of a train journey to Czechoslovakia where we are met with the repercussions of World War Two. A love tale with peril written all over it; Komer exemplifies the misfortunes which war carries to the table and how in its attempt to reconstruct minor faults of the world, war can end up hindering and reproducing them further. But will the two unlikely protagonists beat the odds in an unhopeful world with a happy ever after? In Adelheid, the well selected cast and Vlácil's fine directing skills have the ability to make the audience experience the same emotions they do - we feel the loneliness, the bouts of happiness and the relevant sensations at the end. A fine piece of cinema, especially for its time, and one which truly represents casualties of war. VMF",
         "Spoilers alert! As the camera moves in and out of train tunnels, stuck sometimes in the darkness, this film examines the post-war, built-in prejudices that remain in a war's aftermath, and how such intolerant views prevent any society from advancing very far in the reconstruction stage. A young Czech Lieutenant returns from the war, weakened and still mentally and physically damaged, but is allowed to recover in a giant mansion that was the property of a wealthy German war criminal during the war, and discovers the young German maid that is allowed out of the camps each day to help is actually the daughter, Adelheid, of that former Nazi resident. In a near wordless exchange, he finds himself enamored by her even though she is really his servant and has little choice under the circumstances, but he allows her to stay and tries to build her trust and affection. But the ever watchful eyes of the police are more interested in hanging her father and tracking down her still missing brother, seeing Germans as little more than dogs. Love is simply out of the question. So, in a rather extended sequence, all appear to be losers in this little Bohemian village, and our lieutenant is seen at the end walking in the snow past a gravestone that was seen in the opening, marked, `This is the end of the road.' Further on lie minefields; so he walks further on, in a blanket of white snow.",
         "I saw this three years ago at a festival and I still recall it vividly. The film really lingers. Yes, it's about trust - and it's also about remembering and forgetting. The film really focusses on the dichotomy between \"evidence\" and what it represents. Evidence is seen to fall drastically short of the \"truth\" - which for Vlacil is something intangible but communicable by film.",
         "ADELHEID is one of the very few films dealing with the largely forgotten brutal expulsion of the ethnic (Sudeten) German from Bohemia and Moravia in the aftermath WWII. It is even more remarkable as it was in Czechoslovakia in 1970, when this was still a dark taboo chapter in the country's history (only in the last two decades a change has occurred). The expulsion (\"Odsun\") of up to 3 Million people was accompanied by terrible massacres of civilians, whose perpetrators have been covered by the state afterwards through general amnesties. Generally regarded within Czech society as an eye-for-an-eye consequence and just punishment for Hitler's occupation, ADELHEID was the first (and for decades only) film to question such a view and to criticize post-WWII treatment of the Germans by the Czechs or even present the subject. Directed by the brilliant Frantisek Vlacil (MARKETA LAZAROVA), the film has a meditative, poetic atmosphere and a few non-realistic elements: the expelled Germans dressed in black at the beginning of the film appear like ghosts in the mist, the house of the Nazi party official, where most of the action takes place, is rather presented like some mythical ogre's home from some ancient fairy tale."
