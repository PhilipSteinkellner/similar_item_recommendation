         "This was a really funny movie. I have never seen so much sexual humor in an Indian movie before. It was a funny surprise. Everyone gave an awesome performance except for Ritesh Deshmukh. What was he doing in this starcast? He lacked any expressions whatsoever, and his acting was not convincing of all. My favorite was Aftab--he was hilarious! Lara, Vivek, Ajay, and the wives were great. The dialogues and the story was terrific, even if it got just a little serious in the second half. You can tell that the cast had great chemistry. Songs were good. \"On the Roof, in the Rain\" was the best with the title song as a close runner-up. It was nice how the songs maintained the light atmosphere of the movie.",
         "Yet again we have three principal characters around whom the whole movie revolves. Isn't that a bit too much inspiration since Dil Chahta Hain? Anyways, the movie justifies each of them nevertheless. Without giving away too much about the plot, its three guys who decide to have extra-marital affair and land into trouble. And then its hilarious cat-and-mouse game with cops (ie. Ajay Devgan). Noteworthy are the wives of our heros who have distinct character one of them being extremely religious, one being dominative and one being possessive (\"You miss me, na?\" - Amrita Rao stands out!). What makes this movie click? Well, the one-liners, sexual innuendos, comedy scenes, properly placed songs and the stern Police Officer. The director was crystal-clear of the product he wanted to deliver - a fun filled sexual comedy, and has added each bit that seamlessly integrates with the main storyline. And he has been successful, I must admit.",
         "Masti � a movie that surpassed all my expectations and went on to become one of my most enjoyed movies this year. Going in to watch this movie I had all the reservations � no actors that I really did like; a director that I had written off since his Ishq days; songs that I had not heard of; and the expectation that bollywood cannot do comedy humour for the British audience. How wrong was I going to be proven!!! The comedy was spot on as were the apparent and intended lines and joke � this movie seriously did take the comedy to a crude new level not seen in bollywood. One would have to say that this movie did indeed take one step further for bollywood as American Pie did for Hollywood. The songs certainly did grow on me, especially the 'seyya ji' item number � the others are just as tappy (except the 'one the roof' � well all can't be perfect!!!). The next surprise was that this great movie was from none other than Indra Kumar � someone I had written off since his movie ISHQ over a decade ago. The director had to be good, talented and experienced to have this great comedic timing as well as being able to juggle all the actors. Finally, the actors were good and have to say that I am beginnings to like Vivek and certainly beginning to adore Amrita Rao � this girl is hot and one to watch out for. Having seen this movie I will have to say that I will defiantly be open to the idea that bollywood can do comedy, but will be more excited about Indra Kumars next venture. One movie that I will certainly recommend that you watch, and if you have already watched it I will recommend that you go and watch it again.",
         "Masti is one of the most enjoyable Indian comedies released since 'Dil Chatah Hai', and is a must see for Bollywood movie goers who enjoy comedies and are open minded. The start of the movie is superb, with effortless acting and great comic timing shown by the main actors; the first 1/3 of the movie deserves a 10/10. Later however, the film tries to take itself too seriously and fails in some respects; Ajay Devgan showed dry acting for a very dry role, 'I hate crime, and i hate criminals'; please... However the dialog remains enjoyable throughout, and the ending seems to tie things up well. The songs are also fun and stay within the plot of the film; i.e. no flying off to different locations around the world changing clothes every few lines. As for the girls, Amrita Rao is the Queen of Cute; both she and Lara seem to be the only girls with acting and dancing abilities. However the rest may something to be desired in different departments. All round, this movie is packed full of laughs and Masti, which all make up for the lack of plot, and thus Masti is a must see if you enjoy a good laugh.",
         "Let me start with what a number of reviewers have said already. Masti took Bollywood sexual comedy to a new level. It was a pioneer in foraying into subjects which Hindi movies were really afraid to venture into. There are lots and lots of double-meaning jokes. Another movie which released later and took a similar initiative was \"Kya Kool Hain Hum\". Three friends, having gotten frustrated by their mundane marriage lives and badgering wives decide to go in the search of women for extra- marital affairs and meet after a month to compare notes. Their misjudgement hurls them onto the path of blackmail, murder and mental torment; where in the end they realize that \"ghar ki daal\" (home cooked curry) is better than \"bahar ki biryani\" (out-cooked chicken rice). As for the movie itself, if judged overall, yes - it has a lot of plot holes; yes - the basic premise is far fetched; yes - it can be termed as LGBT-phobic by modern audience, especially if the audience in question is western; and not to mention the sometimes over-the-top and not-so- subtle acting. But it really really works for you if viewed in the context of India in 2004. I was smiling half the movie and a lot of scenes had me in splits. The acting majorly rests on the shoulders of the three leads who have done their job admirably well. They appeared at real ease in most of the scenes and were energetic with the body language and facial expressions. Vivek Oberoi, as a reformed playboy married to a clingy wife, is the unofficial lead of the leads and is a bit constrained than his sidekicks which the usually the case. Ritiesh Deshmukh, as the clueless dentist is awesome in parts especially in the fight scene with his Mother-in-law. But the intermittent visions he has with a fluttering eyelid kind of annoyed me. But, the man who takes the cake and is treat to watch in every scene is undoubtedly Aftab Shivdasani. You can predict each and every expression he is going to have, but still laugh at his antics. The writers could have come up with something better than the \"Lele\" story line to use his abilities. Ajay Devgan has a one dimensional role and does a one dimensional job. Among the wives, Amrita \"the satellite\" Rao is the only one who can really act. The other two girls have to improve on a lot of things. Lara Dutta is sensual, but perhaps a little bit tame, as a seductress. They nailed it with the music. \"Dil de diya hain\" is the song of 2004 for me. All-in-all a fun fare for sure. If you want a 2.5 hour laugh ride to escape a bad day, go for it! In case you are not comfortable with Hindi, make sure you have good subtitles, because a lot of jokes are cultural and slang-based.",
         "Indra Kumar known for dramatic films mixed with over the top comedy(mostly in first half)e.g. DIL, BETA, ISHQ, AASHIQ tried to make a complete comedy on the lines of American PIE The film is about adultery, sex treated in a funny way and the jokes are very funny at times especially the problems depicting their marriage and the decision of affair is also treated well The whole angle makes you laugh at times though illogical but you shouldn't ask questions The tempo looses till Lara reveals the plan and then the twist in the tale The Ajay track is very well handled The entire track of Ajay-Viveik- Aftab- Ritiesh is hilarious but some gags are treated badly one is the overdose of the gay jokes which is funny at first and then done to death Also the Rakhi Sawant portion Plus the melodrama towards the finale The climax too isn't that great Direction by Indra Kumar is good in most parts Music is okay Amongst actors Aftab Shivdasani sharpens his comic skills though he is too loud at places but he does a great job in most places Ritiesh steals the show with his brilliant performance He looks the character and plays it with brilliance, his expressions only make you laugh mostly, He is natural Viveik tries a bit hard and does well in some portions but looks out of place in some Lara Dutta is good Ajay Devgan fits his part very well and deadpan humour suits him well Amongst wives Genelia is very good, Amrita does her part well though she is too much at times Tara Sharma bores Archana is hilarious",
         "Aftab Shivdasanis epic dialog from this film is this one lets have an affair guys. starting Vivek Oberoi,Ritesh Deskhmukh & Aftab Shivdasani Masti 2004 is about 3 guys who used to have all the fun until they get married & their wives are real suspicious creature,to evade this boring life they make a plan to have some fun by cheating on their wives and having affair with girls,but soon their plan goes down drain as they are involved in crimes plus a die hard criminal hater cop is looking for them. the cast was really good Ajay Devgan was as usual,Tara Sharma and Aftab Shivdasani steals the show with their hilarious dialog's,Ritesh was OK and Vivek Oberoi really impressed me here he is such a great actor,Amrita Rao plays a cute suspicious wife whom Vivek's character refers to as Sattalite,the writing of this film is so rich,i mean they didn't try it hard to make it vulgar and all that it was just a situational comedy with sexual jokes that worked in 2004 for Indian audience & abroad,there are a lot of dialog's & scenes that made me laugh specially Aftabs milk scene it was pure hilarious,Lara Dutta comes with her regular sexy Style only thing bad is Genelia Dzouza and Archana Puran Singh overdoing comedy. the music of this film is weird except one song that everyone loved was Dil De Diya Hai sung by Anand Raj Anand i still say that what is the most serious,sad & romantic song doing in this this film,but it is still a great track 10 years have passed i love it. My rating for Masti is 7/10 only because few things are overdone & it ended too soon,there is a sequel coming in 2013 its called Grand Masti 2013 i cant wait for it to see.Masti 2004 is a must see",
         "oh my!! this film has to get a 10/10 from me! it was too funny! seriously... the actors are really good they really know how to do a comedy role!... the fist time i watched this film i laughed my ass off... and every time i see it now i still laugh my face off... its well funny how everything goes wrong... i love the part where the gold gloves thief's are meant to come n steel money for the pay of murdering that girl... then the real burglars come and take all the money... they they kill that other man by accident...and in all its all just a set up from there wives!... oh my god!... this movie is just to funny!! if you haven't seen it..please go see it!! u will love it...trust me!",
         "I love this movie! I have watched this movie many times, and I grow to love it every time. Vivek Oberoi shows loads of potential in this film. He has a a possible flair for comedy and its so fun to watch him! He is pretty cute, and his expressions and actions are hilarious. Aftab Shivdasani, shocked me. He is actually brilliant! I always thought Vivek overshadowed the other two protagonists, but I was obviously wrong! He still has a long way to go, of course, but this is a great start. Ritesh Deshmukh is probably the least funny, but nevertheless, he gives it a shot. The second half belongs to him completely. The three heroines, Amrita Rao, Tara Sharma and Genelia D'Souza, play their roles very well, though I personally feel that Amrita Rao overshadows them all. Not only in looks, but in acting too. Ajay Devgan and Lara Dutta also play parts in this movie. A very impressive performance by each of them, though I feel Ajay was slightly wasted. Comedy all the way.",
         "Masti means fun and although the plot of this wonderfully hilarious film borders on the dark side of Masti, it nevertheless has its moments and ultimately delivers what it hoped it would at the start of it all, pure entertainment for one and all. Three men (Vivek Oberoi, Ritesh Deshmukh, and Aftab Shivdasani) upon graduating college, fear what awaits them as they are now eligible bachelors for marriage. The fear that once the get hitched, they would lose their friendship and all that mattered to them as singles. They can lament all they want but slowly and surely, one by one they begin to marry and the years pass by. One day, a chanced reunion sets them taking a trip down memory lane when one of them decides that they can recapture the decadence of their youth by having affairs and they all decide that yes it's the right thing to do. At this point in the film, you will wonder why good-looking men who are married to good-looking women (played by Amrita Rao, Genelia D'Souza and Tara Sharma respectively) would think of such a thing? But when the camera introduces you to the object of their attraction, I guess you can sort of understand why. This Femme Fatale that attracts all three men on separate occasions is played by none other than former beauty queen Lara Dutta. And the song and dance she does with Oberoi is especially spectacular. The casting department for Kaal must have noticed the blinding chemistry between Oberoi and Dutta in this film first. Just wait until all three of them find out that they've been cheating on their wives with the same woman, you will laugh your head off! Archana Puran Singh, Satish Shah and Ajay Devgan round out the supporting cast with hip-slapping-gut-ripping comedic roles. I didn't like the premise of cheating in the film but I couldn't help but laugh as the plot unfolded. If you don't like the premise of men cheating either, just sit back and watch the plot of Masti unfold. This film is one of my favourites."

         "A murder is committed in a town in India and the Police ask a senior policeman to deal with his matter. His name is Sikanker and he begins his investigations and after doing so, he finds that he has three suspects. Three men, who are all married, but have been involved in seducing a woman named Monica. The three men are Amar, Prem, and Meet, who all claim their innocence - but in Sikander's books - they are all guilty until they prove themselves innocent. How can they prove themselves innocent, when their very wives will refuse to speak up on their behalf?",
         "Meet, Amar and Prem have been married for the last 3 years and bored of their quirky wives. So when they meet for the first time in three years, they decide to indulge in affairs and \"get some action\". They meet again after a month to compare notes, but discover each one of them has had a liaison with a wily woman Monica. She blackmails her into bringing her a lot of money or else she would inform their wives of their infidelity. The friends manage to get the money somehow, but the events soon escalate into a nightmare: the trio have to deal with a murder, a dead body, another blackmailer, and an extremely suspicious police officer named Inspector Sikandar while ensuring that not a word reaches their wives.",
         "Marriage is supposed to be made in heaven. But, for three friends -- Meet, Amar and Prem -- it has become hell on earth. For Meet, whose name means \"lover\" in Hindi, marriage has crimped his \"cool stud\" lifestyle. His wife Aanchal makes sure he cools his heels at home. Prem's parents forced him to marry Geeta, a sweet, innocent and \"my husband-is-my-god\" kind of woman. She would rather press his feet than \"you know what.\" Amar is terrified of his wife Bindiya and her equally domineering mother, who lives with them. When these three buddies meet up after three years, their frustrations with marriage fuel their conversation. They decide the only way to spice up their lives is have as many affairs as possible for the next month. Then, they'll regroup and exchange notes. So, the rollicking process starts as the three men go looking for \"biryaani.\" With Inspector Sikander hot on their trial, they find themselves in one crazy situation after another as the film races to its hilarious climax.",
         "Meet three married men, Prem, Meet and Amar, who have been married for a few years, but already have the \"seven year itch\". They decide to be bachelors for a few days, and take advantage of their new-found freedom by flirting and having affairs with attractive young women. They do find three women, one who turns to be a transvestite; the second who wants to take photos of naked men for a commercial; and the third lifeless = dead. Before the hapless trio can stock of what has happened, they find themselves as prime suspects by a very suspicious Police Inspector Sikander, who has taken a personal dislike to them, and wants them to be in his custody, so he can work them over, in return for a confession; and of a black-mailer who has some very revealing photographs, for which he wants a hefty sum - a sum the trio can only obtain by stealing.",
