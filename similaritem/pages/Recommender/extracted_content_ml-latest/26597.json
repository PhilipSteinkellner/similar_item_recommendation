         "Here in Norway, the Swedes have a reputation of being a bit crazy, and films like this don't exactly make them look any more sane. (*Small spoiler alert*) I shall admit it at once. I simply love this humorous madness. Unforgettable scenes like the one in the cafeteria where a guy drops his hat in the soup and starts a mass riot or the one where Gunnar Volt walks to a hot dog kiosk in his sleep and thinks that the hot dogs are hand grenades make me laugh out loud every time I think about them. Apart from these moments, the rest of the film is also brilliantly crafted. Everything from \"special effects\" to the charming musical numbers are just delightful. The main cast of only seven people are an energetic bunch, especially Anders Eriksson, who is so full of humorous energy that you find yourself smiling every time he enters the screen, not to mention when he is dancing. The story fits perfectly into the crazy comedy style. Everything in the small town of Rotum circulates around a weapon factory that is illegally selling weapons to Iran and Libya, and it's unnecessary to tell that the film is quite satirical towards the Swedish government. All in all, \"Leif\" has the potential to delight people in numerous countries. It is simply one of the best comedies I have ever seen. I give it 10/10.",
         "'Leif' is clearly Galenskaparna & After Shave's best feature film, followed by 'Macken'. Leif is one of my favourite Swedish comedies of all time. It's Claes Eriksson's debut as a feature film director, as well as it's the group's first film, so there's a bit of 'pioneer feeling' to it. I really recommend it, it's a funny film.",
         "This is one of the best/funniest movies ever made in Sweden or anywhere for that matter. Best line is: \"Leif, Leif, Leif what have you done?\" See it, you'll love it! Claes Eriksson is fantastic as Max and his brother, Anders Ericsson, is brilliant as the Manager of the weapon factory, Rotums canons and gunpowder. With the slogan: You can't compete with us, smallest try is stopped by us, we are smarter than you can be, oh how smart we are! The Bofors (swedish weapon manufacturer) scandal is ridiculed! All of the music and lyrics in the movie is great, and written by Claes Ericsson and performed by Galenskaprna and Aftershave. Leif \"EN KANON FILM!\"",
         "The Swedish comedy group Galenskaparna och Aftershave(\"Madnessmakers\" and Aftershave) have just as Monty Python for BBC been making sketch comedy series for Swedish TV as well as live shows, and just as absurd and surreal as their British inspirators. Sadly only one full scale film has come from the swedes. Still, it's better than nothing, very much so. The film LEIF would be an anti war cult film if it wasn't Swedish. It definitely is meant a big kick in the face to the blooming Swedish weapons industry, as it in an obvious parody of arms sales, small town and international politics, together with warfare in general. The parody of this and the Swedish small town society is perhaps overdone and the identity crises of the main character is quite silly, but it doesn't matter. All in all it's a hilarious plot with some sequences so funny that only the Pythons are able to match it. The style with making sketch scenes within the big plot works here, and are surely very laughable. The funniest ever canteen fighting scene is a top moment, together with the idea of making dance bands on an assembly line. This is very mad humor but with a serious political statement as an undertone. See it !!!"
