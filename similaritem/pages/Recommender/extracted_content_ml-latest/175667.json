         "Columbus, like many recent indie films, draws from the realities often overlooked and almost even concealed by the overpowering push toward modernity. Kogonada elucidates the real life emotions interwoven by relationships that are unhampered by technology; optimistically demonstrating how our feelings and thoughts are so salient in face to face experience that sustaining our reticence becomes more than unreasonable. The film is minimalistic in almost every sense; whether in the subtlety and astuteness of Hammock's music, the alluring stillness of Elisha Christian's cinematography or simply the fact that it was filmed entirely in Columbus Indiana over 18 days. The portrayals of Jin & Casey by John Cho & Haley Lu Richardson are overwhelmingly distilled and encapsulate the emotions of the characters in such a way to inspire both progressive introspection & nostalgia for a seemingly boundless innocence. Though Columbus is dimly innovative, Kogonada shows an incredible attention to detail creating a powerful and cohesive film that is more than worth a watch.",
         "Saw this at the Rotterdam film festival 2017 (website: iffr.com), where it was selected for the Hivos Tiger Competition. Relevant drama, realistic people, realistic situations, and realistic issues everyone can be forced to deal with when it happens to them. Pity that the dialogs were not always completely understandable, so I missed some nuances but certainly not the main topics at hand. Another minus point is that it took some time to establish who was who and what their relationships were. So I have to recommend everyone to read the synopsis beforehand. The situations of the two main protagonists has many similarities that binds them together after a random encounter while taking a smoking break outside, though it takes some time before they really open up to one another and clarify their respective situations towards another (and implicitly to oneself, as a side effect). For some reason, festival visitors were only halfway impressed how their issues were portrayed, as this movie ranked at a 80th place (out of 172) with score 3.856 (out of 5). Korean tradition states that when a parent dies, the son should be there when it happens, otherwise he cannot really mourn. So Jin is forced to wait until either his father is stable enough to bring him back to Korea, or when he fully recovers, or when he dies within the foreseeable future. The latter option is preferable, from a purely practical viewpoint, all things considered and setting all feelings aside. Anyway, Jin is here now following the \"family first\" tradition in his country to drop everything in case of family issues. Similarly, Casey is in a limbo wait state because of her mother. She postpones her plans for the future more or less indefinitely, very possibly even until it is too late for starting a promising career. Her mother stays a few times in some sort of clinic, and the interaction with staff is a bit cumbersome, though not clear (to me) what exactly the problem is. It looks like staff finds excuses on behalf of her mom why she cannot answer the phone or why she cannot meet. There was one example where Jin and Casey were outside the clinic, discussing the architecture of the clinic as exemplary transparent (plenty of glass), allowing them to see one of the nurses answering the phone but apparently acting differently from what she promised to do. It is one example where the architectural tour through the city coincides with their domestic issues. Precisely this common dilemma brings Casey and Jin together. That they meet is pure accident due to Casey taking a smoking break outside, and Jin is outside walking and thinking in himself. Jin's father is a scholar in architecture, while Casey recently finished her study in architecture, and often giving tours through the city for interested guests. Apparently, the city where it all happens, is full of original architecture, ahead of its time when it was built. Their relationship starts thus on architecture as a common ground to talk about, and it takes some time for both to open up about their real problems centering around their respective parents and how to escape from their respective wait states. Parallel to her encounters with Jin, Casey meets many times with a colleague at the library where she works. She interacts with him while at work and during smoking breaks. Their relationship is warm and intimate but not in the sexual sense. At the same time Jin meets with his sister every now and then. These parallel interactions offer ample opportunities to clarify the situation they are in, but not on the deeply-understanding-level as Casey and Jin together do. All in all, the dramatic developments are logically arranged in a perfect screenplay, that allows us to identify ourselves with all the protagonists, each of them relevant to the story in their own right. This movie stands out positively in the Tiger Competition, half of which was a waste of time, but this one certainly was not.",
         "I really enjoyed this movie, even though it was easily the slowest paced movie I have ever seen. I'm not sure why this worked. It was almost as if the movie gave the viewer time to think about the characters because there were so many pauses in dialog. There was a mysterious \"real life\" experience to watching the movie, unlike any I had ever had before, and I found myself thinking about the characters for days afterwards in the way I might think about a puzzling friend. \"Columbus\" should have been boring, but it wasn't.",
         "Much like the city that bears the film's name, Columbus is a rare unspoiled gem in a sea of same-old, same-old. It's a spellbinding whisper; a soulful, sweet and self-assured voice that you can only hear if you can calm your mind for long enough. The film takes something as simple as two strangers getting to know each other and elevates it to an art with unspoken spiritual dimensions. Every frame truly is a painting here. The colors on the palette \u2013 our actors and the man made wonders that occupy the space. The film begins with the collapse of an elderly Korean scholar who was in town to give a talk on modernist architecture. He slips into a coma, anticipating the arrival of his son Jin (Cho). Jin in turn is forced to put his life in Seoul on hold as he waits for either the death or recovery of his estranged father. While this is happening, Casey (Richardson) a bright, kindhearted towny and unabashed lover of architecture approaches Jin while out for an afternoon stroll. The two kindle a friendship that subtly shifts their perspectives; a bond that is as deeply felt as it is melancholy. No words can truly describe freshman writer-director Kogonada vision in this film. Dreamy, contemplative, ethereal \u2013 all worthy words in any context but in film they come not as adjectives but unfortunate value statements. We as a culture have silently, perhaps subconsciously ascribed these words to mean languid and boring, refusing to acknowledge any portents of purposeful design. I myself have fallen into this trap plenty of times. I've watched a grand total of three Yasujiro Ozu films over the course of my life, and all three times I have been left wanting. Kogonada is certainly mimicking aspects of Ozu here, including a deeply wistful tone and using water as a leitmotif. But Kogonada's approach does have some stark differences. For one, large generational shifts in understanding are treated in an overall positive light. Casey's astute work friend Gabriel (Culkin) expounds with increasing clarity the idea that different interests and habits don't necessarily mean we lose sight of what's important. As the film meanders through its story, the camera holds lovingly on Indiana's strange architectural wonderland as if to say the wise and the eternal can coexist with the new and the modern. In its own unassuming way, Columbus almost acts like a critique of a critique. Most of the time however, Columbus is a beautifully captured human story pure and simple. The odd coupling of John Cho and Haley Lu Richardson is reminiscent of Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray in Lost in Translation (2003) only both are objectively less world-weary. As an actress of incredible, disarming vulnerability, Richardson fills every room, field and parking lot like a beam of sunlight. She's always had warmth to her popular performances but with Columbus she proves that she's much more than a pretty face. John Cho likewise is tremendous as the prickly and wounded Jin. The script requires that the narrative chips away at his tough exterior slowly. Thus all the guilt, anger and regret he wells up inside needs to stay just exposed enough to hold the audience interest. It's a harder thing to do than it looks but thankfully Cho pulls it off with aplomb. If Columbus has any fatal flaws it strictly has to do with scale. The film dwells on the inscrutability of life and the beauty of the world if one only looks, but then folds all these ideas in a movie tacitly about daddy issues and life no longer being a tutorial. Additionally it can be argued that if this is a movie about looking, watching and appreciating, than why are we following two people who use looking, watching and appreciating architecture as a cudgel? Personally when I watched Columbus I was struck by its serenity. It reminded me of a Lao Tzu poem I once read that more or less goes like this: The supreme good is like water, Which nourishes all things without trying to. It is content with the low places that people disdain. This it is like the Tao. In dwelling, live close to the ground. In thinking, keep to the simple. In conflict, be fair and generous. In governing, don't try to control. In work, do what you enjoy. In family, be completely present. When you are content to be simply yourself And don't compare or compete, Everybody will respect you.",
         "The quiet indie drama \"Columbus\" won't win over many mainstream moviegoers, but cinema academic-turned-filmmaker Kogonada has crafted a visually immaculate feature debut that can be compared to little else. As artistically distinctive as the film may be, the story will feel familiar: A man named Jin (John Cho) ends up in the rural town of Columbus, Indiana when his father goes into a coma and meets a young woman named Casey (Haley Lu Richardson) unable to uproot herself from this modern architecture mecca. Their collision of perspectives as they tour her favorite buildings and learn about each other's challenges and hopes makes up the reflective heart of the narrative. Yet there's a third obvious character in this story and that's Columbus. Not its people or culture, but its structures. Kogonada makes the presence of this setting palpable in most every shot. As we follow Jin and Casey from location to location, even the ones not designed by skilled architects, we're given time to absorb their surroundings, which may make us feel something that influences our perspective on the story. As the characters take in these thoughtfully designed structures, so do we. Imagine watching a play in an art museum - that's the best way to describe the dual artistic nature of \"Columbus.\" The choices Kogonada and cinematographer Elisha Christian make with the camera and lighting prove to be everything in this film. The calculation, symmetry and blocking show a meticulous amount of thought, detail and planning. Every shot is its own portrait, as though the film is a 100-minute contemporary art exhibition. Some portraits will move you more than others. Plus, there's the additional layer of how that portrait influences not just the viewer's perception, but the story unfolding. Kogonada doesn't care much for plot specifics, and to a degree that fences us off from these characters because we can only invest so deeply in their personal conflicts, but the portraits of Jin and especially Casey are extensive enough that we have plenty to observe and react to in the film. Richardson's performance stands out the most in the way she continues to wrestle with her guarded nature and self-prescribed future and begins to lose a grip on her emotional control. Foremost, \"Columbus\" is a reflective viewing experience. With almost no film score, we're not meant to get enthralled by the film so much as bring our attention to it and experience it in this visual, contemplative way. It requires an appreciation for the craft of creating a frame to be sure, but it's good enough that it might make some new film appreciation \"students\" out of more casual indie film fans. ~Steven C Thanks for reading!

         "Greetings again from the darkness. The first feature film from Korean writer/director/editor Kogonada provides intimate and revealing slices of life that are somehow simultaneously familiar, thought-provoking, and enlightening. There is so much going in this seemingly quiet little story that we are left thinking that it could easily have been split into 2 or 3 movies. Haley Lu Richardson stars as Casey, a local girl who works in the library and as a tour guide. She's clearly smart, and readily admits to sacrificing her future for the responsibility of looking after her mother (Michelle Forbes) \u2013 a recovering addict to both meth and \"s***heads\". Her exchanges with Gabriel (Rory Culkin) carry the weight of intellects-in-development, as well as strained attraction that is regularly shut down through sneakily awkward and uncomfortable moments. Their back-and-forth on reading, video games and attention spans is one of the best on-screen exchanges we will hear this year. The film begins with an elderly man having some type of seizure, sending him to the hospital and canceling his scheduled architecture presentation. His son Jin (John Cho) arrives from out of town and the next morning has an initial inelegant crossing of paths with Casey. The lack of connection between the two transforms in a beautifully written and photographed scene the next day. Shot from the other side of the window glass with no audible dialogue, we witness the moment Casey lets down her guard and Jin becomes enamored. It's a unique and wonderful scene \u2013 so quiet, yet it changes everything. Columbus, Indiana is the other star of the film. Its famous modern architecture is featured prominently throughout as Casey guides Jin to her favorites. Their corresponding conversations, usually while puffing on cigarettes, gradually become more detailed and more revealing. Doorways, bridges, windows, and buildings become part of the conversation, and crucial to the look and feel created by cinematographer Elisha Christian. Mr. Cho captures the stoic nature of a son inconvenienced by a Korean culture that requires him to be present should his father die. He is miffed by the need to 'adequately grieve' for the man who never put his own life on hold for his son. Ms. Richardson is the revelation here. Having seen her in SPLIT, THE EDGE OF SEVENTEEN, and THE BRONZE, it was obvious she had screen presence, but here she shows the depth and range that portends a long and varied acting career. Her slumped shoulders and panged expression are spot on for a 19 year old who is too smart for her situation, yet too young and unworldly to know how to forge ahead. Kogonada proves himself a sly storyteller as well as a master of visual setting, utilizing language, architecture and above all, conversation. At one point, Jin asks Casey \"Are we losing interest in everyday life?\" This filmmaker is doing his part to keep us aware and interested.",
         "\"Meth and modernism are really big here.\" Casey (Haley Lu Richardson) If you need an example of a modern art film, look no further than the Columbus film of Korean director Kogonada. It's a minimalist treatment of familial interaction and non-sexual intimacy worthy of Richard Linklater in his early Sunrise franchise. Its greatest achievement is bonding architecture with humanity so that the former becomes a character itself. As for the light tone of the opening quote, Columbus the film, in an act of humane tenderness, never makes fun of the people or the city. Korean Jin (John Cho) meets Casey in small town Columbus, Indiana. Although it feels a bit like a clichéd cow town, contrarily it has some of the best modernist architecture in the USA just as the couple deal with modern challenges as they blend their millennial dysfunctions with the seriousness of love and death. He is visiting his comatose architect father while she is fighting with herself to stay at home and tend to addicted mother while a university offering her fulfillment for her architectural enthusiasm is trying to tear her away. Although the two are developing love that is chaste and from afar, their conversation gradually takes on depth mirrored in the growing presence of buildings from the likes of Deborah Berke, Eero Saarinen, and James Stewart Polshek, a conjunction of the real and almost ethereal, as several of the stunningly stark, simple and transparent buildings reflect. That the director chooses to shoot a whole scene in a mirror, and others briefly is a tribute to the interest he has in appearance and reality and the importance of place. This intensely and immaculately filmed indie is a fitting declaration of the melancholy unity between living lovers and dynamic architecture. Enjoy the view and dialogue; movie-making doesn't need to offer more.",
         "'Love story that involves not just human relationships but relationships between architecture' was its clunky presentation to Australian audiences. That would usually be enough to turn me off. But I needed soothing after the toxic excesses of 'Mulholland Drive', wheeled out again the same US movie festival. Glad I gave it a spin. It very much moves at its own pace, but gets places in the end. Thoughtful M-F dialogue in beautiful settings almost lends this a Before Sunrise/Sunset vibe. But the different touch is that the man and woman are helping each other through to life's next staging posts, rather more so than falling for each other. She cares too much about her mother. He too little for his father. The director actually includes a dialogue that states this central proposition directly. That too would usually be a turnoff, but is less so here given the genuine credits built up by then. Haley Lu Richardson, doing quite a different character to her recent turn in Edge of 17, shows an actorly maturity beyond her years.",
         "This is one of those movies that tries to pretend it is deep by having long silences, little character development, vague background, a spotty plot (even for what plot there is). Leave enough such blanks, and certain viewers will fill them in (in various ways) and convince themselves they've just seen something profound. Like bad poetry, except that the dialogue here is far from poetic: \"I worry I'll hurt my mom. I worry I'll hurt you.\" \"You have to stop worrying about hurting people.\" \"You have to stop worrying about hurting people, too.\" So, long silences broken by inane dialogue from undeveloped characters in the most minimal of plots (no spoilers possible because nothing happens). Gave it two stars instead of one only because of some shots of interesting architecture, which is hardly enough to redeem this interminably dull movie.",
         "The cinematography and music is as architectural as Columbus, Ohio. Every image is focused on and framed by the architecture present. This beautifully emphasizes the thing that brings the two leads together. While it isn't necessarily a shared interest, architecture becomes a means to discuss what ails their lives. They come to compliment each other, in their differences. They are both very real, honest, open characters. The dialog asks the big questions: Is work more important than family? Is family more important than going after your dreams? The characters play with these ideas and confide in each other's different experiences. This movie is written, directed, and shot in the most architecturally stunning way. The performances are natural and honest. All around this is a must see. I cannot recommend it enough.",
         "Must start by saying John Cho and Haley Lu Richardson are great in the film. Haley Lu Richardson is especially watchable in this. For me the film was just way too pedestrian. It's a very thoughtful film and mature in it's feel. But if you had to sum up the film to a friend I'd struggle to actually say what it's about. Architecture? Relationships? Both I guess. But I didn't personally feel that's enough for a full length film. I kind of enjoyed it but if I'd skipped the last half I don't feel in any way I'd have lost out on anything memorable. Arty, but really it didn't make me think about anything other than trying to find a point to it. Maybe this is a film for film students and film festivals. Well made and nice looking with good acting, but pretty thin.",
         "I read several of the reviews before seeing this film. John Cho is usually pretty good. He brings a kind of thoughtfulness to the role. However, as far as pace is concerned, I've seen paint dry faster than this movie. Utterly one of those movies I might, or should have skipped. I can take some slow segments, but this was seriously slow. I never could get into the characters because of that. The one positive was the architecture though. Very nice. I'm originally from the mid-west and can relate to the quiet, peaceful towns through out the region. Columbus might be one of those places you'd want to be buried at. Summarizing this film, would be, slow. If you have 100 minutes to kill, this might be up your alley. Make sure you check your pulse from time to time.",
         "Columbus is written and directed by Kogonada, and it stars John Cho and Haley Lu Richardson. In this movie, Jin (Cho) is a Korean-born man that has to travel to Columbus, Indiana after his father went into a coma. During his time there, he meets a young American woman named Casey (Richardson), and they both form a connection. You want to talk about a disappointment? After seeing its Tomatometer score at 97%, and then reading the reviews that called it one of the best movies of 2017, I took that as a positive sign. And yesterday, I saw a Facebook post of someone really raving about it. So I commented on it, saying \"I'll be watching that tomorrow\". I wanted to believe that guy's word on it, and I really had high hopes for this movie. So as you can see where this is going, I just never felt connected with the majority of Columbus. And it's a shame, because it just got added on Hulu, which meant that I didn't have to spend $5 on an iTunes rental. I don't know what happened, you guys. It just didn't click with me like I was hoping it would. It's not like it was a terrible film. The actors are very strong, and I really liked the choices on the directing and cinematography. I think the pace of the story was moving too slow for me, and it wasn't catching my attention consistently. I literally had to pause the movie about 8 or 9 times, because I had other things I was thinking about or doing that this couldn't pull me away from. And it's not like the story or screen writing was bad. It just lacked that element of engagement that I wanted to feel. I want my indie romance films to connect with me and make me care about the characters and what they're going through. It was like they were missing that part, at least in my opinion. It's not a bad film, but it was a disappointing one that I really wanted to like more than I do. Eh, it happens. Score: 49/100 Recommendation: Any fans of indie romance films will have better luck with the story than I did.",
         "100 minutes never seemed so long. The architecture of Columbus, Indiana, does not receive enough screen time. The characters in this movie need a great deal of analysis, since they seem to be in funk most of the time. The dialogue is the opposite of crisp. You could take a nap between some of the speeches, as the actors attempt to add depth by simply speaking very, very slowly about pretty mundane things. Hard to figure out who some of the characters are. A great deal of humor involved in just asking if mother is on meth. Over and over. It was no funnier the fourth time. OK, it is an art film. Maybe that explains why it is so hard to follow. Interesting sounds and camera angles will entertain film students. If you want a good story, go elsewhere.",
         "I am one that usually does not mind 'slow-moving' films, but this one was ridiculous! I could hear the ear wax growing in my ears during the long, long silences. The spoken word was like rain in a desert, few and too far between. The story wasn't bad, but if you left out all the silences, the movie would have probably been 20 minutes long. Plus, I just wanted to shake the female lead and yell at her, \"Get the hell out of there already!\"",
         "What a movie!! Real life story and wonderful acting by all. The best revelation is Haley Lu Richardson. Wonderful calm movie. Really appreciate this movie.",
         "This film demands patience but it does deliver. While still in suspense as to relationships, background facts and a broad overview, the viewer is entertained with gorgeous photography and glimpses of superb architecture, both interior and exterior. No all the blanks will not be filled in, but the total experience is very worthwhile, especially if one considers beauty sufficient sometimes.",
         "This was by far the least enjoyable movie I have seen in recent memory. Which was also the conclusion of my wife and our two companions. As one of us said at the end, \"Who do I call to get my two hours back?\" I love architecture and am familiar with the reputation of Columbus, Indiana -- but the director's interminable shots of its landmarks were repetitive and uninspired. And that was the movie's most interesting element! We saw this at the Landmark theaters in Los Angeles, and noted a number of patrons walking out it the middle. Note: This review contains no spoilers because nothing happens to spoil. (Or is that itself a spoiler?)",
         "It's bad enough that this movie is so sloooooooowwwwwww and that the conclusion is obvious long before it arrives. What makes it really bad is that every character, at every critical moment, lights a cigarette. It's obvious that they got money from the tobacco industry! I object to gratuitous smoking. If the plot leads to lung cancer, that's fine. But what this movie does is tell the audience that the way to deal with stress is to light up a cigarette. That makes it a cigarette advertisement, which used to be banned (and still should be!) Apart from that, if you need a good nap, go see Columbus, If you sleep through any of it you can figure it out.",
         "I'm truly amazed by this movie and how beautfully was shot. Every shot was precised, balanced and the most important aspect that it had soul. Every shot that I saw, tried to tell something, and had a meaning. The camera barely moves, it doesn't want you to move either, it wants you to pay attention to the details and to the characters interactions. I really loved the calm slow pacing, it felt dream-like, and thanks to the great sound design the atmosphere, the sounds felt so alive, almost touchable. I think everybody can relate to each of the characters and their stories... The passionate young girl who wants to follow her dream but also she needs to look after her mother, and the son who never came out with his father and now his father dying. The instresting thing is that how the director wants to tell these stories. And it really works with all the characters. Their interactions with eachother and how they're connected with the love of architecture is so uplifting heartwarming, and intimate. A very beutiful movie about human interactions trough art. (sorry for my engilish)",
         "You couldn't shoot this movie in any other town. What first time director Kogonada finds in Columbus is a simple thesis; modernist architecture, by the likes of designers such as Eero Saarinen, Harry Weese, and I.M. Pei, their great planes of glass, jutting edges and spires, sharp dividing lines, and the lonely citizens that are framed by them, their lives impossibly tangled, their pathways weaving in and out of these pillars. For Casey, one of the sleepy town's youngest inhabitants (that has the freedom to leave), they may be her small consolation prize. She works in one of the fabled buildings, the Cleo Rogers Memorial Library, but spends most of that time shelving dusty books instead of gazing at the ceilings. Her first scene betrays her passion, a smoke-break turned daydream as she mumbles out imaginary tour guide sound bites across from the First Christian Church, teasing out the intricacies of its deliberate asymmetrical design. Yet these sleek walls and panels have little appeal when they reveal their contents; a heartbreaking scene where Casey surveys the glass interiors like a prison made for her mother, a recovered drug addict who cleans all night long. If you study her wardrobe you'll notice key design choices made to indicate Casey as an old soul, matured much beyond the confines of the titular town. Baggy mum jeans, loose-fitting blouses, long dresses bunched around her sandals. Yes, she's the responsible parent of the family, chasing up her daughter's missed phone calls, charging up to school with a firm reminder of her pick-up time. There's a slightly off-kilter moment where she declares her allegiance to old technology, \"Smart phone, dumb human.\" Haley Lu Richardson delivers much of her dialogue gazing off-screen, with a wistful smile that doesn't quite reach her eyes. The mood in the Columbus air is melancholy. That draws John Cho's Jin closer, who can't wait to get out of town. Together they excavate the baggage of their difficult parent relationships, with conversations that tiptoe lightly around the subject, but withdraw quickly. Cho in particular does well with what he is given. His father only briefly graces the screen in the opening of the film, with Jin's actions made to outline the rough sketches of their strained relationship; a slight hesitant step before entering the hospital room, a retreat from the suffocating confines of modern living to nature outside. Even without knowing much about the man behind the mysterious pseudonym, you could pinpoint his favoured sources of inspiration. But we don't have to dig too deep. For those invested in the video essay scene, Kogonada will be a familiar face, known for years for his Vimeo-uploaded super-cuts exhibiting the immaculate centred frames of Kubrick, the flattened, scrapbook formalism of Wes Anderson, Ozu's penchant for boxing in his subjects with doorways and windows and walls. It's all there in Columbus, which embraces austere formalism like an old friend. If it wasn't already obvious enough, the director's alias is seemingly taken from Kogo Noda, Ozu's longtime scriptwriter collaborator. Kogonada has written and edited here, and he might as well be the DP too; the film's tableus are constructed from ground up, with the characters arranged around the architecture and dictated by the strong lines, not the other way around. While they weave in and out, and trudge to and from mirrors and showers, the camera is still. They'll be obscured behind glass, or heard from behind a corner, or framed through a corridor. Even strolling through an office, the line of desks are arrow straight, and the sticky notes are placed impeccably. Rarely does Kogonada cut to a closeup. When he does for what should be the most revealing moment of the film, where Jin presses Casey for what truly moves her about these buildings, it's merely to resort to a disappointing indie cliché - deigetic sound cuts out, and she confesses wordlessly over soft music. I should be feeling more for this girl. She veers a little into cliché, but there's a worldly weariness about her that separates from the usual archetype. Richardson's ability to sudden crumble under the weight of all her anxieties, seen in another muted moment in the car, is extraordinary. She suddenly reverts to the child that had to see her mother as an addict at fourteen. Yet her overall journey is so isolated from the rest of the plot. She weeps on behalf of her mother, who doesn't even get a say in this decision. And what of her and Jin's tumultuous relationship? They're willing to aim barbed insults at each other and then be cordial the next meeting. He doesn't even eventually get the chance to shed tears, or muse on the lack of them.",
         "I feel like the movie tries too hard to come off as incredibly intelligent and profound, but overall it's merely quite boring to watch, very slow paced, and there's far too many repetitive shots of buildings. I mean my god does the director love symmetry, it's like every other shot is lined up perfectly symmetrical. All it showcases is a very poor skill at cinematography and a fairly average skill at photography. As for the plot, although it does develop the characters nicely, and touches on some very real life problems, it's all however quite.... depressing. I wouldn't dream of rewatching this movie for the directing, nor the story. And even the topics based on architecture were fairly disinteresting, especially considering I'm a student of the subject. In conclusion this movie really doesn't have much going for it so I really can't recommend it. I will however give full props to Haley Lu Richardson for an exceptional performance, an actor I'll have to look out for in future. Kogonada however I think I'll have to pass.",
         "This film, obviously shot with architecture in mind, has a story that could be told in about 20 seconds. In effect, the film never actually starts. If you have trouble sleeping, and have about three spare sessions, or days, then watch this film, you will be cured, rest assured. The music alone sends one into a hypnotic spiral of wine induced sleepiness. This said, i did watch the whole darn thing, i did rate it more than one star, and there are actually worse movies out there. I would say, go into this one with your eyes open, but that might not last very long.",
         "This is the kind of 'stop and smell the roses' movie that is rarely seen in the American cinema. Of course, it's an art-house indie, but, still a pleasing occurrence to be saluted. It's also heartening to see that it has done well this weekend in very limited release (but, sadly, my instincts tell me it won't expand well). John Cho plays Jin who's father has collapsed on the eve of a lecture on architecture the dad was going to give. This brings him to the small town of Columbus Indiana to visit the hospital. There he meets a young 19 year old named Casey (Haley Lu Richardson; very winning) who's a librarian that happens to be an architecture buff (and Columbus happens to be a small architecture mecca). The two strike up an odd relationship something akin to Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannson's in LOST IN TRANSLATION. Like that film, COLUMBUS isn't really about the 'plot'. The pair walk around the town and visit the various famous buildings and muse on their lives - some mundane, others more profound. The movie is strikingly framed to capture the buildings and surroundings (unfortunately, it was shot on middling digital otherwise it could have been a knockout visually). Director Kogonada is never in a rush and he allows the characters and the mood to breathe. On has to submit to its rhythm. There are a few missteps towards the end which seem out of place in this quiet meditative drama, but, it's still worth a visit to stop and....see the sights.",
         "These are the films I love to watch ones with great actors and great cinematography and so so so so much symbolism. I love the scene in particular when they are talking outside the building and when what seems like a important part of the conversation it turns to silence and we see them talking but don't hear what they are saying which I believe is symbolic for one of the ideas of their relationship which is everything even the little things can be left up to your own interpretation. That's just one of many in this film."
