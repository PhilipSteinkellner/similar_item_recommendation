         "I started watching this film really hoping that it would be everything that it claims it is: a stylish revenge tale to rival The Godfather itself. In actual fact, this is not a revenge tale and gets no-where near to The Godfather. A film essentially based around the rise and fall of a Brazilian pimp, it seems to me like it's confused about it's own nature and motivations as well as those of the characters; I was never sure if it was intended as a glorification or a condemnation of the Brazilian sex industry lifestyle. Also, characters seem to disappear without explanation and core aspects of the plot seem to be forgotten within a matter of minutes. There is a lot of potential in the characters and plot of this film, but due to poor scripting and the short runtime (100 minutes is not enough time for a crime epic) and Boca is almost unfinished in this sense, the film is a mess and exploration into motivation, generally turning the pace down a notch and stretching the runtime could have made this a film worth watching. Unfortunately, there are too many basic flaws to make this a decent film in my opinion.",
         "The Storyline that is listed just about Explains the Story. About a man from a Sao Paulo neighborhood, notorious for it's Bars, Nightclubs, and Local crime figures. Story starts in early 50's and continues to the mid 60's; Hiroito, the man in this story is shown growing up, and how he eventually gets involved in a Life of Crime. From what I read after I watched this film, Hiroito did some time in Prison, and went on to write a Book about his life. That Book is what the Movie is based on. I can't believe No one has bothered to Review this so far. The Movie, to me, was a good 'crime story'; he was known locally, and made quite a name for himself (criminally speaking). I kind of hope that Hirohito will eventually Post here, and give his impression IF the Film was true to his book. Since I knew absolutely nothing about the MOVIE, except the Storyline, I nevertheless took a chance and spent an hour or so and watched. Not sure if the Actors in this film are known or unknown, but they were all convincing to me, as far as portraying their Characters. Hate to give anything away (SPOILER)- but I wonder what Hiroito was thinking, when he saw the kid he Rescued, playing with other kids??"
