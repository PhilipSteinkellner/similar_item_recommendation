Such bravery and beauty that should teach all of us how to live life and to cherish every moment that we have. Kudos to all involved including the parents, the soundtrack, the directing, and of course the star \"The butterfly girl\". I definitely will have to watch it again. I plan on having my kids see the film so they can truly see what it means to rise above obstacles and challenges in your life and to embrace every moment with happiness and cherish each day as if it were your last regardless of how hard it may be. Abigail is so fun to watch and is a very beautiful girl. I was truly touched."],

She is a typical teenager: moody, rebellious, irreverent, and is also strikingly beautiful. But her life is the antithesis of normal. Abbie grew up in hospitals, cared for by her protective mother and father. She then came into her own in honky tonks, selling merchandise for her dad's band. But just like any other 18 year-old, Abbie yearns for a life of her own. Butterfly Girl charts Abbie's journey towards a new understanding of how she must balance her past with her future, her parents with her independence, and her disease with her desires. But what price must she pay for that freedom?"],
