         "Uproarious World War II farce about the hotel of the title. Yvonne DeCarlo and Peter Ustinov as the proprietors, trying to survive the war but sitting in just the right place in the desert that the hotel changes sides depending on how the battle is going that week. The British move in, then out as the Germans move in, then out. Yvonne DeCarlo changes her personality, her wardrobe and her musical numbers to fit whoever the current occupiers happen to be. Hilarious ending has all sides occupying the hotel all at once. And you thought Yvonne DeCarlo was just Herman Munster's wife! Too bad this one isn't on video somewhere. Well worth a look if you happen to run across it.",
         "This is a fairly frenetic farce which stars the marvellous Peter Ustinov.In this film each of the countries fighting in the desert occupies the hotel in turn and brings with it their own nationalistic quirks.There are some funny moments but unfortunately at 96 minutes it is just to long.Certainly by the time the French take over you are just wishing for it to come to a quick conclusion.The cast is first rate and does the best they can with the somewhat limited material.Ustinov is funny as the hotel proprietor.It was truly the world,s loss when he died .He was a uniquely gifted personality and there are not a lot of those around.",
         "Copyright 15 October 1951 by Tower Films, Ltd. U.S. release through United Artists Pictures: 15 October 1951. New York opening at the Rialto: 31 December 1951. U.K. release through General Film Distributors: 6 August 1951. Australian release through British Empire Films: 10 October 1952. 8,649 feet. 96 minutes. Cut to 87 minutes in the U.S.A. and Australia. A Tower Films Production, presented by the J. Arthur Rank Organisation. SYNOPSIS: When war comes to the desert, Emad (Peter Ustinov) the proprietor of a luxury hotel by Kafka Oasis, finds himself, his fianc√©e Yasmin (Yvonne De Carlo) and his future mother-in-law Madame Pallas (Mireille Perrey) engulfed in the conflict by the sudden declaration of hostilities by the Italians. Against his better judgment he is prevailed upon by Yasmin to remain, face the music and protect his property, for therein lies their future life together. COMMENT: There was a promising comic central idea at the back of this tired, dispirited, slow-moving and lackluster farce; but few of its comic potentialities have been realized on the screen \u2014 thanks to a largely witless script that, like a stage play, is wholly confined within the precincts of the Hotel Sahara (except for a couple of brief scenes). The film is also far too talkative, and is peopled by one- dimensional characters that not even a talent like Ustinov's can illuminate, hampered as he is by Annakin's slow and painstakingly routine direction. Miss De Carlo looks pretty in her extensive wardrobe and even dances and sings a bit. Tomlinson has a small part, Culver is his usual self and the rest of the players are somewhat dull. Cutting would help.",
         "HOTEL SAHARA is a British black and white wartime farce set in North Africa during the Second World War. The two main cast members are a youthful Peter Ustinov and an ever-gorgeous Yvonne De Carlo. They play the exasperated proprietors of a hotel who have to change their attitudes and allegiances every time a new squad of soldiers shows up, because due to their important position in the desert they're constantly visited by the Germans, Italians, British, and French. Although this is the kind of film which feels very dated to modern audiences, it reminded me a little of 'ALLO 'ALLO and it has the same sense of anything-goes fun. The solid supporting cast, including Bill Owen and Roland Culver, also helps to increase the enjoyment factor."
