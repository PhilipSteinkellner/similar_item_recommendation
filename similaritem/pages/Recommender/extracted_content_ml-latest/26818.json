         "Great sequel here as Jet returns as Fong Sai Yuk. His character is darker in this one and that also describes the overall tone of the movie. Jet Li is amazing as usual and uses different weapons too. The villain Yu is ruthless in this one who doesn't let anything or anyone stand in his way (especially Jet). Their battles are fast and intense. I think the final fight is so creative and had me on edge to see what would happen next. I've never seen benches and tables used in that way. Really cool. Supporting cast includes Josepine Siao as Miss Fong who provides for a lot of laughs. She is at her best when she has to intervene for her son and has a great way of explaining things! Ting Ting (Michelle Reis) has a little competition with pretty (Angie) Amy Kwok and I like how they included a triangle in this one. Overall, this has more action and less comedy than the first one. You cannot miss when Jet dons the shades. Super cool.",
         "This is one of the best Jet Li films that I have saw. It ranks up there with 'Once Upon A Time In China' series. The fight sequences are breath taking and the acting is top quality. This is how a good historical film should be made. With humour, action, romance, etc. Not only Jet Li was superb but the whole cast too. 10 out of 10.",
         "Newly married, Fong Sai Yuk has joined the secret society of the red flower, seeking to over throw the oppressive Emperor and establish a new dynasty in its place. When a soothsayer declares that the leader of the society is actually in line to be Emperor but that he sees one of his closest friends will betray him, while another will intervene to rescue him. With this news, the leader sends a group of men to capture a box belonging to a rival, a box that holds the truth about his lineage. When the first mission fails, Fong is sent on a more covert mission to try and get the box � however the internal conflict within the Red Flower society is great and the presence of Fong's mother isn't really helping his stature with his peers. Having really enjoyed the first Fong Sai Yuk film I was looking forward to this film and, despite it being a bit less fun, it was an enjoyable film. The plot is a bit better than the first film and is easier to get into once it settles down from the first few minutes but it is more serious than it needed to be and it sucks a lot of the comedy out of it at the same time. This is a bit of a problem since the thing I enjoyed about the first film was that it was pretty freewheeling and funny, but it wasn't a problem to the point that I disliked the film just to the point where it didn't feel like it was being loyal to the spirit of the first film. It still does have the same sense of humour but it has fewer chances to come through despite still having enough laughs to do the job. Some are inspired lunacy (the chicken nerve freeze) but others are unintentional (witness, if you will, the hilariously fake horses they are seen riding in close up shots). The action is fun but not as impressive as it could have been, with only some of the fights really being technically impressive as well as fun. Jet Li still has a good presence but, despite not being as well served by the material, he is still a good lead. However, as with the first film, it is left to Siao to produce a lot of laughs and the film noticeably lightens whenever she is on screen; yes she gets dragged into the darker side of the story as well but for the most part she is a funny without being made a straight 'comic' character (if you pardon the oxymoron in those words). Reis and Chuen-Hua are both good looking and pretty funny in their various roles and it adds a romantic thread to the film that it benefits from. The leader is pretty good but the main bad guy was a bit hammy and looked too weird to really be the cunning insider that the plot would have us believe he was. Everyone is OK but whenever Mother Fong is absent for any length of time it is very telling. Overall this is a fun and silly film that will give some laughs intentionally and unintentionally. Those who enjoyed the first film will notice that this is weaker in several regards, but generally it delivers enough to be worth mentioning in the same breath. The cast try hard but the material isn't there often enough to back them � happily Li is always a good presence and Siao is a force in regards comedy and action.",
         "This is an excellent sequel to one of Jet Li's best films, and while it's not as good I still loved it, the fight scenes and performances are fantastic!. All the characters are great! and the story is really cool, plus Jet Li is simply amazing in this!. The fight choreography is phenomenal, and all the characters are extremely likable! plus I thought the finale was especially awesome. It had some pretty cool flashbacks, and it had some great comedy in it too, plus Jet had excellent chemistry with Josephine Siao!. The whole love triangle was amusing, however the villain in this is just plain annoying and is nowhere near as good as the one in the 1st, plus while the fight scenes are fantastic, they can't match the 1st in that department either!. The finale does get quite intense, and the ending is really amusing, however Fong's father absence is clearly felt as he had a great character in the 1st!. It's also a bit more serious then the 1st and as I said it lacks a good villain, however Jet and Josephine Siao carry this and make it a highly enjoyable sequel to one of Jet's best films!, and while it's not as good as the 1st I still loved it, the fight scenes and performances are fantastic, and I say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is awesome. Corey Yuen does an awesome job here with great camera work, cool angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is excellent. Jet Li is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, hilarious kicks that ass, had wonderful chemistry with Josephine Siao, had a great smile, and used the same formula that made his character so lovable in the 1st! (Jet Rules!!!!!). Josephine Siao is wonderful as Fong's mother she also used the great formula that mad her so hilarious in the 1st, and it also helped that her dubbing was better then usual I loved her!. Michelle Reis and Amy Kwok are great as the love interests and do what they have to do well. The Main bad guy is way too annoying and hammy to be that menacing, and really brought the film down. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see for everyone!. ****1/2 out of 5",
         "Out of the recent Jet Li films I have saw like Cradle 2 the Grave and Black Mask *Jet Li - The Legend II* is one of the best ones I have come across. If you enjoyed the action in Last Hero in China or Twin Warriors I think you will have a great time with this film. This film is more darker than the original, which works for the best I think. Most of the humour is very well done and I really enjoyed it. The story is above average as well which is a bonus with Kung-Fu films. The action scenes are done very well and look great. One scene in particular at the end when Fong Sai Yuk is walking down a street to rescue his mother and is confronted by several men looks great and the slow motion build-up to the beginning is excellent.",
         "Not as good as Fong Sai Yuk, the first, but definitely has great fighting scenes worth watching. This is some of the best HK cinema there is...best worldwide, even. The scenes will get you revved...and Jet Li is the best. More story here than in most HK movies!",
         "Fong Sai Yuk 2 directly continues the story of the first film, but tries to take a slightly more serious approach to the real historical characters it portrays. As a result, it has a darker feel than the original. Nevertheless, it contains numerous very funny comedy sequences, as our hero has two girls fighting over him and his doting mother on his tail. The fight sequences are not as well staged, however.",
         "The mandarin edition is the elite edition, it has a sub titles, but any one who can feel the emotions of the film, can over see over the sub titles with no problem. The voices from the mandarin edition are important just like the SOUNDTRACK and the original script. I first sore this great film when I was 13 and im now 19. I sore the mandarin edition on the channel 4 TV and managed to get it on video with a few minutes missing. I tried very hard to get hold of a copy of the film, but with no luck. To day while checking the local video rental store, I found The Legend 2 `Also known as Fong Shi Yung or Fong Sai Yong'. With delight I rented it thinking of the English edition of the same film I had enjoyed many times. A few hours later I watched the film, with disgust as it was an American dubbed voice, with no feeling or matching of the characters. To make matters worst the script was terrible, nothing of the same script as the mandarin edition, which was funny, interesting and meaningful. This edition was like as episode of an American TV show attempting to mimic a successful film, it was like watching a cheap meaning less film on sky TV which had not been successful enough in America to be tried any where in the world. The original oriental feel which inspired me so much was ruined if I call it that, it was not there it was cold, meaning less and plain TERRIBLE. The soundtrack, which helped give the film, its graceful rhythm was cheap and badly done, making it sound like an episode of the power rangers, IT WAS TERRIBLE. When people want films from other countries, they want them as they are shown in the country it was made for, with sub titles or good audio dubbing with correct feels, with the correct soundtrack and if they cart do that they should leave sub titles and not mess it up. The film is nearly 10 years old and is only just coming to some of the world. Many people have been waiting to be able to buy this film, this cheap edition film I sore was terrible, meaning, less, and some thing which would never even touch Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon if it had a stick as big as the Titanic in length. I was so bored by the new script that I turned it off, even though I tried very hard to sit to the end to see if the film was even possibly enjoyable I ended up with at least 40mins till the end. End result, TERRIBLE and nothing of the good stuff the film was striped from. Rest In Peace�",
         "Jet Li, more visible from Lethal Weapon, 4 returns as the hero of the Fong Sai Yuk movies. This one is darker and more serious than the first yet is just as enjoyable.",
         "Review: After watching the first movie, which I really didn't like, I thought that I would give this film a chance to see were the director took this terrible concept. I'm glad that the director chose to bring back Fong Sai Yuk's mum, but he still stuck to the comedy element which was more silly than funny. It does get a bit serious towards the end, when his mums life is threatened by the baddies, but the storyline  seemed a bit pointless. Once again, people were fighting for every and any reason and the ridiculous choreography was so unrealistic. Personally I think the mum saved the day and the speed which Jet Li fights is second to none, but on the whole, the film really isn't my cup of tea. Disappointing!  Round-Up: After reading reviews about this film, it seems like most people really enjoyed it, but I can't see why. You've got this two girls fighting over Jet Li, in the most childish way, and you've got this man with the most ridiculous laugh, battling with Jet Li just to prove that he is better than him. I just hope that the next Jet Li movie is better than these two because I was expecting much better. Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: HK$23million I recommend this movie to people who are into their Jet Li movies about a man trying to find out who is the traitor amongst the Red Flower Society. 2/10"
