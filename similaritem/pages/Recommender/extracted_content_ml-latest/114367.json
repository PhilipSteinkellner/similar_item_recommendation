The lead Tino Struckmann did a fantastic job leading this film, a great supporting cast, some well known faces compliments Struckmann's performance. But Struckmann belongs in great studio films to really shine and when Hollywood gets a look at him, I know he will get a chance to be a great star.\r\nGreat movie, if you are a war film fan you must see.",

As the Western Allies and the Russian Red Army make their advance toward Berlin, a British Army Officer attached to the Red Army discovers a secret that can shatter the unity of the Allies. Seized by Stalin's dreaded Intelligence Service, he finds unexpected help from an enemy and fellow prisoner, a German Captain. A common bond binds the two Officers by honor, oath and secrets. Joined by Anna, a beautiful Polish nurse cast adrift in the tides of war, the three are pursued by a ruthless Russian Intelligence Officer intent on preventing them from reaching Allied Command with their secret that could change the course of the war and the fate of millions. Brother's War was co-written by Warren Lewis (Black Rain, The 13th Warrior), with an impressive score from veteran composer Christopher Ward (Pearl Harbor, Speed). [D-Man2010] Filmmaker Jake Rademacher sets out to understand the experience, sacrifice, and motivation of his two brothers serving in Iraq, risking everything--including his life--to tell his brothers' story. Jake embeds with four combat units in Iraq and is given unprecedented access to U.S. and Iraqi combat units that takes him behind the camouflage curtain with secret reconnaissance troops on the Syrian border, into sniper \"Hide Sites\" in the Sunni Triangle, through raging machine gun battles with the Iraqi Army. He also follows his brothers home where separations and life-threatening work ripple through their parents, siblings, wives and children. [D-Man2010]",

         "I began to feel embarrassed for another person (the director/producers) while watching this movie. Probably one of the worst feelings out there. Embarrassed, that is, until I discovered the title similarity to \"Brothers at War\" (also 2009) which made me realize the director/producers are simply trying to make money off of people grabbing this \"movie\" by mistake. This really put the low budget situation in a different light. Utter waste of time. I paid $1 for a rental and feel overcharged. How can I say it again? I'll try....The electricity to run your TV/DVD player would be better spent running a washing machine. To the actors: not really your fault",
         "If you are an American movie producer, director or scriptwriter, and you want to put a believable war story on film, you should observe a few ground rules: 1.) Find a reputable war story, that interest's and intrigues you. Do not make a story up, or select events and clump them together, if they are too remotely related. 2.) Have a few Veterans or Survivors consulted and included in the extras of the DVD, from all sides. Hurry up, they will not be around forever. 3.) Read the History part, try to be as authentic as possible. 4.) Read about soldiers from the other side, try to get their characters and culture right. The Russians in this film look like morons and goons, the director should have watched some Russian war flicks like 'ZVESDA', 'SVOY' or 'KONVOY PQ-17', to get the feeling. 5.) Have military advisers around, to make sense out of the action scenes. At least this movie had some original vehicles like the Hetzer. But they seemed to be lost on the Battlefield. 6.) Get actors, that act like soldiers act in wars. Do not make the mistake of assigning pretty actors to one side, and the most ugly ones to the other. Do not dehumanize any side. Criticize them by their deeds, do not paint them as subhumans. 7.) Do not make a war movie, that subjects to your ideology. This one felt like a typical propaganda movie. A very naive and born out of prejudiced klishe'. 8.) A good musical score, this was the only part in the movie, that was done good.",
         "This flick was terrible,wooden acting ,cheesy + it shows so much that it is an zero budget C-film..I love WW2 films..I tought I would enjoy this movie,I knew it wouldn't be in the calibre as say Enemy of the gates or Saving private Ryan etc but nope...they should have hired a decent military adviser and got the details right(even if that is not THAT important if the story is good and it sucks you in from the beginning,which it failed to do here).. But that even more draws attention to the flawed script and cheesy action sequences,it looked like a bad film student film at the worst,and a really good one at the best..some of the action was over the top and seemingly copied from some 30 year old John Wayne movie,NO realism whatsoever(THE ALLIES CANT FIND OUT OUR EVIL PLAN MUHAHAHAHA!)I mean come on! the British guy talked with a horrible phony accent,I could keep on listing things but I digress. To the makers: You shoud have tried harder,much harder,taken your time with the script and not relied on predictable clichés..and tried to actually research the subject matter.. Are you on some personal quest to be the new Uwe Boll?",
         "I have seen this movie twice! Just felt i had to start on a positive note since most of the reviews are bad ones;) This movie is a cheap production. Thats a fact. In many of the scenes I get the feeling that I'm watching a bunch of ww2 buff's that play war. but then the movie also has some decent battle scenes considering the budget. I haven't seen any major errors in Equipment (yes there might be some wrong tanks and a American flag from the fifties). however all the medals and uniforms are correct. the Russian cannon and handguns being used by the Germans are not prop-fails, they are very realistic as German soldiers at that time used everything they could to keep the Russians away. I have read some books written by Soldiers on the eastern front and the tactics being used are also relatively realistic.(some of them, indeed there are mistakes) There was a complaint that the Germans yelled panzer when the tanks appeared. That is exactly what they would have said. It IS the German word for tank. Or maybe the Germans built the pak.40(antitank cannon4.40) to take out their own tanks?;) Also, don't complain that the Russian are portrayed as subhuman assholes, most of the Hollywood movies I have seen does the same thing. Russians are off course just like everyone else but it is just natural that the Grunts of the red army looked a little ugly and weird. They had been at war for a long time, fighting a very resilient enemy. Now i don't like Nazis but I have a deep respect for the common Whermacht soldier. many of them where forced to war and in the end, they just fought for their own lives. even the SS wasn't all bad, many of them simply needed a job in the 30's or joined up to fight communism. The German soldier was just like every soldier in a major war. Afraid. Few of them where politically active and most companies would get a political officer that all the soldiers hated. most of us know that it is worse to have a bad boss than to work in his competition, so lets give the common German soldier of ww2 a break:) I didn't read all the reviews, so maybe all this have been said before. I don't care. I like this movie. just get past the fact that it is far below the budget of most war films, and one might find that the movie is good. There are times when the story feels choppy, but again it has a very low budget so I suppose parts could have been cut. I'll give it a 6 out of 10. could have been much better, but all in all, it's cool.",
         "Okay I WAS going to start by saying this movie is simply atrocious BUT now I have had the pleasure of reading Hugh Daly's comments (please read them for yourself) my opinion has changed. I admit that I am guilty of armchair directing and picking holes in movies - I often comment that the movie must have cost a fortune to produce so why did they not realize how bad it was? Well, Hugh Daly has let us know that not all movies have huge budgets and when you bear this in mind, things come into perspective. The actual premise of the movie is an interesting one and I rather liked the pairing of the British guy and the main German guy. I did not find Hugh's acting that wooden, and the German lead's acting was great throughout. I am left wondering if German soldiers would refer to oncoming Russian tanks as \"Panzers\" - maybe this is a generic German term for \"tank\"? Of course I am only used to referring to German tanks as Panzers, but what do I know anyway? The uniforms, vehicles and similar things are very well done - the producers are to be commended. However trying to rate a movie of this type when it has had to deal with budget restraints is difficult. We all know that SPR and BOB were brilliant efforts and they have set the bar. Does this mean that we cannot forgive other war movies that try to tell a story with less resources? Hugh Daly, I salute you and want you to know that it is refreshing to read feedback directly from the source! Go into watching this movie with an open mind, knowing that it is NOT to be compared to the Spielberg efforts. You might like some or all of it.",
         "Plus of this film: Good Music and the ending credits Negative: everything else, God don't waste your time The lead actors were all just terrible ,supporting actors were OK but who watches a movie for supporting actors. At first I was really mad at everyone who worked on this POS until I saw the credits. Than it all came together. The people responsible for stealing 2 hours of my life were apparently the two leads ,since they were the ones who wrote the story, produced and executive produced this piece of tripe A lesson for every actor out there. If your so bad at acting that no one will cast you and you have to write and fund your own movie maybe you need to find a new line of work. If I could change one thing about this movie I would put a disclaimer on the front of the box warning audiences that narcissistic crap is to follow So to the actor with the fake British accent and tony the German lead, guys I want my $1 back.",
         "Where do I even begin? The plot jumps from character to character without any explanation of what is happening in the background. The \"German\" soldiers are 100% American, and do not even attempt a German accent. the main British soldiers also switch in and out of fake British accents. The main German characters are using Russian issued weapons. When people get shot,miraculously, they do not bleed. In fact, when most weapons are shot, you can tell that the sound and flash were added afterward, and the actors are just faking the kick. Some of the super-close up shots are filmed with blanks, but the majority of it is CGI. 2 men will hide behind a tree as big as my leg, and fight off an entire platoon...magically, there are no bullet holes in the tree. As far as acting goes, it goes from bad to worse as soon as the first scene is over. I love corny movies and bad acting, but it gets to a point where it's just too bad for words. I watched 3 chapters of this movie, and couldn't take it...I skipped forward to each chapter and tried to watch a little bit of each one,but it just kept getting worse. PLEASE do not waste your time!!!!",
         "A few poster seems to have problems that at the beginning of the film some Germans are using Russian weapons, and Russian use German tanks. One even made a comment about the Germans call it a panzer. And for this call it an unrealistic militarily and a joke. Well... About the history, plot, characters performance, etc, I leave for others to judge. But a simple note regarding uses of weapon. 1. It's a well know fact, that the Germans and Russians used each others weapon during the WWII. Especially at the end of the war it become more and more usual. Both the Finish and Germans repainted the Russian tanks and used them. Just as the Russians repainted captured German tanks, etc... For you non belivers regarding this, I suggest you take a visit to a WWII museum in Finland or even better the fantastic tank museum outside Moscow, Russia... Enough said! 2. What's so funny that the Germans calls a tank a panzer? Panzer happens to be the German word for a tank. Panzer Division, etc. So claiming this movie is historical wrong, well yes it have it's flaws. But does it claim to be based on true story or actually events? Even the sun have it's dark spots, and movies like Enemy at the Gates and Saving Private Ryan that some praise, are surely more fiction then facts just as well, and they surely have their own flaws. But who cares, they are both damn good movies. For you WWII fanatics I recommend the movie \"Talvisota\" (possible buy with English subtitle).",
         "I am disgusted by the negative reviews. I enjoy watching WW2 films and there are not that many new ones being produced, so we should congratulate Tino Struckmann, who also plays the main German, for making films about this genre. Obviously, they are on a tight budget, but not everyone has Spielberg's millions and access to major Hollywood capital. Giving ratings like 2 out of 10 means that other small budget films about WW2 are unlikely to be attempted which would be a tremendous loss. They have done their best with the resources available and if you don't like it, please only watch Hollywood blockbusters again with famous stars whose individual salary demands will be more than all the money paid to the whole cast of this.",
         "Let me agree that this movie is, as claimed, \"based on real events\". As in, there was in fact a Second World War, and there was fighting in Poland. Beyond that, I'm not sure that this movie is based on anything. Many reviewers have pointed out numerous mistakes in uniform, tactics, arms, and the like. I will add to that the fact that the British officer who becomes part of the main story group raises not a single eyebrow when they enter the German formation in the truck and decide to 'help the wounded'. What could have and should have been a taut cat and mouse game of deception turns into yet another farce, joining the incredible stereotypes overplayed foppishly throughout the movie. Virtually all the Russians are portrayed as cruel, arrogant, incompetent and/or drunk. The Gestapo are like caricatures from Hogan's Heroes, except we are meant to take them seriously. Anyone looking for a good World War 2 movie about the undercovered battles in Poland during the Nazi retreat will be disappointed by this film. It's only real value is that it addresses a seldom seen aspect of the war; it's too bad that it does it so poorly."

The western Allies push into Germany and the Red Army fights its way towards Berlin. Churchill is worried about Russia's post-war plans for Europe but must not endanger the increasingly threatened alliance between the west and Russia. A British military officer attached to the Red Army discovers a Russian war crime against the Polish government in exile and is seized by Stalin's feared intelligence service. He finds unexpected help from an enemy and fellow prisoner, a German Captain. They discover a common bond in Freemasonry and are bound by honor, oath and secrets. They are joined by Anna, a beautiful Polish nurse cast adrift on the tides of war. The three are pursued by A ruthless Russian commander through Germany carrying a secret that can change the outcome of the world and the fate of millions. Brother's War was produced with strict attention to historic accuracy and military detail and portrays the horrors and heroism of desperate battles. The film also opens the door into the ancient order of Freemasons and presents unmatched insight on the real histories of these men, brothers all, who have fought in every war for hundreds of years."],
