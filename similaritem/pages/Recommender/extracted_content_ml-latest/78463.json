         "This is a great movie, with strong performances from all of its stars. Spencer Tracy is great as a manipulative bum who is capable of doing some pretty low things at times, but can actually be repentant and likeable at other times. John Garfield is also good as another bum who gets a break only to be walked all over by Tracy's character. And Frank Morgan is very memorable as a mysterious hermit dog lover who Tracy tries to decipher for selfish reasons. And it's here that Hedy Lamarr proves conclusively that she wasn't reliant on glamor, as she gives a great performance as a poor Portuguese girl with slightly untidy hair, inexpensive clothing, and nominal makeup. And she looks as gorgeous as ever despite all that! This movie was the last serious effort MGM made to get Hedy Lamarr a good role in a good movie and make a bigger star of her. Unfortunately, bad timing (the U.S. having recently been forced into WWII) caused a lack of public interest in this film when it was released, and MGM rapidly lost interest in her from that point on. She went on to make only five more films for MGM, and while most of them are decent and entertaining enough, none are truly excellent. Too bad. She was wonderful!",
         "\"Tortilla Flat\" is a good movie. In some ways, it reminds me of \"Juarez,\" another film in which John Garfield plays a Latino. The similarity is that both are good films that have contained within them really terrific scenes. I guess you could say that in these films, the parts are in some ways greater than the whole. For me, the best scenes in \"Tortilla Flat\" revolve around Frank Morgan, who plays a sort of tramp (homeless man) who goes around with a bunch of dogs. Like Mr. Morgan, one of the dogs seems to have appeared in \"The Wizard of Oz\" -- yes, I think Toto is in \"Tortilla Flat.\" Not surprising, since both films were directed by Victor Fleming. But the most extraordinary scene is that in which Frank Morgan has gathered his five dogs, in the midst of the majestic Redwood Forest, and relates to the dogs the story of St. Francis. As he is telling the story, the dogs actually have a vision! As the vision hovers, and the dogs react, Morgan averts his eyes. When the vision passes, Morgan shouts to the dogs: \"Did you see him? Did you see him? It was St. Francis! What good boys you must be to see St. Francis!\" I know of few other films that depict pure religious experience so effectively. It raises this good film onto another level.",
         "I grew up in Monterey and I vividly remember my father speaking of these characters when he was growing up. Steinbeck sought to place these men in a motif that was similar to that of the knights of the Round Table showing all their excesses, loves, and loyalty to each other. While the film shows 1940's insensitivities it also captures a great deal of Steinbeck's purposes. It might be helpful to remember that Steinbeck wasn't writing of chicano's or even Mexicans per se, but of the creollo or Californio, i.e. the Spanish and later Mexican vaquero who ruled and reigned in Californio long before the Mexican national arrived in California.",
         "Okay yes, Spencer Tracy does NOT look like a Paisano, but his performance in this movie is pretty cool and worth noting. I absolutely loved the book and Spencer Tracy's portrayal of Pilon went above and beyond what I expected the character to turn out like on screen. Frank Morgan was wonderful too. The scenes with the songs are particularly charming. The story is about homeless men who live life one day at a time. Their biggest concern of each day is how they're going to acquire wine. Their friend Danny inherits two houses and Pilon is concerned that this newfound wealth is affecting their friendship. Along the way they bring in more roommates including the wonderful Pirate character and the guys get into some shenanigans involving what else? Money, women and wine. I also very much adored the simplicity of Victor Fleming's direction. He made a lot of beautiful shots, especially of the Pirate's adorable dogs!",
         "If you like comedies the whole family can see and enjoy. This is a movie for you. But it is more than a good comedy of life an wonderful characters in a poor Mexican community in Monterry California. First is the most improbable casting that worked so well. I can picture Spencer Tracy cast as most any character except for a Mexican passion, wise in somethings and dumb -- plain foolish -- in others. He managed the role wonderfully. Hedy Lamar -- a peasant girl looking for a man with a job who could make her a work at home mom with many babies. She pulled it off with a sizzle. Most of all it was a very thought provoking movie. If followed the ideas of the famous book by John Stienbeck most accurately. Showing how we tend to get into ruts in life and using the wonderful Northern California landscape to show some overlooked opportunities to live well. If you want to really get into this movie read the book first.",
         "Greatly enjoyed this story written by John Steinbeck and a great cast of veteran actors who all gave outstanding performances. Daniel Alvarez, (John Garfield) is a poor young man who pals around with a bunch of lazy men who never seem to work and love to eat and drink wine. Daniel inherits two homes that his grandfather left him and one of his friends, Pilon, (Spencer Tracy) decides to take advantage of him and brings in all his friends to live in one of the houses. There is a great deal of trying to steal chickens and also obtaining free wine from local female ladies. Daniel meets up with a very pretty woman named Dolores Ramirez, (Hedy Lamarr) and they both become very good friends and lovers. There is also a man named The Pirate, (Frank Morgan) who lives like a tramp, but has plenty of money hidden in the woods. The Pirate is trying to save money to buy a silver golden stick for the Statue of St. Franicis in the local Catholic Church. Pilon wants to steal this money from the Pirate and then he starts experiencing different changes in his personality which creates a great ending to this story. Enjoy.",
         "I've been reading some of the negatives of some of the reviewers here about the authenticity of the actors involved. Its only a movie and brought out by a studio that had to use their top actors that were available at the time. It goes way back to the early 30's on how actors were used for certain roles. Recall Edward G. Robinson a Jew, as Rico an Italian mobster, Paul Muni another Jew, as a Mexican, Meryl Streep, Polish as an Italian and etc. and etc. If this bothers you, then don't go to the movies. Its called \"make believe\"...remember? Most commend Frank Morgan's role here as a big highlight for his performance, but he was definitely not a Mexican. But the only ones that I thought pulled it off was Akin Tamiroff and Hedy Lamarr...maybe because they actually have accents..and speaking of Hedy, she looked terrific as usual and was very sexy. Somehow I wished Cecil B. DeMille made \"Samson & Delilah\" then. Worth to watch this movie for her alone.",
         "I find it difficult to believe that this picture is not remembered more fondly by film critics and historians. I went into this film expecting nothing more than a few chuckles and a few yawns. I was wrong! This picture should be remembered in the same light as other great comedies of the 1940's such as THE LADY EVE, ARSENIC AND OLD LACE, and THE BANK DICK.",
         "This movie is full of surprises, not the least is the casting. (Was that \"Toto\" as \"one of the boys\"?) So many of the cast are in our movie memory banks. It's a well-acted, well-scripted film that can be enjoyed by the whole family.",
         "\"Tortilla flat\" (1942) directed by Victor Fleming is of course a very good movie for now, instead maybe the novel itself where it came from a John Steinbeck's own tale, because many aspects of the structure of the allegedly poor's society. Where it was necessary fifteen dollars for the location of the flat of a given heir, whose notification by a barrister is made in jail and after, by this path, good fellows coming up helping him, but by lack of chance the flat is burned by accident. The wealthy of work surplus in income to the exploitation not retributed is lost, if the couple not insures their own lives and instead allows that for the free moments with such a kind of job to save them as too characters. Still as though themselves were either inside a struggle, for also developing by this way the community. Where they are inserted like two human beings, but far away from the misery of the beginning of their natural instincts, not possible otherwise for surviving alone if without the help of friendship circumstances. Victor Fleming in this movie made an unforgettable artistic view of the so-called half citizenship, at the time with their believers, dogs and a young lady whose charming revolt attracts these poor individuals, near the industrialism of the outskirts of a small town, from West coast in America, while beginning a decade before during the Depression times. The photography of this movie was made by Karl Freund and it is quite typical expressionist, mingled with realistic aspirations as when we saw the rays of a sunny day, inside a forest nearby the town. Where the old mendicant is living with five different - abandoned, but domesticated - dogs, it is inspired too by the resurrection of a new standard of living with his great amount of coins. By whom we had suddenly the vision of a kind of natural phenomena, that put suddenly the dogs as protagonists standing up, as if all it were believing in a kind of apparition such in likely one vision of the almighty of the animals, as it was for them such as unlikely a naturalistic influence of exterior divine maturity. It's interesting watch how the character of John Garfield in a brawl on the factory got the hand of Heddy Lamarr and decidedly both joint their belonguing's for a new life, after the whole of disputing each other but honoring friends with a private ceremony."
