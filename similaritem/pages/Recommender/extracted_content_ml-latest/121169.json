         "Describing this film as exploring the sado-masochistic relationship of two lesbian entomologists in Eastern Europe almost makes it sound like a parody of an art-film, and film critics are going to be falling over themselves to show off how many influences they can recognise. It's not too heavy though; the only time it was too blatant was when Strickland recreates Brakhage's Mothlight. A lot of the time it does feel like Strickland is winking at the audience, though he saves the most obvious gags for the credits, often feeling like he's pastiching lesbian fetishism and 70s arcadian European films. On the one hand this is a strength of the film in that it lightens the mood and entertains, but I do feel as though it stopped the film from entirely drawing me in. The core of the film that examines the relationship is romantic, sweet and moving: about growing old and the demands lovers put on each other in a relationship. For a film about S&M it was a lot less explicit than I thought it would be: there's no nudity and the sex is all obscured or off-screen. The metaphorical parallels were less successful: the moths and entomology never truly feel like a successful metaphor or that they sufficiently enhance the story to justify the attention paid to them. It is an interesting and beautiful film and well worth your time.",
         "Forget 9 1/2 Weeks, forget Last Tango in Paris, forget Secretary and most definitely forget 50 Shades, this is THE definitive cinematic essay on a dom/sub relationship. The idea is a fascinating and brave one: to create an homage to artistic elements of the \"disreputable\" sexploitation movies of the 1970s and make it beautiful and profound. It's another movie that full of references to other movies and to the movie-making process. I recognised only little hints of Just Jaekin, being unfamiliar with the other influences. I did spot the marker tape on the carpet that serve two purposes, practical and metaphorical. Er.. three, there are two metaphors going on, I think, one plot-related and one post- modern commentary. Talking of plot, it is so slight that it could be explained in three sentences. I won't, obviously, but honestly it wouldn't matter if I did. What matters is the manner of the telling. The story inhabits a strange dream-like space where everyone in the town is a fetishistic female entomologist! (If anyone can explain the significance of the entomology, please do, I'm all ears!) But within the unreal external world, the two heroines inhabit an emotional world that is utterly believable. In sumptuous but slightly muted autumn colours, the film looks gorgeous. I found it sensual, very erotic (despite there being no more than a few seconds of anything you could call \"sex\" and no nudity at all), emotionally engaging, warm, sad, funny and REAL. Although the story deals exclusively with dominance and submission (no trace of S&M despite what it says in all the publicity, including in interviews with the director) it is a universal story about conflicting desires, fantasies, trust and compromise. In some way, it is a story for every relationship. I absolutely loved this film.",
         "Peter Strickland is a film maker who likes to do things differently � his last feature 'Berberian Sound Studio' will mean you will never look at a vegetable the same way again. Here he takes on the theme of a sadomasochistic, lesbian relationship to examine how we all depend on each other and the inter dependencies that can occur to make relationships work. At the heart are two lovers Cynthia and Evelyn who seem to be in a very one sided relationship � one being mistress and one being badly used servant. They are also both entomologists and give talks on moths and butterflies � the title 'The Duke of Burgundy' is an actual butterfly orange and brown in colour and found in Europe and mostly Southern Britain. The moths also act as a metaphor in the case of being 'drawn to a flame' scenario; but also the many butterflies pinned and mounted that occur throughout the film reflect the love/abuse relationship in that the very beauty that attracts some people cause them to act in cruel way to the object of desire. This is not 'Fifty Shades of Grey' the sex is all tastefully done off screen. It is also exceptionally beautifully filmed � in Hungary as it turns out. The attention to style and miniscule details is almost obsessive and worth every effort in terms of rewards for the viewer. It is though about relationships and what we will do for each other � even if it goes against our own particular grain. This is a film for those who appreciate art-house but like it to have one foot in realism (at least) and as such is one I both enjoyed and can easily recommend.",
         "Cynthia (Sidse Babett Knudsen) is a middle-aged woman, a professor who studies butterflies and moths. She lives in an opulent house full of books and insects, we do not know where she lives or in what time but its safe to assume its in the 1970's. Her life revolves around regular visits to the library, seminars about butterflies and moths, and causing as much pain to her maid as possible. The younger Evelyn (Chiara D'Anna) works as the maid, and Cynthia finds any excuse to find fault in Evelyn's work. But we soon learn that Evelyn is the dominant half of this relationship, who demands that Cynthia performs in an elaborate erotic game of her choosing. But what was once daring and sexually charged, becomes stifling for both who soon lose patience. Not even some bespoke erotic furniture can mask the problems in their fragile relationship. Peter Strickland's last film 'The Barbarian Sound Studio' was a homage to Italian horror films of the 70's, and 'The Duke of Burgundy' does the same for the European Erotica films from the same era. Its often a very funny film, including cinematic firsts in the credits for a Human toilet consultant and Perfumes by Je Suis Gizelle! 'The Duke Of Burgundy' may be an acquired taste to some, it's a beautifully shot film. It's a curious study of an unusual love affair with universal connections, aided by two fine performances from Knudsen and D'Anna who show a great deal of restraint. A lot of questions about their relationship go unanswered, but its not to the films detriment. 'The Duke of Burgundy' is a kinky, hallucinatory gem from a unique director.",
         "This is a profound and engrossing film. Peter Strickland is clearly less a fan of cinema than a fanatic for film and there is a difference. He believes that film does not depict reality but is a reproduction of reality and therein lies his fascination. He is excited by this process and through his films similarly excites us. In this film, ostensibly about a couple of ladies living out a BDSM relationship in a rambling old mansion, his filmic inspiration is Stan Brakhage. Brakhage, who died only a few years back. experimented with film all his life, and was introduced to me many, many years ago as I sat in a mattress strewn room, four floors up in an otherwise derelict building in Camden. One of Brakhage's early films was Mothlight (1963) and was made without the use of a camera, by pressing the wings of moths into the negative that was then projected giving and unworldly effect that was not unlike staring at a light surrounded by fluttering moths. Strickland replicates this wonderfully in a sensational dream sequence in his film and is the reason for the insects featuring so prominently. As in his previous films, Strickland is as fascinated with sound as much as picture and here the soundtrack is punctuated with the scratchings and flutterings of butterflies and moths, the purring of the cat and a madam snoring. With so many visual and aural treats we sometimes tend to lose focus on the two ladies but are soon brought back by another twist in the tale. On the face of it this tale of a dom and a sub should be simple enough to tell but the director takes his time to establish the exact tone he wants so we can accept as 'true' what we see before us, even as it changes before our very eyes. As you may have gathered from my rambling, this is no ordinary film and the expected, bare flesh and lashings do not appear but plenty more does, more or less on screen, including the 'human toilet' and a fantastic masturbatory sequence with verbal instructions. So, to conclude, for me Strickland has done it again, a wonderful film, almost out of nothing as he allows his love of 'this unexplored corner of cinema that is still seen as disreputable' (principally, giallo and sexploitation) to colour his vision (and sound) for our delight.",
         "The Duke of Burgundy is a 2014 British drama film written and directed by Peter Strickland. Evelyn is studying lepidopterology under the older Cynthia, who frequently lectures on her studies. Evelyn is romantically involved with Cynthia and works as a maid in her home, where she is subject to strict behavioral expectations and high standards for cleanliness. When Evelyn does not complete tasks to Cynthia's satisfaction, she is punished. As Cynthia increasingly falters in her dominance, it becomes apparent that Evelyn is orchestrating Cynthia's role in the relationship by writing instructions and scripts for specific scenes, which the couple acts out in the same way each day. While Evelyn finds the scenes to be sexually exciting, Cynthia only acts them out to sate her lover. She attempts to please Evelyn by ordering a carpenter to construct a bed with a drawer underneath for Evelyn to sleep in as a punishment; however, Evelyn is unhappy with the length of time it will take to produce the bed, and ultimately refuses the gift. Evelyn begins to demand that Cynthia lock her in a trunk in the evening as a new punishment. Cynthia agrees, but she is resentful about the new physical separation. Cynthia also becomes self- conscious about her aging, having injured her back moving the trunk to her bedside. She expresses her unhappiness on Evelyn's birthday, when she demands that Evelyn bake her own birthday cake, which she eats while reclining with her feet resting on Evelyn's face. Evelyn does not enjoy the scene and calls out her safe word, which Cynthia ignores. The couple's relationship becomes more strained as Evelyn's expectations go unfulfilled. Finally, Cynthia accuses Evelyn of polishing another lecturer's boots, which she considers to be an act of betrayal. The two eventually seem to make up, and Evelyn agrees to put less emphasis on her sexual deviances. However, at the end of the film, the couple is seen going through the same play routine seen at the film's start.",
         "Fantastic cinematography, an excellent score, and two lead actresses who play their parts with great depth of feeling. This is a love story, it studies the interaction of two lovers in a submission/dominant relationship, and how the nature of the relationship tests the bonds of love, beneath the acts of domination and submission. BDSM relationship are controlled by the submissive, and clearly this is the case in the film, and I trust is something that come through clearly. Whether spotted by the audience is another matter, but it is beautifully portrayed here. From the demands of how to be treated, to the repetition of the BDSM scenes, kt is clear the submissive is driving the agenda. The way in which this begins to test the bonds the dominant feels is brilliantly portrayed. It is difficult to define love, and the film explores how the human bond that is love is something much deeper than the acts of love, and certainly the acts of sex, be they \"vanilla' or otherwise. A future classic, and something that puts 50 shades of Grey into 50 shades pale...",
         "BERBERIAN SOUND STUDIO, is centred on a British sound engineer Gilderoy (Jones), who previously works on projects such as pastoral documents, arrives in Italy to work in a new project from Italian director Giancarlo Santini (Mancino) in the titular studio, which he has no idea is a spooky giallo about witches, anyway he stays and engages in working with the obnoxious producer Francesco (Fusco), but due to the barrier of language and the rude behaviour received from his new colleagues, Gilderoy is incapable of blending in with the team and begins to question his professional competence, hallucinations and dreamlike sequences ensue, what is the real deal to bring him to the studio? Is he one of the characters in the giallo flick or an unwitting guinea pig of a bigger but secret project? Everything will end in a befuddling concussion and here is my main gripe, it is a 93-minutes film, stuffed with minute details towards the omnipresence of sound (both lifeless objects and human voice including screaming and post-dub process), and striking shots of various apparatus and items (mainly vegetables) used to create specific sound in a claustrophobic working environment, lumbers drearily until the last 15 minutes or so (the most banal part is the stereotyped depiction of the Italian crew), the storyline finally begins to project an uncanny angle which piques curiosity, but as if Strickland doesn't have a clear train-of- thought of what has happened, the picture comes to a halt abruptly, provokes the frustration due to one's unquenched satisfaction mixed with a sense of deception, obviously something rotten is festering (other than the vegetables), but there are so little clues being offered for us to conjecture a plausible upshot. Fortuitously, this bitter taste will be massively dispelled in Strickland's latest project, THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY, a lesbian drama set in an ethereal world with no men in sight (yes, no dukes or whatsoever, even a mannequin sitting among the audience during the academic symposium is female). Cynthia (Knudsen) is a lepidopterologist (a branch of entomology concerning the study of moths and butterflies), actually the film's title refers to a particular species of butterfly in UK. She lives in a quaint and baroque villa in an anonymous rural area with her younger lover Evelyn (D'Anna), probably her disciple. Due to Strickland's ingenious trickery, initially audience is ushered to a scenario of a two- play between Cynthia, a harsh mistress and her subservient maid Evelyn, the latter will be punished if she doesn't meet the former's strict demand. Later their real identity lays bare that the two are actual lovers, their double-imaged sex scenes embroider a layer of mystery into their devoted passion, and more shockingly, the punishment is implied to be urolagnia, which immediately explains why Cynthia is persistently shown drinking water before their role-play. So it is about BDSM, a lesbian variant of 50 SHADES OF GREY (2015)? Believe me, it's much better! The role definition is another twist here, the apparently dominant Cynthia, is really the passive one, all her act is wholesomely scripted by Evelyn in advance, who can only satisfy her libido by being put under some sort of punishment/humiliation, she dictates which line Cynthia should deliver, at what precise moment, which costume and wig she should wear during the occasion. Nevertheless, after the repetitious act, Cynthia grows tired of the game, and mainly because she doesn't enjoy it sexually, and meanwhile Evelyn becomes more and more difficult to be satisfied, since commitment is the key in role- playing, once Cynthia has a slip of mind in her role, a small chasm will inevitably engenders. After a futile effort to purchase a tailor-made bed or a human toilet (I cannot even imagine what it is), Evelyn's request escalates to be locked up in an antique chest with hands tied up for the night as a punishment she enjoys, their relationship is under severe strain, until a corny set piece of betrayal opportunely emerges (by cleaning other woman's boots). Meritoriously Strickland doesn't resort to hyperbole, he sticks to the eerie atmosphere, picturesque location, tonal device, to decipher Cynthia's incubus and Evelyn's controlling nature, butterflies and specimens are deployed with staggering beauty and the finale, a rotation to the beginning, is a hymn celebrating the delicate equilibrium between two lovers, love demands sacrifice, both parties can take one step back and strive to re-connect from the very start, that is a profound meditation on the nature of love, however cinematically contrived the story is, this end-note remarkably hits the bull's eye. Both films feature strong leading performances, Toby Jones in BSS, is an outsider awkwardly boxed up in a bizarrely sonic space, helplessly struggles to get a grip with his own sense while forcibly keeping the appearance of sobriety, and his stern look during a prolonged close-up is a defiant testimony of the perseverance from an unattractive character thespian, if the camera lingers on him longer, he can be an attention-grabber too. Danish actress Sidse Babett Knudsen, mostly known for Susanne Bier's Oscar-nominated foreign picture AFTER THE WEDDING (2006, 7/10) expresses in fluent English and lights up the screen with a sympathetic presentation of a woman plagued by her lover's gruelling quest to challenge the limbo of human lust. Italian actress Chiara D'Anna, also appears in BSS, not a knockout at first sight, but grows on you with her seductive manner of speaking and unyielding determination to delve into the darkest side of her sexual thrill. All in all, TDOB is a deliriously lurid fable with a swooning flagrancy, without a doubt Strickland's best work to date.",
         "Movies like this don't come around to often. From the opening credits to the beautiful set and excellent score, this is a film full of atmosphere and surrealism. For those of you who don't know what The Duke of Burgundy is, its a rare butterfly, and this film is definitely a rare specimen. It's beautifully tender, with the two excellent leads making a sub/dom relationship look pretty normal, being locked in a box, peed on or cleaning the house when told to would probably be considered a bit weird by most people, but this a story of love, passion, insecurities and relationships. It works on so many levels. There's lots to question; why are there no men in the village? Why are they all into butterflies? Who cares, its great and takes you to another world. One that will stay with you long after. The dream sequence is beautiful, only matched by the love making scenes in Under the Skin in my opinion. If you like works of art with substance, then this is for you. If you like films about power, greed, and capitalism then avoid this, its not for you",
         "This film is all about the very special dominance-and-submission (BDSM) relationship of two lesbians, one of them is an entomologist and the other is her domestic maid. There is little plot to even talk about; and at the end of the film, the couple is seen going through the same play routine as seen at the film's start. THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY is being introduced to the public as a sensual art- film, and so a lot of film critics are blabbering about how good it is and how many influences they recognize in it and all that stuff . . tss. OK maybe i don't get it . . . that's possible but i was misled by all the good reviews here on IMDb. With this review i want to give another view on the film: i find this movie not the least bit sensual or erotic, unemotional, funny and even hilarious in a ridiculous kind of way, utterly stupid, absurd, superficial, largely melodramatic and, last but not least: very, very, very boring!"
