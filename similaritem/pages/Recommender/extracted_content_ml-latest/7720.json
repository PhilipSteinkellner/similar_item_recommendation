      "synopsis": "(Sequel to The Three Musketeers) Porthos (Frank Finlay) recaps the events leading to D'Artagnan (Michael York) becoming a musketeer. The original trio, including Porthos' companions Aramis (Richard Chamberlain) and Athos (Oliver Reed) find themselves on a rescue mission behind enemy lines during the battle of La Rochelle. D'Artagnan's enemy Rochefort (Christopher Lee) was caught spying and is enduring a wait before an amateur firing squad learning to load their rifles on the job. While they figure out how to blindfold a condemned man who has only one eye, Athos and Aramis prepare to launch a smoke bomb as cover while Porthos brings the horses for their escape, but the fuse goes out just as the order is given to fire. Fortunately the entire firing squad misses their target, and while they reload the trio manages to extract the spy. He is returned to his master, Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston), then is sent to obtain D'Artagnan's lover Constance (Raquel Welsh). She is the dressmaker and confidante to Queen Anne (Geraldine Chapman) and a valued hostage if they are to deal with Anne's affair with the Protestant sympathizer, the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward). Rochefort and his men find D'Artagnan and Constance shopping in the public market. When she picks a melon from a basket, a hand appears from within and seizes her. While she is taken away, D'Artagnan engages his enemy in a duel and manages to deliver a slicing blow to Rochefort's hand; Rochefort upsets a cart of potatoes, which spills and buries D'Artagnan. He is rescued by the mysterious and beautiful spy Milady DeWinter (Faye Dunaway) and taken to her private home. He regains consciousness in her bedroom where she is attending him while attired in revealing lingerie, but despite her charms he departs hastily, promising to come back and \"thank her properly.\" When he leaves, Milady undresses and prepares to step into her bath, but recoils when she sees the water is tinged red. Rochefort was hiding there, letting his injured hand bleed into her bathwater. As they embrace, they agree to deal with D'Artagnan later. Back at the musketeers' training facility, D'Artagnan ponders his problems while Porthos demonstrates a new sword technique. He flings the sword from its scabbard to sail through the air and hit its mark. Aramis is unimpressed and shows him that the sword could easily be deflected, and they leave arguing the finer points of disarming oneself. An inebriated Athos appears to question D'Artagnan about his new lover. He replies the he loves Milady with his head and Constance with his heart. When asked if he has not ever lost his heart, Athos grows reflective and relates a love story about a man who, unlike him, did lose his heart. It becomes apparent that he is speaking of himself in his life before he became a musketeer. As a nobleman he was a man of honor who fell in love with a mysterious woman and married her, bestowing his title and wealth on her. One day when she fell from her horse, the garter she always wore on her upper arm slipped to reveal the brand of the fleur de lis, identifying her as a criminal. In that moment he lost his honor. Though he had throttled her in his anger, he never knew whether or not she had died. He warns D'Artagnan that such women cause trouble, and the young musketeer agrees that he should stay faithful to Constance. Still needing to repay his debt, D'Artagnan returns to Milady's home and is admitted by her attendant Kitty (Nicole Calfan). Her mistress is away and Kitty has her own interests, so they slip into her bedroom. When Milady returns, Kitty stalls for time and D'Artagnan overhears Milady talking to Kitty about Constance while donning her jewels for the evening; D'Artagnan slips out and re-enters by the front door to pay his proper visit to Milady in her bedroom. Afterward, he calmly asks her where she has taken Constance, and when he grabs her arm the garter there pulls away from a brand of the fleur de lis, and Milady produces two glass daggers filled with acid to attack him. He manages to grab his sword and hold her at bay while he leaves the bedroom, clad only in the sheet, and locks the door. Kitty hands him a cloak and he jumps out the window to escape, finding he has Milady's necklace in his hand. Kitty finally releases her mistress from the bedroom and endures her frustrated blows. Later at the bar, Porthos asks D'Artagnan for money and the necklace slips from his pocket. Athos recognizes it at once, confirming that his wife is still alive. D'Artagnan promises to keep it a secret from the others. Later he goes to the palace to see if the Queen can help find Constance, and is instead captured by the Cardinal's men and taken to his private office. Richelieu remarks upon D'Artagnan's continued good luck and offers friendship in return for the musketeer becoming one of his men, but D'Artagnan refuses and Richelieu warns him that his journey into the battlefront at La Rochelle will be a perilous one. Milady and Rochefort discuss Constance, whom the spy has sent to a private estate. Kitty dutifully gives the information to the musketeers, who agree to help rescue her while D'Artagnan goes ahead toward the battlefront. Constance is fettered in an upstairs room but manages to land a kick on one of the guards when he brings her food; once she has freed herself she runs to the window and finds the courtyard is filled with vicious attack dogs, preventing her escape. The next time a guard comes, she kicks him in the groin before realizing it is Aramis in disguise and she is being rescued. Porthos uses stilts to cross the courtyard with Constance perched on his shoulders to avoid the dogs. The three take her to convent at Armentieres. D'Artagnan stops at an inn where he plans to meet his friends and finds a note that they were thrown in jail for drunken behavior and sent on a few bottles of wine to drink their health. He declines, saying they will share the wine when they're together again. On the road D'Artagnan is set upon by Rochefort and his hired men, and when the other three musketeers hear dueling in the frigid weather, they join the fray, fighting on an icy lake with unpredictable footing. Still they manage to defeat the gang and take one with them to the inn to question him. He reveals that a meeting is planned at the Red Dove Cote Inn, begs for a drink and is poured some of the wine. Before the others join him, Aramis holds them back as the man quickly goes into convulsions and dies. Sniffing the wine, Aramis says it has been poisoned, probably by Milady. At the Red Dove Cote Inn, Milady meets with the Cardinal and discusses her agenda to rid herself and Rochefort of D'Artagnan and Constance after she does her duty for Richelieu in handling Buckingham, but the Cardinal is unconcerned with her private affairs. She asks for no money for dealing with the duke; she asks instead for carte blanche to deal with her enemies in her own way, and Richelieu produces a vague and craftily written note with his authorization but no words which can be used against him. She tucks it away after he leaves, but suddenly Athos appears and confronts her for the first time since the fateful day when she robbed him of his honor. He asks her for the note, threatening to shoot her if she refuses. Knowing he is capable of it, she surrenders the note. On the battlefield the musketeers have been sent to lend support and see that La Rochelle falls. Athos makes a bet that the four of them can breach the enemy lines and have breakfast atop the bastion--a place where they can discuss matters without the Cardinal's spies within earshot--and they assign Planchet (Roy Kinnear) to bring the ammunition and provisions. They dodge bullets and manage to set up their meal, and Athos gives the note to D'Artagnan and tells them all of the plot to kill Buckingham. Planchet will be assigned to go warn Buckingham, and when the rebels charge the battlement, Athos finds the wall is weak enough that they can push it over to send its stones toppling down on the charging rebels. Milady travels to England to meet Buckingham but fails to convince him to cease aiding the rebels. Outside she prepares a concealed pistol but is caught and sent to the dungeon under the care of his servant Felton (Michael Gothard), a Puritan whose unbreakable faith and detached demeanor the duke trusts. During one visit to check on his prisoner, Milady asks Felton for a Bible, and during his duties he hears her reciting scripture nonstop. Finally she collapses and tells him that she is being persecuted by the Antichrist--Buckingham--and he yields to his doubts and her passions, and later he helps her escape. He proceeds to purchase a knife, meets Buckingham on the docks and uses the weapon to attack his master, who dies from his wounds while Planchet arrives moments too late to warn him. The battle of La Rochelle ends and Rochefort and Milady race the musketeers to Armentieres to claim Constance. The musketeers reach the town nearby just steps ahead of Rochefort, and when they stop for a rest, he gains the lead. The four men remount and give chase, enter the convent by another route but are met by Rochefort and his men. While D'Artagnan and the others battle, the barn next to the convent catches fire, adding to the urgency. Porthos manages to use his new sword technique to dispatch an opponent but catches fire himself; Athos sustains another arm injury and Rochefort escapes. Milady enters the convent disguised as a nun and goes into Constance's room to sit with her. Constance doesn't recognize her in the vestments, continues praying and starts to cry. Milady tells her she should look her best when D'Artagnan arrives, then throws a rosary around Constance's neck and draws it tight. As D'Artagnan finishes dispatching his enemies, Milady leaves Constance's room and attempts to make her escape but is caught by Athos before she can reach her carriage. D'Artagnan bursts into Constance's room to find her strangled body on the floor. He leaves in profound grief and comes upon Rochefort; assuming him the killer, he charges his arch enemy, attacking violently and taking out his anger and misery on him. Again, they are equally matched swordsmen. Aramis and Porthos see them dueling, but Aramis prevents his partner from interfering; it is D'Artagnan's fight alone. By the time the fighting reaches the church, both men have exhausted each other and neither will yield. Rochefort injures D'Artagnan's hand and deals a blow which takes the point off his sword. Desperate, D'Artagnan makes a final lunge and drives his sword home, pinning the spy to the lectern before he falls and dies, and the young musketeer collapses from exhaustion. Later the musketeers gather with their prisoner at a riverbank, standing in judgment of Milady's crimes. They decide the punishment should be death. Athos uses his privileges as a nobleman to hire a headsman and order the execution at the cost of five pistoles. She defiantly demands a trial by a proper court and, when nobody speaks up, she turns to D'Artagnan for help. When he steps forward Athos tells him, in no uncertain terms, that if he moves further the two of them will cross swords and Athos will kill him, so he resumes his place. They watch as the headsman takes Milady in a boat to a small jut of land on the other side of the lake and does his duty; when he returns they grant his request to be paid two pistoles extra for oarsman duties. The musketeers are then rounded up and D'Artagnan finds himself in Cardinal Richelieu's office again. Richelieu reminds him that he refused an offer of friendship and now stands accused of a serious crime. D'Artagnan then produces the Cardinal's own document granting the bearer the privilege to do \"what has been done.\" Knowing he has been defeated, the Cardinal casually burns the note and offers his foe a commission as a lieutenant in the musketeers with the name left blank, saying he and his friends are free to go. Perplexed, D'Artagnan leaves and offers the document to all three of his friends, who politely refuse. He worries that as an officer he will lose his friends, but Porthos assures him that they will always remain \"All for one and one for all.\"",

         "Don't watch this movie alone. That is, watch Richard Lester's \"The Three Musketeers\" with it. The two are actually the same film, shot simultaneously (in fact, the cast thought they were making one long movie, to the extent that they were *paid* for one movie; they later sued, as well they should have). In fact, one who hasn't seen Lester's \"Three Musketeers\" might not understand this movie. Videos and DVDs should be released only in a double-box. Most \"Musketeer\" movies are travesties loosely based on Dumas. The 1993 version with Chris O'Donnell is a case in point. It uses little more than the names of characters, and it's woefully inadequate. The script-writer in Lester's \"Musketeers\" movies was George MacDonald Fraser, author of the \"Flashman\" series. And Fraser, unlike writers of all other \"Musketeer\" movies, seems to have read the book. Some of the wildest things in both movies (for instance, Buckingham's shrine to Anne of Austria) are actually from Dumas. The script, rambunctious and silly as sometimes is, is startlingly close to the book. Rumor has it that Lester envisioned \"Musketeers\" as a project for the Beatles. If this is true, he's fortunate he lost them. The cast is uniformly wonderful. Oliver Reed, Richard Chamberlain, and Frank Finlay are perfect in their roles (Finlay is particularly marvelous as he, not a large man, is able to portray the huge, blustering Porthos). Michael York is a fun D'artagnan. Faye Dunaway and Christopher Lee are suitably evil. Rachel Welch, the Pamela Anderson of the late '60s, shows a flair for light comedy that was not often utilized (most of her other movies highlight her . . . ahem . . . other talents). Charlton Heston is the anchor at the center of the film as the scheming Richelieu. He doesn't have much screen time, but his presence dominates the movies, as well it should. Lester also has small parts filled with amazing talents, including Spike Milligan and Roy Kinnear. Keep your eye on a genuine Frenchman, Jean-Pierre Cassel, as the king (and, much later, in Lester's \"Return of the Musketeers\", as Cyrano); he's a delight in every scene. Lester's locations are fabulous. His France looks lived-in. One gets the sense of a long, medieval period that has decayed by the time of D'artagnan in the early 1600s, and of a struggling monarchy dominated by the Cardinal trying to rebuild it. Even Cardinal Richelieu, who wasn't really evil, comes off as three-dimensional (compare Heston's subtle performance to Tim Curry's bizarre, anti-historical, one-dimensional inquisitor and fool in the 1993 version). Being \"The Three (Four) Musketeers\", there are many sword-fights; Lester somehow is not a great action director, but he somehow manages to make each duel unique, and funny. In \"The Four Musketeers\" he's given us a duel on the ice between York and Lee that's very funny. And the climactic duel in a church is sublime. In 1989 Lester released \"Return of the Musketeers\" with the same cast. Fraser's brief script for that movie (about 100 minutes) gives us the gist of \"Twenty Years After\", and is quite amusing and a good coda for the series (it's a shame Lester didn't get a chance to do \"The Man in the Iron Mask\" with a G. M. Fraser script and the same cast. The version with Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich will do, though it's darker and less loyal to Dumas). On the whole, \"The Three Musketeers\" and \"The Four Musketeers\" are the best Musketeer movies ever made. They star men and women who were at the top of their profession at the time. The scripts are superb and there's not a wasted moment. Do not accept lesser substitutes.",
         "THE FOUR MUSKETEERS, the second half of Richard Lester's brilliant adaptation of Dumas' THE THREE MUSKETEERS, carries on the manic adventures of D'Artagnan (Michael York), and his comrades (Oliver Reed, Richard Chamberlain, and Frank Finley), and offers deliriously comic moments (a picnic in the midst of a siege is a comic highlight), but in being faithful to the novel, a necessary but tragic thread runs through the plot, with the deaths of key characters tempering the joy of the ultimate resolution. Because the film wasn't intended to 'stand on it's own', certain elements had to be added, to make the story more cohesive. The most obvious addition is a voice-over introduction by Porthos (Frank Finley), who reminisces about the events on screen. The choice of Finley is a wise one, as he was the most accessible of the characters in the first film, and his \"blissfully ignorant\" attitude keeps his opening and closing monologues a 'tongue-in-cheek' joy. Politics and intrigue are the order of the day, as Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston, still sleekly villainous) continues his machinations to eliminate French Protestants, and his major opponent, England's Prime Minister, the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward). A key player in 'the game' is Milady de Winter (Faye Dunaway, in one of her best roles), who agrees to eliminate Buckingham, if Richelieu will pardon 'in advance' her plans to murder D'Artagnan and his ladylove, Constance (Raquel Welch). The note he signs would become a key element of the story. Hoping to protect Constance, D'Artagnan sends her to an Abbey, then impetuously begins an affair with de Winter, not realizing the woman's ultimate goal. Only the discovery of a 'Fleur-de-Lis' tattoo on her arm, branding her a 'harlot', saves the boy, as it unbalances the woman long enough for him to temporarily subdue her, and escape. The news of de Winter's brand exposes Athos' aristocratic past, and reason for his alcoholism. Just as Van Heflin's interpretation of Athos during this key scene in the 1948 THREE MUSKETEERS was the film highlight, the flashback to a younger, clean-shaven, and dashing Oliver Reed, and his betrayal by Faye Dunaway, who would be branded for her crime, is a high point in the 1974 production. Milady is a calculating, insensitive monster, and as the depth of her potential for evil becomes known, the darkness that is introduced nearly overcomes the film. With a cunning almost feral, she ruthlessly arranges the death of Buckingham, then takes care of Constance personally. Finally captured by the four Musketeers, her doom, while justified, is a jarring counterpoint to the earlier adventures of the happy-go-lucky quartet. Yet the four comrades survive, and with the possession of Richelieu's note to Milady, are not punished for their actions, but granted extraordinary rewards by King Louis. Richelieu himself is impressed by D'Artagnan's amazing talent and luck, and arranges a promotion for the young Gascon. As the four friends leave the Palace, facing far different futures, Porthos reflects on the camaraderie of the friends, and through flashbacks, we are reminded of the glorious adventure we've shared with them. THE THREE and FOUR MUSKETEERS are a crowning achievement in Richard Lester's remarkable career, capturing a 'feel' that no other Dumas' adaptation has ever come close to. While the sequel may lack the unrestrained 'joy' of the first film, when seen together, the overall impact of the saga is unforgettable. They don't come any better than this!",
         "This film is part two of the movie \"Three and Four Musketeers\". This film is somewhat more serious in tone as is warranted by the events described in the book. Not quite as fun as the first movie but true to the classic story writen by Dumas back in 1850. (additional comments are duplicate comments made about the Three Musketeers) This set of films (3 and 4 Musketeers were filmed at the same time and released 8 months apart) ranks right up there with \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and \"Robin Hood\" (with Erol Flynn) as one of the best in its genre (action/adventure). As an historian, I enjoyed the small touches of historical accuracy in the film. As far as I can tell, everything is just about bang-on: the costumes, the settings, the weapons, the street life, and the musketeers themselves (and yes I know the story is not \"true\"). The two films are quite faithful to the classic book by Alexander Dumas given some small and reasonable changes. The sword-play in the film is the greatest! The initial duel against the Cardinal's men in the Convent is a masterpiece of choreographed combat. The battle that takes place early in the second film is hysterically funny as our heroes try to eat lunch in the middle of a war. The actors and actresses are all wonderful, especially Michael York, Oliver Reed, Faye Dunaway, and Charlton Heston. One small weakness in the film is that it does not have the time or interest in describing how Milady de Winter seduces her jailor. I suggest reading the book to get a full understanding of that sequence of events. Be warned, prolonged exposure to this film is likely to result in a desire for fencing lessons and historical reenactments. Bottom line: A great film.",
         "I was forced to wait 6 months between watching \"The Three Musketeers\" and getting an opportunity to watch this \"sequel\" (shot at the same time) and it was agony, though I was somewhat afraid that the second one would not live up to its predecessor. I am glad to say that I was completely wrong and that this one more than lives up to its companion. The action is just as fast and the characters as endearing (because, as we learn, only Porthos could find \"a new way to disarm himself\" - and then make it work when it counted!) But comedy aside (such as our heroes eating breakfast in the middle of a battle), the serious turns that had to be taken in order to stay true to Dumas' novel were very well done also. Oliver Reed imparts his loathing for Milady DeWinter not only with his words, but also with the expression in his [gorgeous] eyes and when he holds her at gunpoint in order to get the Cardinal's warrant, several seconds go by in which you as a viewer actually believe that he will kill her right there in cold blood. In fact, Reed is, in my opinion, truly the star of this picture as his character of Athos attempts to mentor young D'Artangan and prevent him from being hurt. Michael York is, as usual, wide-eyed and very courageous and Finlay and Chamberlain continue to be terrific fops but it is Reed that carries them through. Kudos also have to go to Faye Dunaway as Milady - she is truly evil and charming at the same time and you can see how her character manages to be so good at what she does. I encourage everyone to see this movie - especially as a companion to \"The Three Musketeer\" - and support those in favor of having an edited-together three hour version. It is truly a classic. (And side note to my fellow students - if you don't have time to read the book \"The Three Musketeers,\" rent these two movies and you'll get the gist of what you need to know.)",
         "FINALLY...a DVD release called 'The Complete Musketeers' that does justice to a proper transfer, in widescreen and looking better than when I saw it in the theater. Watching 'The Three Musketeers' without seeing the 'The Four...' is like reading the Alexander Dumas novel; and stopping halfway through. It's a shame that it wasn't released as a roadshow 3 and a half hour film because that was the way it was originally meant to be experienced. Phenomenal DVD package that contains both films...just the way it should be. And some very informative documentaries with the surviving cast. 9 out of 10! (Same as my rating for 'Three Musketeers')",
         "Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan are back; or more precisely, are still here; for the second half of the Dumas novel. As I'm sure most fans know, this was meant to be part of the complete Three Musketeers, before the Salkinds split it into two films. This led to much litigation and the creation of the \"Salkind clause\" in movie contracts. Spoliers-The film takes up where the first part left off; D'Artagnan and the Musketeers have saved the Queen from embarassment and confounded the evil Cardinal Richelieu. D'Artagnan is now a full fledged Musketeer (although, in the novel, he was still just a guardsman). Now the Cardinal hatches a new plot to persuade the Duke of Buckingham from joining the protestant Huguenot rebels at the city of La Rochelle. Milady is sent to persuade him to change his mind or kill him. Although Buckingham imprisons her, he underestimates the power of her charms. The Duke meets a tragic end and Milady returns to France to seek her revenge on D'Artagnan. Meanwhile, D'Artagnan rescues his mistress Constance and places her in safekeeping. He learns the true identity of Milady and the mystery behind Athos' melancholy. The Musketeers are sent to fight at La Rochelle and uncover the Cardinal's plot to kill Buckingham. Although the other Musketeers care little, D'Artagnan owes a debt to Buckingham and tries to stop the plot. D'Artagnan pays a terrible price for his efforts, but emerges as a lieutenant of the Musketeers. He has taken his place as the leader of the group, but will find little solace in his promotion. As with the first film, the performances are spot on. Everything is the same, as it was filmed at the same time. It is best viewed as a whole with the Three Musketeers.",
         "Raquel Welch, Richard Chamberlain, Michael York, Geraldine Chaplin, Faye Dunaway, Charlton Heston, boy oh boy what a shining list of major stars of the 70's. The movie attracts my attention first because of the most-read French story, second the cast is absolutely another one. The chivalry tale is always the love of the directors and we have about 20 productions bearing the same name within the short movie history. The Spanish setting e.g. the fight in the old church is marvellous, I guess filming in Spain at that time didn't cost too much. Just look at the scheming and wicked black female spider Faye Dunaway is already a pure and high entertainment, and Michael York then looked really innocent and like loverboy.",
         "Although filmed together, the producers decided to release this adaptation of the Dumas classic in two parts, with this being the sequel to the 1973 film. The first film meandered initially before the main story line of the queen's diamond kicked in. Here too the film gets off to a rambling start. Unfortunately, things don't quite come together like they did in the first film. There is less of a sense of fun here, as the mood has darkened, which is not a bad thing except that the narrative is not very well sustained. While Welch was the female focus in the first film, this one belongs to Dunaway, who is excellent as the evil Milady.",
         "This movie is excellent. The Four Musketeers, along with the first movie, are the only movie versions that are remotely accurate to Alexandre Dumas's masterpiece novel, The Three Musketeers. The action and sword fighting in this film are great. They only add to a great story, and don't try to make up for a poor one. The only drawback is the portrayal of Raquel Welch's character, Constance. In the movie, she is too clumsy and ditsy. Constance is supposed to be smarter. Overall, I thought this film was great. I would recommend reading the book. However, if you hate reading, then you should watch this movie, along with the Three Musketeers, because they are the closest to the book. The Four Musketeers shows that it is possible to make a version of the Three Musketeers that's accurate to the book and still enjoyable to watch.",
         "This \"sequel\" (actually filmed along with \"The Three Musketeers\" but released separately later--much to the consternation of its cast who had intended to do one film and were paid for one, but who later sued for compensation! That would make a movie in itself!) brings all the elements of the first film together for a shattering finale. The films play MUCH better back to back so that the interest and emotion carry through from the beginning to the end. Still, this is quite effective and a more thorough fleshing out of the second tier of the story than what has ever been shown before (even though many elements and even characters have been eliminated.) Rising to the forefront this time around is the fiendish, dangerous, glamorous Dunaway as Milady de Winter. Fans of \"Mommie Dearest\" will see the groundwork she laid here when she mistreats her servant girl, Kitty. Dressed up to the hilt in satin, feathers, beads and ruffles she is a towering presence, as striking to watch as she is deadly. She displays some truly menacing expressions along with some high comedy. It will be a long time before a viewer will forget Dunaway's scream as she is branded a harlot (in flashback.) Reed gets to show more range in this half as well and he's excellent. They make for an unusual and intriguing pairing. Some of the stars of the first film get shorter shrift here (Chaplin, Ward, Welch), but all are still around and have their moments. Then underused actors from part one (Lee, Dunaway) get their turn here. Welch is actually funnier in this half than in the first with her mishaps after she is held captive. Certain images linger in the memory...Dunaway's encounter with some Indians in England, her use of a rosary in the convent, Welch's safekeeping of the key to her shackles, Lee's final sword duel, flashbacks of Reed and Dunaway as a couple and the sequence with the executioner. These are just a few of the many vivid scenes in the film which also include sword fights on the ice and in a burning barn. Though certainly a companion piece to \"The Three Musketeers\", this is a magnificent piece of film on its own and was inexplicably ignored at most awards ceremonies."
