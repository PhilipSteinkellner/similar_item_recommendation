         "content": "> Too protective mother and her grown up son keen to choose his own path.\r\n\r\nIt is a 2nd directional feature for Helen Hunt. She also starred in a prominent role which is about a mother-son relationship. I don't understand why it was rated very low, but I like this rare movie, which portrayed parent-children bond in an emotional way. Such kind of a beautiful film the last time I saw was the 'The Guilt Trip', I guess. Only the women filmmakers can make films like this.\r\n\r\nMaybe this movie hit my weak point, I'm always sympathetic to the old people's struggle. Anyway, I liked the Helen Hunt's role and she was not struggling, but wanted to connect with her son who's grown up and trying to stretch his wings to fly away from her. This is very usual in the real world, an affectionate father towards his daughter and the same to a mother towards her son. I find this kind of themes are very cute and touches me.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing bad about the direction, but the screenwriting. Helen Hunt is not a great writer, in some parts the film was very dry. Feelingless emotions, but overall keeping the prime target as a mother who's pursuing her son for some reason. There were a few scenes that added the fun flavour to the movie.\r\n\r\nI wanted to give more points it, but I can't. Besides, I can recommend it to the people who're interested to have a movie about the family issues. Not like couples having a quarrel, but between parents and their kids, like maybe similar to the one I mentioned in the first paragraph.\r\n\r\n7/10",

         "I viewed this movie from the standpoint of a parent of an adult child as is the main character, Jackie. In my view this is what the story is about, how a parent lets go and enjoys watching her child make their way as an adult. In doing so, she is able to move on to becoming a more authentic person as well. I've always been a fan of Helen Hunt and although her appearance has changed, she still brings us her ability to make us feel we are watching a woman bravely dealing with what life is bringing her way. The film present a great contrast between their lives in New York and California. The son, Angelo, travels to CA to visit his dad. I'm a little surprised at how quickly the son, Angelo, adapts to the different lifestyle. Luke Wilson as Jackie's love life is a good match. His calmness contrasting with her franticness plays well.",
         "Helen Hunt looks vastly different in this movie. It's only relevant if you are a fan of Hunt's before this movie. I found the movie very relatable as Helen hunt plays an overbearing single mother whose college aged son, drops out to surf in California and she follows him from New York in order to connect by learning how to surf herself. It's a drama driven by Helen Hunt in center stage and a coming of age story that not only focus on a boy trying to figure out his life but a mother trying to let go of the boy becoming a man, so in a lot of ways it's her coming of age story as well. Not the best movie about surfing I've ever seen but I think I've only see two (Point Break and Johnny Tsunami), but it's one of those movies that really grounded on real life emotions and dealing with real life things. It was a good Helen Hunt movie.",
         "My impression is nearly everyone is responding to this in stereotypical ways - seeing the mother as impossibly overbearing and interfering. Actually mother and son have a great relationship. They argue intensely and in detail about what his stories should be like - and about life and their relationship in general. This is very well portrayed. And most of us should be so lucky to have such a relationship. So she takes it too far - but hardly in a Tennessee Williams way. And they argue intensely about that too, and work their way to a successful conclusion. Sure, it's all a little too Hollywood pat and neat in the end. But you have an unusual portrait of an unusual and very good mother-son relationship - and a very passionately involved mother. She's very OK. I enjoyed it a lot.",
         "This is a down to earth film about real life. It tackles among other thing the sometimes odd relationship between a mother and son, which are brilliantly played by Helen Hunt and Brenton Thwaites. The mother has a real hard time letting her son go as he's turning into a grown up that doesn't need his mother anymore. As a know-it-all person that likes to be on top of things she follows her son to California from New York and spies on him as he's trying to find himself and experience new things while living with his laid back dad that just want's him to do whatever makes him happy. Her ridiculous behavior is quite funny as is her interactions with the chauffeur that she hires to drive her around while stalking her son. This odd behavior is explained as the story enfolds and a tragedy from the past is brought to light. This a story about a person that seems to be in complete control of her life, but then she's swept away by changes and has to let her self go, learn to trust others and embrace the unexpected. The film is both funny and sad, and very beautiful, specially the surfing scenes that are a perfect setting for a person that is learning to be humble and accepting.",
         "OK, I know we all have different tastes in movies but I have a really hard time believing anyone found this better than a 5 even if they worship Helen hunt. I personally LOVE her but hated her in this movie. I never turn off movies because I always hold out hope they will finish strong. My goodness, this didn't. I liked her Chauffeur but all of the young people in the movie were just plain annoying. When they weren't arguing or smoking dope they just came across like lawn furniture. I know I live in the great American Flyover but, geez, Hollywood, try to do something outside of LA and New York. They are both ugly and tired. I just saw another movie filmed in the woods and it was beautiful and interesting.Give it a try. Helen, you are awesome, one of my favorite actresses but if this is how you direct a movie, please, keep acting and leave that to someone else.",
         "My first impression of the movie was the dialog, and it seemed very unnatural as in normal people do not speak that way it seemed as if every conversation was contrived. Her son was overreacting and livid in an unnatural way, Helen Hunts Character was irritating which I think she wanted to be overbearing well she succeeded in that. Luke Wilson was a hollow character that did not serve much purpose but maybe he was not supposed to. Is this the way overeducated people speak? David Zayas from Dexter was in it as her driver and still not sure what his role was there for besides making painful quizzical faces. The whole movie seemed jumpy . disjointed. with conversations that seems out of place and over written. The only real part of the movie was the surf scenes which were quite accurate for learning surfers. Not sure what the aim of the movie was but with me as a viewer it missed the target.",
         "I was looking forward to this film being an uplifting and enjoyable experience, it was nothing of the sort. Formulaic rubbish story about an over indulged son with a an overbearing mother suddenly discovering and valuing each other.None of the characters in this film inspire you to want to know anything about them or give a damn about them , the son is an obnoxious brat and the mother is just a cliché of the over achieving parent without a soul. The film could have been so much more uplifting but it wasn't it was just dead in the water which , by the way, is where you want the characters to be. Absolute rubbish of the worst kind with no redeeming qualities.",
         "Helen Hunt directs as well as stars in this terrific film. With incredibly raw power and overwhelming imagery, this is a motion picture that deserves a wide release so that all may experience true film greatness. Hunt not only directs brilliantly, she gives what may well be the performance of a lifetime. Beautifully photographed and elegantly scored, the movie will seduce audiences with its incredibly story. The script is intelligent and literate and provides a story of magnificent yet subtle power. Seldom in the history of cinema do all elements needed for true greatness come together in such sublime fashion. Ride is indeed one of those rare instances.",
         "I expected more from Helen Hunt. This movie was boring (basically just watching Helen Hunt's character learn to surf over and over). The guy who plays the son, his acting is not good. Cringeworthy really. There is no sexual discovery. Just a one night hook up in a hotel room. The characters are extremely one-dimensional and uninteresting...and unlikeable. There is nothing to like about this mother and son. Luke Wilson is the ONLY pleasant part of this movie. At points, you almost sensed that even his character didn't like the mother and son either. It is a really bad movie and I am not fussy. I'll put up with a little cheesiness but this movie had nothing to offer. You could watch it to laugh at how bad it is, that's about the only value you'll find here.",
         "It is a 2nd directional feature for Helen Hunt. She also starred in a prominent role which is about a mother-son relationship. I don't understand why it was rated very low, but I like this rare movie, which portrayed parent-children bond in an emotional way. Such kind of a beautiful film the last time I saw was the 'The Guilt Trip', I guess. Only the women filmmakers can make films like this. Maybe this movie hit my weak point, I'm always sympathetic to the old people's struggle. Anyway, I liked the Helen Hunt's role and she was not struggling, but wanted to connect with her son who's grown up and trying to stretch his wings to fly away from her. This is very usual in the real world, an affectionate father towards his daughter and the same to a mother towards her son. I find this kind of themes are very cute and touches me. There's nothing bad about the direction, but the screen writing. Helen Hunt is not a great writer, in some parts the film was very dry. Feelingless emotions, but overall keeping the prime target as a mother who's pursuing her son for some reason. There were a few scenes that added the fun flavour to the movie. I wanted to give more points it, but I can't. Besides, I can recommend it to the people who're interested to have a movie about the family issues. Not like couples having a quarrel, but between parents and their kids, like maybe similar to the one I mentioned in the first paragraph. 7/10",
         "What a great script. Witty dialogue and a charming portrayal of a mother finding her way through the life crisis she wasn't quite able to admit she was living. The relationship between mother and son as he turns adult and struggles to find his way instigates the mother into her own hero's journey. The handsome helpers she picks up along they way in the roles of her driver and the and the surf instructor slash lover provide both comic relief and the opportunity for us to see her vulnerability, humanity, willingness and drive to be the best mother and person possible despite her neurosis. A bonus delight in this film is that our leading lady seems to be full on aware of her crazy, this level of self acceptance invites us all to be as we are, where we are, on our way to being who we are becoming. Well done Helen Hunt, well done.",
         "I'm conflicted. Normally a movie of this type will be interesting and fun for most of the first 80 minutes and then end in a clunky manipulative way. It is that rare movie that is stubbornly insufferable for more than 80 minutes and then ends in a weirdly satisfying if predictable way. It can be unbearable at times to watch Helen Hunt try and act her way through her impassively clay-like new face, as if she were a Star Trek Changeling character. It can be maddening at times at how sympathetic and misunderstood she thinks her character is. And it can be frustrating at how mechanical the scene construction and the in your face symbolism feels. But I have to admit that there is a charming tone that coalesces nicely in the last 15 minutes. You know what's coming, and the unflinchingly cheesy dialogue up to this point is often unintentionally amusing, but when it happens at the end it feels real, just like the ending to the story she's been discussing with her son. There's just enough of a spark there to make you understand why she wanted to make this movie.",
         "Review: I wasn't a massive fan of this film because I found it a bit far fetched and over the top in parts. Its about a busy New York woman, Jackie, who finds it hard to let her son go when it's  time for him to go to college and before he leaves, he spends some time with his dad in Los Angeles. She then decides to visit his college to give him a few bits and pieces and she is told that he dropped out, without telling her a thing. At this point she should have just called him to discuss his decision not to go to college but she jumps on a plane and hires a limo to spy on him, so she can see what he is up to. Her cover is blown when the limo driver crashes into his car and he's not too happy about her being in Los Angeles. Her son has a deep passion for surfing so she takes up the sport to spy on him. She realises that it's not as easy as it seems, so she hires an instructor to teach her how to surf. Within a few minutes, she falls for the strapping instructor, played by Luke Wilson and she carries on pursuing her son to try and convince him to go back to college. Its a weird comedy which has a couple of funny moments but there isn't that much going on. Her son has no respect for his mum and he just talks to her like crap half of the time. The acting isn't bad but there isn't much depth to the characters, especially Jackie who obviously has mother and son issues. The father also seemed to be missing through most of the movie and he didn't have that much to say when she showed up at his house in the middle of the night, cursing in front of his little daughter. Anyway, it's a watchable feel good movie about self discovery and relationships but it's not one that I will be watching again soon. Average! Round-Up: This is the second movie directed by Helen Hunt who also directed, wrote and starred in Then She Found Me with Better Midler and Colin Firth. Personally, I think that the script could have done with a rewrite because of the lack of information about the individual characters. Anyway, at 52 years old, she has starred in over 80 movies which are mostly drama and romantic comedies. She won an Oscar in 1998 for her brilliant role in As Good As It Gets, alongside Jack Nicholson who also won an Oscar for best actor and she hit top form in 2000 with Pay It Forward, Cast Away and What Women Wants but she has gone under the radar since then. After having a 3 year break after her directorial debut, she has struggled to hit the same form that she had in 2000 but she still pops up in a few movies now and again like Bobby and the Sessions were she was nominated for another Oscar for best supporting role. This film also starred Australian born Brenton Thwaites, 26, who recently starred in the Giver, Maleficent, Son of a Gun and the Signal. I did find his character annoying in this movie but thats down to writing more than his acting ability. He has a role in the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie and in God's of Egypt with Gérard Butler so he has a lot to look forward to. Anyway, Helen Hunts spoilt brat, attitude throughout this movie gets a bit much after a while and her sons lack of respect for her also let's the film down. I recommend this movie to people who are into their comedy/dramas about a woman who follows her son to Los Angeles to find out why he has dropped out of college. 3/10",
         "The movie starts with a mother reading outside her son's bedroom door in the middle of the night. Years later, assuming it is the same mother and son, son Angelo is having difficulty finishing the story he is writing to submit to publishers. Mom Jackie, hard at work on other authors' work, is giving him advice which he doesn't really want. It is June, and Angelo and Jackie look at the room he will have at NYU in the Fall. NYU is 85 steps away from home. And Angelo doesn't feel like he is \"going away\" to college. Jackie doesn't want to let him go. But why would Angelo want to leave? Jackie has what must be a great job as an editor of fiction books. The apartment building has a doorman. Later, Jackie gets on a plane and flies first class and hires a limo, not a taxi, when she arrives. Her nervous boss worries he won't be able to get in touch. She assures him she will have a special ringtone for him and she will answer. That ringtone sounds like a very loud version of the vibrating noise cell phones make, and it's not only annoying but funny. We hear it many times, and amazingly, Jackie is able to convince the boss she is in New York City or at least nearby and always working. And she can do the work thanks to technology. Angelo will get to spend six weeks in California with his father Peter and his pregnant wife and daughter. Angelo looks forward to surfing, something he can't do in the polluted waters of New York. Jackie finds out Angelo cancelled his college plans. She flies to Los Angeles and hires Ramon to drive her. Poor Ramon doesn't know what he's getting himself into, but he is very dedicated. Jackie becomes dependent on him for not only driving but everything else, including advice since she is quite clueless, despite her intelligence in areas of life she knows. If her son wants to surf, she will too. How hard can it be? She goes in wearing a normal swimsuit (and looks great in it, by the way; later, she is lying in bed wearing just a towel and showing off her legs).  No, that water is cold. So she will get a wet suit, very hard to put on. Now, a lot of physical comedy. Jackie swims at the gym in New York City, so learning surfing should be no problem.  No, she doesn't need an instructor. Yes she does. Ian is 37 and thinks Jackie is hot. Maybe, but her face shows her age, in my opinion. Jackie claims to be 37. And she tries to do things her way rather than listening to Ian, but she quickly realizes, after numerous falls, that she needs to listen to him. Meanwhile, Angelo is enjoying his new life. He is making friends, including Blanche, who is nice. He is reading books that no one is telling him to read and still struggling to sell his story. He meets an older man who is a successful writer but still must do another job to make a living. He ends up running into Jackie more than once, including when she gives him help getting the book published but tries to hide this fact. Angelo is not pleased his mother followed him and doesn't really want her hanging around and helping. Jackie also hides her attempts to learn surfing, which remain hilarious. Everything keeps going wrong. She even has an opportunity to get high. So will Jackie and Angelo solve their problems? And you'll be amazed at the ending. I didn't recognize Helen Hunt when she was still wearing those hideous glasses at home. Even without glasses, she didn't exactly look familiar. I watched a handful of \"Mad about You\" episodes but she has changed somewhat. Her hairstyle is still cute. She looked like she did in \"Shots Fired\", filmed near where I live (the only reason I watched); that led me to conclude that might be her. No wonder she's so good. And so funny. And she even wrote and directed, something I didn't know until the end. And she can do physical comedy! It looked quite dangerous, but surely there were stunt performers. And I suspected, and later was proved right by the credits, that some visual effects might have been added. That makes more sense than doing everything where it would be the most hazardous. Everything looked real. The TiVo summary also said \"Comedy, surfing\". It took me a while to be certain I was supposed to be laughing. Not until the surfing lessons began was I absolutely certain. But later on there is so much drama and so much conflict that calling this a comedy seems incorrect. There are reasons why Jackie and her ex broke up, though the new family is quite nice. Brenton Thwaites is a name I have never heard. He's likable enough. Luke Wilson is a talented comic actor I am somewhat familiar with. I didn't recognize him but he is patient and caring. David Zayas is to be commended for putting up with all the nonsense. And of course there is Richard Kind. This is the type of role for which he is ideal. I'm just sorry he only appeared in one scene and I could only hear him over the phone even then. I'm not even sure I was supposed to be able to understand anything he said but his frustration comes through. While it's not the highbrow material Helen Hunt might be expected to do, it's certainly a fun and well-done farce.",
         "Being a faithful fan of Helen Hunt I'm hurting. Firstly, her charm: mostly absent, replaced with this concerned, suffering look we typically see in Meryl Streep's roles. Secondly, her aging: somehow many scenes portray HH as an old woman. Was it intentional? Perhaps, considering that pool of film professionals, who do transformations of characters. However, I fail to see reasons for such decision. Finally, I was permitted to remain under the impression that the whole justification for making this movie was for HH to be around younger men. Some kind of a \"trophy role\". I would be happier to see other reviews and points of view that would make me drop that hurting.",
         "We found this movie on Netflix streaming. It is written and directed by Helen Hunt, who also stars. The animosity displayed between the mom and her son is hard to get past at times but overall it ties up with an important life lesson. Helen Hunt is Jackie, a New York author and publishing company executive. She drives her career hard and has a few quirks. We see some early when she is at a high-rise swimming pool doing laps using the dog paddle, so that she never has to get her hair wet. She is single and has a son, Brenton Thwaites as Angelo. He is also an aspiring writer, finishing high school, and set to attend an arts and science college in Manhattan. Their backstory of sorts is that she has become very attached to her son, as well as being very demanding of his writing, probably as an overreaction to having her other son die in his youth. All that sets up the core of the story which is Angelo dropping out of college to travel to California to be near his father. He wants to get away from the New York rat race and figure out what he wants to do, citing many examples of successful authors who didn't finish college. But mostly he wants to move far away from mom. Mom doesn't get angry, at least not much that we can see, instead she packs a bag and unannounced travels to California. She has had a problem letting go and at one point when Angelo mentions surfing, as one example of something Jackie would never do, she stubbornly tells herself it can't be that hard, she'll just get a board and begin surfing. She learns the hard way there's much more to it. The title \"Ride\" is a reference to riding that wave, finally, as a metaphor for her letting go a bit, for herself and also for her son. In the end he decides to move back to New York and resume his college but she decides to stay in California, beginning to give her son the freedom he deserves. Early in the movie when mom and son discuss how to end a fictional story her saying is it should be \"something surprising and inevitable.\" That is the ending Helen Hunt wrote into this screenplay.",
         "Interesting movie and though I have never really been a major fan of Helen Hunt, I was most curious to see this movie because she had written the screen play. True to form, her acting appears similar to most of the things she has done..a stilted kind of speech that at times feels forced,contrived, and not at all fluid. The beginning dialogues with her son force one to almost hit pause, rewind, to listen again....the words so verbose and clumsy with wordplay and intensity. Still, once the movie gives away to the California setting, the characters also appeared to \"relax\" a bit and things actually became enjoyable.. The underlying storyline appears...a story of loss and control over what was lost and to ensure what IS, can never be lost.. (and in that, lies the blurred and somewhat contentious relationship between mother and son).. If you can get past the beginning, I would recommend this movie...Helen Hunt has written a fairly poignant screenplay..",
         "I am a huge fan of Helen Hunt and I loved the cast member list when I chose to watch it on Netflix. I tried four times to get through it but had to hit fast forward finally, the last time, so I could just get an idea of how it ended. This is probably the only movie of hers that I felt like she was stifled, holding back and underplaying her talent. I just want to ask WHY would this appeal to her? Maybe the script was much better, but this was quite possibly the most dry, long, drawn out, movie I have tried to watch in a very long time. The only redeeming quality in it was the cast members. I've seen her friend and limo driver in Dexter and he's great.",
         "I'm still not sure how much I enjoyed this movie. The constant arguing of the mom and son got old. The way he kept referring to her by her first name began to annoy me. Each and every phone conversation was arguments!! She should have got into his face and insisted on respect. Instead, she just accepted it, tacked it up to her failure and more pain. I recently scattered my folks ashes off the shores of Hawaii. That was tough (emotionally speaking) scene to watch. Brought back memories. I have an 18 year old son, myself, who recently left the nest. Her emotions of her son moving away rang home. Although I have done a better job than her so far and have let him go. At the end, when she tells him she is staying in LA, and the he tells her he's going back to New York, was she thinking \"really?? I was staying here to be in the same city as you!!\" It was an OK movie. I actually enjoyed Luke Wilson the most in this movie. The Limo driver was enjoyable too. Oh, and I think Helen Hunt is not aging very well at all!!'",
         "I began watching this movie because I really like Helen Hunt. After about the first 15 minutes, I thought I was watching a re-run of Mad About You. I'm not from New York, so I don't know if this is the way New Yorker's always talk, but I found it so annoying. The same formula that was used in the MAD ABOUT YOU again. Back then, it was cute, and funny, but after you here that same monotone critical voice it's like fingernails down a chalkboard. I'm sorry Helen, time to shake it out and try something else. Maybe, like one of the other contributors mentioned, stick with acting. Unfortunately, you can't go back, it just doesn't work anymore. I know she Helen Hunt had good intentions but I personally felt left out. Move to California, see how the other half lives and talks. There is another world outside of New York.",
         "Ride When a woman says that she's riding the crimson wave it doesn't mean she's a sunrise surfer. Mind your, the middle-aged mom in this dramedy could be the exception. When her son Angelo (Brenton Thwaites) drops out of college to pursue his writing and surf aspirations on the West Coast, Jackie (Helen Hunt) takes a hiatus from her editing job to keep an eye on him. In California she starts taking surf lessons from Ian (Luke Wilson) and discovers a new side to herself apart from her son's post-secondary life choices. Free to explore, Angelo also finds his rebellious view on education may not be the best option for his art. From its superficial self-discovery script to its stock surfing shots, this vanity project from writer/director Helen Hunt does little to showcase any noteworthy talents beyond her established acting ability. Nevertheless, surfer parents sound way less involved than helicopter parents. Red Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",
         "I had two roommates who went to film school. I always went to the student screenings with them and a flask of Vodka to play the film student drinking game. Rule number one was take a drink if the movie showed someone peeing. Rule #2 if the movie starts with someone peeing drink 5 shots. I would have been wrecked if this was a student film. And it really felt like one. This movie gave me a head ache after about 10 minutes. I don't think 10 minutes in the whole movie went by without an argument that brought nothing to the story. I kept going hoping there would be some great surfing sequences but even those were hard to get through. The romantic connections in the film were contrived at best. The one shot that did totally crack me up was Helen Hunt's character trying to swim without getting her hair wet at the beginning but I realized it was a little too much her and not her character. Anyway, stick to acting Helen.",
         "I stumbled on this film when Helen made a guest appearance at Conan O'Brien show in May'15 promoting the film. If I recall correctly she said that she produced it, did the casting etc and her most favorable part was that she could pick male actors (like it is usually men cast women and this time it is all different) and essentially define not only the storyline but all the details. What she hadn't mentioned was I guess that the core-story was quite personal for her (although I wouldn't know for sure if this was the love or the children or something else). Although the story seems to be around a classic mother-son relationship challenges ( and some reviewers indeed look at the film like it is such a cliché - This is where I would apparently disagree with them) what I noticed is a different sense layer that is more focused on a philosophical \"enjoying life\" (and I put this into the subject line) question that I assume many people eventually run into. I wouldn't reveal the details, but I believe that one can find something in this movie that looks quite refreshing in terms of breaking work-sleep- work chain and triggers some further thinking on how it should be \"right\".",
         "I was a Helen Hunt fan until this movie. Her character was very disturbing and in my opinion she was a stalker. Very creepy! The fighting, the spying and the constant texts back and forth were extremely annoying. Helen leave your son alone and let him live his life! What amazed me was that the driver and her surf instructor seemed to think that what she was doing was OK. What really did it for me was when she walked into her son's bedroom when he was with his girlfriend...that was over the top. Then she cussed at her son, the step mother and the father for no reason when she barged into their home! The only character that had any real substance was the driver. I can't believe that I made it to the end...I kept waiting for something good to happen. If you were a Helen Hunt fan, don't watch this movie...you will be sorely disappointed!",
         "How many scenes of an old lady learning to surf do we need to watch? I suppose that most movie people's worlds revolve around N.Y. and L.A. They write about what they know, so I guess I can't blame them for that, but jeez, how is someone in Wisconsin going to relate to this clichéd garbage? Who cares what an 18 year old has to say about anything in literature other than the kid himself? A main part of the story is this silly kid agonizing about some stupid short story he's writing. What's the rush kid? Even his stupid mom was explaining to him that you have to live first. Helen Hunt must have thought that the old \"Mad About You\" Paul Reiser New York Jewish argumentation thing can be transferred to any setting, Even when it's being done by an old skin and bones waspy lady on a surfboard. This thing is just neurotic argument after neurotic argument. What disgusting people. Why would a slim 37 year old surf teacher want to get it on with some old bag of bones who never shuts up? Helen Hunt was attractive for about 10 seconds when she was 18 herself. She shouldn't place herself in romantic films anymore. What's the deep message here? Follow your heart, or give new experiences a chance? Gee that's original. If there are no likable characters, no depth, no humor, and routine photography, what is there to like about such a film? Answer: nothing."
