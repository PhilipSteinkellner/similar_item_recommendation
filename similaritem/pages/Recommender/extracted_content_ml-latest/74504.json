The two paths cross when Leila, who has recently been pardoned from a life-sentence for murder, goes to work as a personal assistant for Pastor Jacob. Each day the mailman brings letters from people asking for help from Father Jacob. Leilas job is to read aloud the letters and answer them as the pastor prays and gives encouragement. Pastor Jacob is old, he is blind. Answering the letters is his life mission; Leila thinks the whole thing is pointless. After all, she is not a Believer. But the job, which comes with a place to live, is pretty much the only option available to her at this stage in her life. For all its beauty, the secluded parsonage in the countryside, is another form of prison for Leila. Finally, she cannot take it any more. One idea is to borrow some cash from the house and leave. But one day the letters stop coming. Father Jacobs life is shaken to its foundation. Leila cannot leave him now. Physically fragile before, now he is spiritually at his breaking point. In the beginning it was Leila who needed a roof over her head, and a job. Now it is Father Jacob who needs to be rescued. Leila rouses Jacob from his despair and an unexpected thing happens: a door opens to Leilas past. She steps forward. And then both she and the pastor are freed.",

         "Careful, finely-honed directing by Klaus Härö features wonderful performances by Heikki Nousiainen and Kaarina Hazard. Brilliant casting. Small, tiny, luminous inventions are everywhere; nothing is heavy-handed. The story, first written by Jaana Makkonen, is austere, moving; the film ends just where it needs to in order for the story resonate. In any other person's hands besides Härö's, the result could have been disastrous. Why? Because the story does not appear to be overtly exceptional; and the visuals of the film need to be composed with the actors in natural, country surroundings and among existing buildings and a church. Härö, a cinematic poet, transmutes the physical materials he has on hand into gold. See this film if you dislike badly made movies and yearn for outstanding quality.",
         "If you want to see cinematographic art, see this movie. I won't tell the plot. This is something you can find on other sites. The movie is moving and deeply thoughtful while being light and entertaining. A reflection on today's world without being schoolmarmish. It is comparable to Whale Rider in the storytelling. And it is beautifully photographed as well. There are scenes where just the movement of the birch tree leaves by the wind are shown and they themselves tell a story. A must see. I hope it will be shown in many countries. I have seen it at the Vancouver International Film Festival. It didn't win, unfortunately. Well done Finland. I hope to see more from this director and crew.",
         "I've seen lots and lots of Finnish movies, but this was the best one of them. It went straight to my top 10 movies. It lasts only a little over an hour, but still I think it's the most important film Finnish have done. I loved everything in this clip, and I think you will too, at least the ones who like to watch art movies. I ain't going to tell about the movies plot, 'cause all of you should definitely see this great piece of art. I want to thank the idealist behind all of this, Jaana Makkonen, and also the scriptwriter, Klaus Härö. You've both done something that is going to be part of our culture, and a way of understanding all over the world.",
         "Now here is a movie that everybody should see. A sad story, though not sentimental. The optimistic ending leaves you in a comfortable feeling that even the worst situation can turn to better. The Finnish landscape is beautifully pictured. Postcard like sceneries. Two brilliant actors, the directing is what you may expect from Härö: simply brilliant, as true as life. The filmmakers have shared a very strong trust in humanity. The most warmhearted priest meets a woman whose fate has been to suffer a jail sentence that should never have been judged. Do yourself a favor, watch this film.",
         "Very simple story, Leila (Hazard) gets pardoned from jail and gets a simple job and a roof over her head by working for the blind Father Jaakob (Nousiainen). The job is very simple. All she has to do is take care of him which isn't much and help him with his favorite past time which is read and write letters that come to him. Quickly you learn to love father Jaakob and understand he is just as human as everyone else is. Right off the bat we understand that there is some type of anger stored inside of Leila's head while we also wonder how she made it to jail in the first place. She also seems to neglect every time Jaakob offers some words of wisdom. The only other supporting character that we see throughout the 75 minute film is the postman (Keinonen). He has seemed to of developed a close relationship with father Jaakob over the years and loves seeing Jaakob's face light up when he delivers the mail. Of course Leila doesn't seem to be to happy with the man on the bike. It's a simple film. It is much like the simpleness of The Bycycle Thief as of both movies will keep you intrigued throughout the whole film. Very enjoyable. My rating 8.5/10 or A-",
         "As far as Finnish drama goes, this is pretty typical, though it has a visual style that's far more cultivated and deliberate than is normal. The film is full of details and carefully thought out use of lighting and sound. Atmospherically this is a very nice film and I managed to fully immerse myself into the world of it. So what went wrong? In short, the story, which should have been a bit longer. The basic idea is nothing special. A prisoner has served her time and is thus released on the condition that she goes to serve an elderly priest that needs her help answering his mail. Okay, so this is spiritual guest about finding the lost soul of this poor woman, I thought. And unfortunately that's pretty much all it is. And don't get me wrong, that alone could have made for a great film, if handled correctly. But it seemed almost as if the film makers were in a hurry to finish the story before it had had the proper time to unfold. You get the proper three act structure, but nothing more. I didn't feel like I had enough time to get to know these characters. We got the introductory scenes where their basic characteristics were established and almost immediately after that the film just ends. We get the emotionally cathartic ending alright, but it means nothing if we haven't managed to identify with these characters and we cannot do that if we are not given the time to do so. So yeah, the movie could have used a few extra scenes. Not too many, mind you, but at least a few. Now the mood feels like a whiplash, going from one end of the spectrum to another with almost no scenes in between. There is one or two, but I could have used a third or fourth. Aside from that major gripe, the film is rock solid. Both of the main actors are really talented and Father Jaakob (Heikki Nousiainen) especially just oozes the elderly charisma of someone who has seen it all and come out on the other side as a better man. Furthermore, the scenery is good, the dialogues are interesting and the whole premise has promise. It's just that I'm far more used to movies that take their time to tell the story so for me this felt more than little jarring. Perhaps it's just perfect for someone who has had a bit more experience with Finnish films, which are generally shorter than most Hollywood productions.",
         "This superlative film from Finland shows, better than most, how to tell a story with few words. The director, Klaus Haro, definitely shows the same skill with visual story-telling as that consummate master, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, famous most recently for Once Upon a Time in Anatolia (2011). The plot is simple: a youngish woman, Leila (Kaarina Hazard) is released from a life sentence in prison to take up a job as a personal assistant to a blind priest, Pastor Jacob (Heikki Nousiainen) out in the boondocks. Leila settles in, reading the pastor's letters from supplicants and writing necessary replies. Leila is not happy though; she resists Jacob's attempts at friendship; she avoids helping in other matters; she remains aloof, uncaring, unsatisfied. Until, one day, she notices that the postman fails to bring more letters for Jacob, and Leila discovers that things are never quite what they seem to be. The underlying story is complex, lyrical, philosophical, and ultimately heart-warming without being sentimental. The acting is simply perfect for the context: Kaarina Hazard, with a large bone structure, deep frowning face and brusque manner is every bit the ex-con and depressive personality � but why was she serving a life sentence? Why was she released? And why was she sent to the pastor, of all places? As the pastor, Heikki Nousiainen, is equally adept at portraying a gentle sage near life's end, supremely faithful to his god, forever upbeat and friendly, always with a gentle word for all, even for those who despise him, as Leila seems to do, at first. Dialog is sparse. Often, all that is needed is a quick look, a glance, a sigh, a slight groan of disquiet, as the two get to know each other and while the days meld into a seamless, almost timeless stasis with the gorgeous Finnish forests. Some comic relief is provided by the wary attitude of the postman towards Leila, as he brings the letters for Pastor Jacob. The sound track � mostly piano � is muted and fits the overall mood. We see the wind in the forest, and hear the river water. But, more than that, we hear the silence, particularly when the two sit, contemplating each other and their inner selves. The rain falls, the water drips through the ceiling into pots or buckets, and life must go on. Even for the Leila's of the world... It's a credit to the script writer and director that I was never squirming in my seat eager for something to happen. In fact, that never impinged upon my involvement with the unfolding story: so that's perfect pacing for me. My only criticism, though, is that story lacks true believability: it's possible, yes, but highly improbable in real life. No story is ever perfect, however. This one, though, comes close by promising nothing up front; and then, with a denouement that arrives like a meteor, it rips away any comfortable sang-froid to show us that, if you're prepared to dig deep within, you will indeed find promises to keep. Highly recommended for all adults, young and old. Eight out of ten for this effort, no question. February 28, 2013",
         "Lutheran church is the national religion in Finland. As a Lutheran, I was interested in this movie, which is set at a church in Finland. I think the main theme of the movie is the concept of love in Corinthian I chapter 13, which the pastor recites in preparation of a wedding ceremony: If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. *snip* And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love. The ending is surprising and moving. Brightness and darkness of light, rain and cloud, are effectively used in the impressive cinematography, typical in North European movies. The high rate in IMDb is no question. However, when I saw the movie, I couldn't simply be moved to tears. There are many questions in this movie, and I couldn't help thinking about them. In fact, it makes you think too much. Let me take an example from the 'storyline' on IMDb: Father Jacob spends his days answering the letters of the needy. Indeed, letters come every day. But Father Jacob does not look like a famous pastor known over the country. His church is almost forgotten by the villagers. How come many letters come to the pastor from over the country asking his advice and prayer? There are many other points that made me think about. But I can't write here to avoid spoilers. Anyhow, although the run time is short, this movie requires longer time to assimilate it.",
         "Have you ever seen a movie that just sneaks up on you? You find yourself watching a film that seem okay and then suddenly you realize that it's really a magnificent and moving picture? Well, I sure have and I wish it happened more often, that's for sure. Like \"My Afternoons with Margueritte\", \"Letters to Father Jacob\" is one of these sweet pictures. But, because it sneaks up on you, be sure to pay attention and fight that urge to turn it off--it's a terrific little film. The film begins in prison. Leila has been pardoned for her crime but she refuses to leave! It seems she has no where to go and is content to stay in prison. However, an old blind priest named Father Jacob has requested that she be paroled to him--as a housekeeper. She is not thrilled but has no other options and moves in with the guy. Her job is to do light housekeeping as well as read letters to him. Apparently, he's received thousands of letters from people requesting his advice and prayers and that is his ministry. Leila seems pretty bored by this and even begins tossing many of the letters away and contemplates running. However, she stays and then it happens--the film really goes right for the heart. I won't say more--it would spoil it. However, suffice to say it was NOT predictable, many questions are answered and you should have some Kleenex nearby. The bottom line is that this film is exceptional--great writing, wonderful natural acting by folks who do not appear to be professional actors (though they are--especially Heikki Nousiainen who has had many film appearances) and the direction was just wonderful. If you don't mind a film without explosions, super-stars or glitz but just want a great film about people, give this one a try---you'll be glad you did!",
         "first word - touching. but it is only a small suggestion. in fact, it is a kind of poem. puzzle of precise art to give to each piece not only importance but soul. it is beautiful but not the beauty is important. Kaarina Hazard, who remembers by Restituta Kafka, in an extraordinary role, mixture of force and storm of feelings, Heikki Nousiainen as priest who gives the light of Orthodoxy - delicate scene in church - in skin of Protestantism, Jukka Keinonen as postman - fragile, naive, full of fear. and the letters as axis of story. it is a gem. or an ice castle because, for director and viewer, the risk is same - to fall. but the gift is the subtle joy. that is basis for my invitation to see it. because it has potential of experience. because, like each good movie, it is a window - mirror. and because the faith has strange power to change a life."
