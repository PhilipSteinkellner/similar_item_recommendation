         "Una pistola en cada mano it's a saying that implies you are aware of the situation and trying to make the most of it. In this film, one can relate to any of the plots as it reflects a good script and a good cast that's not very common to find in a Spanish movie. Watching Ricardo Darín and Luis Tosar in the same scene is a gift to my eyes, as we're all watching two of the most remarkable actors there are in the Hispanic world. Javier Cámara, Leonor Watling and practically the total cast are incredibly good. It's probably the director's fault, as the quality of the performances are close to perfection. It's about time one bumps into a good story. Thank you, Cesc.",
         "A GUN IN EACH HAND is quite a misleading title given it is basically a series of short films with interlocking story lines and overlapping characters all having relationship dilemmas. Probably the most dialog driven Spanish film I have ever seen, once the viewer gets used to the idea that this is a look at adult relationships, you dispel the notion that there is a gun to be seen sometime. The title refers to having a go each way, being ready to fire sexually, or even a penis joke given the sexual entanglements. Probably about 15 minutes too long as a film, it is however, a modern photo album of interesting emotional dilemmas, one set in an office with a particularly clever role reversal is very funny, albeit quite cruel, but quite right too. It would make a terrific play for a small live theater... but as a film it is like a Spanish feature of the dilemmas seen on US TV in Seinfeld/Friends/Frasier, but a lot better.",
         "\"Una pistola en cada mano\" is the title of these film. This is an intimate film that has moments of life of several young couples still, entering adulthood, and residents in Barcelona, Spain. These different people are being found to throughout the film, 2 by 2 and talk about their daily problems crudely and sincerely. There are much sense in what they say actors: Eduard Fernández is great in his role as outcast, loser; Candela Peña very believable in his role as vengeful and witty companion work; Eduardo Noriega huge flirt in his role as timid and not under-resourced; Javier Cámara and Clara have a magnificent performance giving life to a divorced couple with child shared. Come on, life itself!.The life's contradictions. In general, the Spanish film isn't Almodovar's films, though this man is one of the best known, many only tolerate. Cesc Gay I feel great, with Garci, Mercero, Amenabar, Bigas Luna,Camus, Colomo, or Fernan Gomez. In conclusion, worth seeing and feeling this film. Regards, Javier",
         "It's hard to believe in any of the situations in this portmanteau of character sketches, because the writing is clever rather than dramatic, and the scenes are played self-consciously by actors and a director, who must think they're being a lot more charming/interesting/amusing than I did. There's smugness, and meanness in the way that these hapless 40 somethings are portrayed as they struggle with their lives in the kind of urban artificial situations usually presented in comedy sketches. The non-cinematic style is suited to a radio play, but most radio plays would give these kind of interactions a bit more pace; there's too much pausing - for us to laugh? There were very few titters in the cinema when I saw it. And I get the feeling we were supposed to laugh at, not with the characters. The last two sketches are cross-cut, as two separate women tell two separate male friends about their husbands' shortcomings. We (the audience) have no emotional investment in either the husbands or the wives, so why should we care about the husbands' impotence/violence/jealousy and its effect on the women? It's like being party to bitchy gossip about someone you don't know. The film left me with a sour taste; apart from not really believing in any of the characters, I didn't like them. This is one for cold metroplolitans."
