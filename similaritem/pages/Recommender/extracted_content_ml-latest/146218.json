         "OK, there is a fairly common plotline here, elevated by some intellegent dialogues and the topic of Hindu-Muslim riots in India (which were in the news then, related to the desecration of Babri mosque in India), and punctuated by the usual Indian song-and-dance numbers. Mamta looks sexy, Agnihotri looks the part of her doe-eyed lover, Paresh Rawal stretches his acting abilities and Danny is... well, the villain. Dimple is great as usual, but the real item here is Nana, who blazes across the screen (he got a Best Actor award for this), mesmerizing the viewer. Take him out, and this is yet another Indian potboiler about politics, crime, romance and bloodshed. Long after u forget the rest of the film, u will still remember all the scenes related to Nana. In fact, the director could have made the film more focused and gripping by taking out all the silly songs and sub-plots (even though i'm a bit partial to sexy rain songs featuring starlets like Mamta, they do seem to be out of place here). Like Pacino and De Niro, Nana Patekar's acting leaves u breathless and begging for more. If u r a fan of his, this is not to be missed. If u haven't seen any of his flicks yet, this is a FINE place to get started. Rating: 8/10",
         "Mehul Kumar's 1994 drama about the importance of battling social injustice stars Nana Patekar as Pratap, a decent but lazy man unwilling to fight for anyone's cause but his own. He is finally roused to action by a fiery reporter named Megha (Dimple Kapadia) and by the cruelty of a ruthless, exploitative businessman named Yograj (Tinnue Anand). This movie is the most talented scripture I have ever seen. This movie also starring in Mamta, Atul & Danny. The movie features one of the best direction that I have ever seen. This movie is so interesting that I watched it more than 20 times. All the actors must have take there time in making this film.",
         "earlier when Bollywood used to have limited budget, technicians, etc actors used to be the captain of the ship. this one has the one of the most capable actors of last few decades. thought i would like to encourage people to watch this film because of mehul kumar. this guy had a vision and it shows with every frame. its a full entertainment riot. Bollywood's fight club. it made me think for days when i 1st saw it when i was hardly 10. see it to believe in one man revolution. look it for acting, direction, story possibly every basic thing you can expect from a great film. surprisingly it has some funky music which was super-hit at that time and even today it will entertain you with lyrics. finally, this one is not for a miss.",
         "Mehul Kumar's 1994 Box-Office Hit 'Krantiveer' is dark & disturbing. It isn't a a masterpiece though, but its an effective human-drama, that arrests your attention by its brash & brutal story. But, if there is a reason why this film is unmissable, its, without a shed of doubt, Nana Patekar's Astonishing Performance as the righteous/tough hero. 'Krantiveer' is a story about vengeance, love, hatred & racial-discrimination. 'Krantiveer' comes in-tact with some masterful, hard-hitting dialogue, that leave a terrific impact. Mehul Kumar's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography is perfect. Editing is sharp. Nana Patekar left me astonished with his National-Award Winning Performance. The Actor takes an unforgettable turn & performs fearlessly from start to end. Its a performance, that deserves to be watched & respected! He's the soul of 'Krantiveer'. On the whole, 'Krantiveer' is an effective film, along-with a performance that's utterly unforgettable.",
         "This movie worth National award. Nana's acting performance in this movie is excellent. Story,plot revolves around the tensions created by politics in India. If you ignore the typical Bollywood's over dramatization, this movie depicts the close happenings of real world elections during 90's. Both direction and acting are brilliant. Nana's, Jackie's acting are the finest of both their careers. Dimple Kapadia has also depicted Character in an finest way possible. Movie clearly tries to show the Political control over the media for monitory gains. This movie is of a great message to society."
