      "overview": "The mountain slopes of Iceland are shown to excellent advantage in the Scandinavian epic Hagbard and Signe. The story, based on an ancient legend, concerns Hagbard (Oleg Vidov), the son of a slain Norse king. Seeking revenge against the rival clan responsible for the killing, Hagbard calms down long enough to establish a truce. He also falls in love with Signe (Gitte Haenning), daughter of his onetime enemy. Signe's former beau, sizzling with jealousy, breaks the truce and makes it appear that Hagbard was responsible. The young prince escapes, but returns disguised as a woman to his beloved Signe. Thanks to a treacherous handmaiden, both lovers are imprisoned and sentenced to be hanged. Rather than undergo this final ignominy, Hagbard and Signe enter into a suicide pact. A Danish/ Swedish/ Icelandic coproduction, Hagbard and Signe was released throughout Scandinavia as Den Rode Kappe, Den Rodda Kappan and Rautha Skikkjan.",

         "I saw this picture in 1967 in Greenwich Village in NYC and was thrilled by its vigor, and what seemed to be verisimilitude to the time and place (12th century Norway?). The duel on the beach with the steaming horses nostrils, the wolf hunt with the wolfhounds trapping the wolf in his lair, the blood feud, the plotting German knight, the attraction and beauty of the young lovers, and the tragic climax -- all are so memorable and alive in my memory after all these years. My vote is based on an old experience, and I would like to see this wonderful picture again (on DVD). Its possible my evaluation might change after the passage of almost 40 years. PASMITH-4'S ROOMMATE, Frederick",
         "Dynamic Viking action, stunning cinematography, superb direction, and fine performances bring this love story, often compared to \"Romeo and Juliet\" by international critics, to a brilliant realization. An artistic triumph well-deserving of a new 21st century life on video or DVD! I would LOVE to own a copy!",
         ".....then by all means let me know directly at the above e-mail address so that I may arrange for a copy for you. While battling Norsemen impale and decapitate each other (pretty graphic for '67!) in bloody seaside duels, clan patriarch Gunnar Bjornstrand ('The Seventh Seal') worries that his beloved daughter is getting a little too sweet on a splendid blond beast from the wrong side of the \"tracks,\" and so the plot thickens as that inevitable, classic tragedy awaits. The original version of this forgotten wonder has been hailed as one of the greatest exponents of 'medieval cinema.\" And despite some campy dubbing ('That was a good blow you gave me last night') and faded color, the domestic version's retention of the Cinemascope format helps one imagine what an awesome experience it must've been to see director Gabriel Axel's unspoiled foreign cut (btw, 20 years later Axel enjoyed major international acclaim with 'Babette's Feast').",
         "\"When will the killing end\" and \"A moment of your love\" really made my tears fall out, listening to the lyrics and how it relates to the film. I loved the film because it is so much like Romeo and Juliet. I just love tearjerkers. The scenery was really breathtaking. The only complaint I have is the part when Hagbard kills 2 men in Signe's bedroom. I couldn't help laughing. It is so corny how the sword goes right through in a matter of seconds with no blood oozing out and the victims' short fake cries. The overlapping of the lovers' faces at the end with \"A moment of your love\" was so dramatic. To me that was the best part of the movie. I kept pushing the << button on my DVD player. I enjoyed this movie so much more because I have the LP soundtrack,although I don't even have a record player. Every time the tree that appears on the cover of the LP soundtrack, it seemed like the most symboolic view because (that's where they kiss and the red mantle will hang at the end). Surprisingly there was a love scene; I was really shocked that Signe appeared topless and she stood around totally nude in the fighting scenes.",
         "This film is similar to Icelandic sagas such as _Njal's Saga_ or _The Lord of the Rings_. It's been thirty years since I've seen it, but I remember that the photography was beautiful and that the film remained \"true\" to the saga tradition. I would welcome the opportunity to see it again."

      "plotSummary": "The mountain slopes of Iceland are shown to excellent advantage in the Scandinavian epic Hagbard and Signe. The story, based on an ancient legend, concerns Hagbard (Oleg Vidov), the son of a slain Norse king. Seeking revenge against the rival clan responsible for the killing, Hagbard calms down long enough to establish a truce. He also falls in love with Signe (Gitte Haenning), daughter of his onetime enemy. Signe's former beau, sizzling with jealousy, breaks the truce and makes it appear that Hagbard was responsible. The young prince escapes, but returns disguised as a woman to his beloved Signe. Thanks to a treacherous handmaiden, both lovers are imprisoned and sentenced to be hanged. Rather than undergo this final ignominy, Hagbard and Signe enter into a suicide pact. A Danish/ Swedish/ Icelandic coproduction, Hagbard and Signe was released throughout Scandinavia as Den Rode Kappe, Den Rodda Kappan and Rautha Skikkjan.",
