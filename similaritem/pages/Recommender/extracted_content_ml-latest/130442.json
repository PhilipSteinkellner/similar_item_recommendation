         "The nurse Kathy Jacquard (Sharni Vinson) travels to an isolated psychiatric clinic seeking a new job to forget her former boyfriend Ed Penhaligon (Damon Gameau). She is interviewed by the chief of the nurses Matron Cassidy (Rachel Griffiths) and by Doctor Roget (Charles Dance) and he asks Cassidy to hire her. Kathy befriends Nurse Williams (Peta Sergeant) that introduces her friend Brian Wright (Martin Crewes) to her. Kathy feels attracted by the comatose patient Patrick (Jackson Gallagher), who is the guinea pig in cruel and unethical experiments of Dr. Roget. She also learns that Patrick actually feels the external stimulus inflicted by Dr. Roget. Further she finds a means to communicate with Patrick and soon she discovers that he has the power of telekinesis. Kathy decides to help Patrick that becomes obsessed for her. Patrick uses his ability to harm and kill everyone close to Kathy and she realizes that he is an evil threat that must be destroyed. Will it be possible? \"Patrick\" is an average horror movie with a story that entwines a mad scientist in a hospital with telekinesis. The plot recalls those movies from the 70's and 80's and I found that it is a remake of an unknown 1978 Australian flick. This movie entertains but is absolutely forgettable. My vote is five. Title (Brazil): \"Patrick, O Despertar do Mal\" (\"Patrick, The Awakening of the Evil\")",
         "Saw this in it's limited run in Melbourne. The movie is quite strange and has just the right amount of creepy to keep you entertained for the entire running time, but I feel this should've added a prequel element to make the obsessiveness work better. The acting was great, and the film is pretty average, but if you are into these psychological films than you'd probably enjoy it more than I did. Sharni Vinson is great as the leading lady and new nurse at the hospital, and she always has this believability about her which is great. Rachel Griffiths was also fantastic as the head nurse and every time she popped up you wanted to find out what the deal is with her being so cold and black hearted.",
         "Low budget Australian affair about an obscure and remote mental \"hospital\" whose star patient, Patrick, forges a bloody bond with new smart and able but unsuspecting nurse Kathy Jacquard (Sharni Vinson). The opening prologue seems to promise another predictably lame slasher flick, and the entire film is a little slow to develop, yet the last half-hour or so entails some interesting and creative layers and twists. This film becomes a lot more distinct once we get to know Patrick's story. Decent all-around acting, with good performances by the three women who play the nurses: Vinson, Rachel Griffiths, and Peta Sergeant. It seems the makers were trying to create a circa 1950 Gothic horror film set in the age of GPS with modern horror tropes (something like that). A valiant attempt, but PATRICK would have been better if it were more consistently modern. Many of the props (nurses' uniforms, etc) look unrealistically antiquated, and the outside views of the hospital. . .well, you can tell it's not an actual building. The constant rubber stamp suspense symphony soundtrack also gets a little annoying--There's just no need for it except in a few select spots. All the same, none of the various weaker points should get too much in the way if you're a big horror fan. Some brief \"incidental\" nudity and a fair measure of really nasty-gory death and dismemberment. Still, PATRICK makes good use of its gore, using it briefly and shockingly.",
         "I don't know why so many filmmakers fail to grasp the concept that sometimes less is more. This remake of \"Patrick\" is a good example. The whole movie has an amateurish look, simply due to the use of a color filter to give it a 'dark', 'greyish' atmosphere. It just looked ridiculously fake. As did the rain filter, the CGI lift shaft shot, the car headlights and so on. Editing was terrible too. As a matter of fact, everything about this movie was bad, the exception being Pino Donaggio's score (which was not great either, but at least acceptable). As for the cast, Charles Dance does what he can, but the poorly written screenplay does not help things much. And don't even get me started on the final jump 'scares'...",
         "If the ending would have been better, the grade would of certainly be above 6. Now it has a 5, maybe it will go down a little in time, but don't think it will drop under 4.7 because it is a movie that delivers some scares, some thinking, good acting, focusing more on the plot than killshots. Looks a lot like \"Freakdog\" 2008, but a level over it, that one showing more torture kills than creating a deeper, more complex plot like we have here. Some nude scenes even and lovely ones too, some jump scares, few and little, but enough to remind you, you're watching a horror, some points gained from the fact that they ended the movie instead of prolonging it to a small infinity. So all in all, 5 is just the grade for \"Patrick\", could have been better, huge potential, very good atmospheric shots throughout the movie, very dark and moody, but still, 2014 shows that horror are not made like they used to. I recommend it for a late night, especially during a storm. Cheers!",
         "\"Patrick\" is a remake of the classic 1978 film of the same name. This updated telling of the somber, clinical horror is directed by Mark Hartley and stars Charles Dance, Rachel Griffiths, Sharni Vinson, Peta Sergeant, Damon Gameau, Martin Crewes. \"Patrick\" is the story of a young man in a coma who is the subject of a mad scientist's cruel and unusual experiments. When Kathy Jacquard, a young nurse, begins working at the isolated psychiatric facility under Dr. Roget, she becomes fascinated with Patrick and soon the comatose man begins showing signs of supernatural abilities. The story in \"Patrick\" is a really dark, nefarious tale of mad science and extreme circumstance. \"Patrick\" takes on the most colorful of urban myths where cold, calculative doctors explore scientific discovery and notoriety at the behest of the helpless patient. It is the core of most nightmares surrounding hospitals, clinics and mental institutions. So \"Patrick\" is a story that should please any horror fan. This film offers the same evenly-paced melancholy with a bit of unease as the classic version, but the updated look and feel give more edge to the film. There isn't a big change to the story or situations in this remake generally speaking which normally would make a remake pointless and boring but with \"Patrick\" there is still that creepy, since of dread and chilling coldness that the original film held. The acting in \"Patrick\" is pretty standard for a film with a nice enough budget. The actors are all well known from various other ventures and their ability to give life to the characters shows on screen. This film doesn't demand to much depth or complexity of character and the director doesn't offer anymore than what the original story called for which works but at times kind of gives the film that whole \"going through the motions\" sort of vibe. Still the actors offer believable, solid performances and the dramatic overture to their interactions presents a traditional macabre performance. The special effects and soundtrack used in \"Patrick\" is tight, much like the acting, with plenty of creative gruesomeness. The kill scenes aren't as visceral as most modern horror films tend to be but they work and offer enough blood-n-guts goodness to satisfy. The suspense isn't really as strong as I would have like, especially considering it is a remake of such a notable cult classic. Maybe cause I saw the original more than once this film just seemed like a \"basic\" update which isn't saying anything bad about it, it just would have been nice to see the extra effort made to shock and thrill those of us who where familiar with the original-offer a modern, fresh atmosphere of fright. The soundtrack is eerie enough but still much like the shock factor it doesn't really heighten the suspenseful nature or chilling overcast of the film. That being said \"Patrick\" is an entertaining, creepy film that manages to breathe new life in a horror story classic.",
         "One needs to see both the original 1978 movie and the 2013 version to appreciate the links between the 2 movies. The opening shot of the Franklin Institute was in fact the hospital which appeared in the 1978 version. Throughout the movie, Roget listens to the Brian May score from the 1978 movie in his earphones. Rod Mullinar (Ed in 1978) is now Morris, Roget's boss. Maria Mercedes (Nurse Panicale in 1978) is now the Doctor treating Ed's burns. Ed Jacquard is now renamed Ed Penhaligon. (Susan Penhaligon played the 1978 Kathy Jacquard). In 2013 Patrick's surname is Thompson. (Robert Thompson played the original Patrick). After Brian's hand is cut by the shattering wine glass he goes to Emergency at the Royal Helpmann Base Hospital. (Robert Helpmann played the 1976 Roget). The pace and editing in the 2013 movie is fast, tight and at times frenetic. Coupled with Donaggio's full-on score and the overall production, set and lighting design we are at all times drawn into and often confronted by the bizarre, visually explicit elements making this almost a homage to the \"grande guignol\". A delightfully fun movie, particularly for those familiar with Antony Ginnane's original treatment of the work.",
         "I never saw the original one so I can only review this one without comparison. I see that the first one gets much more stars so I might watch that one as well in the future because I already liked this remake. The whole movie was not boring at all like many other horror movies. Instead I thought the storyline was well intriguing and it keeps the audience interested during the whole movie. All the actors were fine to me, nobody bothered me at all. Charles Dances as doctor Roget gave a good performance as usual. The music and sound was perfect for the suspense. Definitely a good horror/thriller to watch on a cold dark evening.",
         "I liked the horror film Patrick very much, but its remake, Patrick: Evil Awakens, is a very entertaining film on its own merits, so I didn't need a \"nostalgic filter\" to enjoy it. The first thing I have to say is that Patrick: Evil Awakens is that it mustn't be taken very seriously, because its impulsive narrative freely flows between the solemnity and the satire, emulating '70s horror cinema with a beautiful cinematography, sinister architecture and bombastic music, not to mention the over the top drama from the last 20 minutes, when big secrets are revealed and serious decisions are taken in the middle of violent murders and experiments from a mad scientist. In summary, a film which is difficult to classify, but easy to appreciate because of the enthusiasm and dedication with which it was made. And then, we have solid performances from most of the cast, starting by Sharni Vinson, who had left me astonished as the \"final girl\" from You're Next. In Patrick: Evil Awakens, she brings another credible and enthusiastic work. Charles Dance brings a perfect performance as the twisted genius, giving him a subtext of emotional instability which makes him more frightening than any prosaic villain who is motivated by his mere evilness. The only weak spot of the cast is Damon Gameau, who feels a bit insipid and listless as the gallant. Another negative element is the implementation of a few totally digital scenes which feel a bit out of place in a film which is so respectful of the '70s aesthetic. Nevertheless, I found Patrick: Evil Awakens a very competent remake, and I enjoyed it pretty much, so I consider it worthy of a recommendation.",
         "\"Patrick\" was actually a rather interesting movie. Having read the synopsis and seen that Charles Dance was in this movie, then it just seemed like the type of horror movie that you need to watch. The storyline in the movie is what makes \"Patrick\" interesting, because it does have some nice aspects to it. Now, the movie wasn't particularly scary as per se, but there was a fulfilling storyline that was coherent and well-thought through. There was something dark and brooding to the entire movie, perhaps it was the atmosphere of the old house that the movie was shot it. I don't know. But it worked out quite nicely. The story in \"Patrick\" is about nurse Kathy (played by Sharni Vinson) who comes to work for Dr. Roget (played by Charles Dance) and his daughter Cassidy (played by Rachel Griffiths) at a secluded house where the doctor is running unauthorized and experimental treatments on comatose and braindead patients, trying to bring life back into their minds. The patient Patrick turns out to harbor a dark secret that quickly puts Kathy in a life or death situation. I will say that the people on the cast list were doing good jobs, and the characters were really nicely portrayed and detailed, which really helped the movie along quite nicely. However, I was missing more scares and generally a more spooky movie, and as such then I am rating \"Patrick\" a 5 out of 10 stars."
