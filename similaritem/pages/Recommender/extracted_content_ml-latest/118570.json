         "So first off, this isn't really a sequel. It shares some themes with jarhead and its about Marines, but the storyline is completely unrelated and has a lot more action. This is a relatively low budget attempt at a great war action/drama and although the writing lacks a lot of polish, the combat scenes are okay, the camera work is okay and the actors all seem to be doing their best with the clunky dialogue. The storyline itself isn't very original but again, its okay. The film follows a Corporal who is considering leaving the Marines and explores ptsd, survivors guilt, etc. basically war is hell but it forms great bonds. Again, this isn't done exceptionally well but it does keep the movie from becoming a brainless action movie and brings a sense of drama to the film. As a sequel to Jarhead this movie fails, but as a standalone action/drama flick it's actually fairly enjoyable.",
         "If you are just seeking Hollywood action this is right up your ally. If your'e like me and wanted something realistic and a true military movie then move on. This movie has so many military errors it aggravated me more than entertained me. There were scenes where Marines ranks were not on their uniform. A corporal was called sir constantly throughout the film. They fired an M203 grenade at a taliban member no more than 20m away and it exploded when it hit the man. These grenades are made to not detonate that close. Also the fact that they wasted the 40mm grenade on a single man instead of blowing up the truck with a machine gunner in it was far from realistic. Also an RPG was fired and supposedly exploded the entire building they were in and set it on fire and only the one man that the grenade hit directly died, not the Marine three feet from him. Lastly, the weapons the Marines had were fully automatic M4 and M16 platforms and while they do exist they are not used by US Military. This movie was made for people that just wanted action without any realistic backing. It isn't a bad story it just was not done with the accuracy that should be expected. I didn't have too high of expectations but I was still let down.",
         "The title for this film, \"Jarhead 2: Field of Fire\", appears to be very poorly chosen. This is because it really isn't a sequel to \"Jarhead\" and you certainly don't need to have seen this prior film to appreciate this new movie. On its own, it's an exceptional film and I strongly recommend it. And, if you didn't know it, a jarhead is a nickname for US Marines--and it's a name they often call each other. The film is about a small group of soldiers serving in Afghanistan. Oddly, despite this war having lasted well over a decade, very few movies have really talked about it. This picture is a tribute to the American and Afghan soldiers fighting against the Taliban--and it makes its point very personally. Now I know some people reading this have very strong feelings for and against this war--I myself have very mixed feelings. But you cannot help but admire the courage of the individuals willing to risk their lives after you see this film no matter what your views on the war might be. And the film manages to praise and honor them without being jingoistic or overtly political. As I watched \"Jarhead 2\", I really wish I could have seen the film with some soldiers who actually have served in Afghanistan to get their insights into the realism of the project. To me, it looked insanely real--about as real and scary as any war picture can be. Although the movie was filmed in Bulgaria, it managed to look pretty much like what I expected Afghanistan to look like. And, the soldiers seemed very professional and believable--like real soldiers. Now for some, this is a problem. To make the film realistic, the film is very bloody. Additionally, like real soldiers, the actors in this film TALK like soldiers--crude, sexually suggestive and totally inappropriate for small kids and the easily offended. However, this DID make the film seem very real, as the soldiers I've known sounded just like these young men and women. Because of all this, the film easily earns its R rating--but I still encourage you to see it. After all, war is so detached from most of us. We see a few reports on TV but really have little idea of the sacrifice or hell these folks go through--and the film is probably about as close as we can get to knowing what it's like to be on the front lines without actually going there. Having unfamiliar faces instead of familiar actors only adds to this effect. The film has a very simple plot. A convoy is taking supplies to another location when they happen upon a couple US Navy Seals who are trying to escort a local woman to safety. Why, exactly, she is with them is something you learn later in the film. However, the rescue of the Seals and the woman is NOT the end of their problems--it's only the beginning. Soon the caravan is set upon by Taliban fighters and many of the soldiers and all of the vehicles are destroyed. How can the few remaining stragglers possibly escape now that they are trapped behind enemy lines? This film is very, very tense and personal. The fighting looks very real, the actors appear to bleed and die before your eyes and the film is not pretty, as war is not pretty. This makes the movie tough viewing and certainly isn't for everyone. However, I do strongly recommend the film for many reasons. First, war SHOULD be shown as personal and bloody and awful because it is! While I love old films, the sanitized version of war we got in the 1940s and 50s films from Hollywood made it all seem very 'nice' and Jarhead 2 strips away the myth. Second, although I assume this is a relatively low budget film (despite being released by Universal), you certainly can't tell. The writing, acting and sets all look great and seem real. They certainly got a lot for the money they spent to make this film. Third, I hate that most folks almost always go just to the big-budgeted mega-movies. Many of these films are quite formulaic and the studios don't need your money. Instead, consider spending it on a film that is high quality and gripping from start to finish and which doesn't star Johnny Depp, George Clooney or Angelina Jolie. I have nothing against these actors, but sometimes a film can achieve even more without a big name in the film and \"Jarhead 2\" actually is a first-rate film. As always, I'd love to hear from you about the movie. Especially if you are a serviceman or servicewoman, I'd love to know your thoughts--both positive and negative.",
         "a lot of stupid things the first thing is the language they are using some of Arabic terms frequently especially when gunfire , In Afghanistan do not speak Arabic so where did you come from this speech ?! Even when he was praying did not pray correctly LOL ! the second thing is the effects ,,, it was so bad like \"RPJ\" at the beginning of the movie and when the house was destroyed Marines still alive in the house and Taliban get in the house don't kill any one ,,, What a stupid !! The third thing is when they escaped by car did not face any problems ,,, escaped from a Taliban stronghold with such ease ? nice story but unfortunately a lot of stupid !",
         "I enjoyed the first 'Jarhead' film and was curious as to what any 'sequel' would be like. However, at least I kept my expectations low as I knew this was not produced by the same cast or crew as the first, plus part II was released straight-to-DVD, so, how good could it be? The answer... quite good actually, but only as a generic war film, rather than a sequel. Okay, so occasionally the film mimics the original in style (think captions, mainly near the beginning) and it uses the term 'jarhead' a couple of times, but that's about it. In fact... I'm running out of other things that link the two films. So, the best thing to do is basically just ignore everything you know about the first movie and go with what's on offer. And, what's on offer is a war movie set in modern Afghanistan. A small team of marines (or 'jarheads' to be precise) are on a routine mission, only to find themselves forced to protect an important female local as she travels across arguably one of the most dangerous regions in the world. Bottom line: if you like war films, you'll probably enjoy this. It's actually got a half reasonable budget and doesn't feel too much like a straight-to-DVD movie.",
         "\"Keep the faith - Semper Fi.\" Chris Merrimete (Kelly) has just been promoted. Even though he isn't sure how much longer he will stay enlisted he picks his unit and they head out on a mission to resupply an outpost through Taliban controlled territory. Along the way they come upon what is left of a SEAL team and an Afghan woman whom they were extracting. When things go from bad to worse the mission becomes protecting this woman for reasons unknown to the marines. Like many of you when I saw Jarhead 2 my first thought was, oh no, not another direct to video sequel. There have been a ton of these and none have been good. Behind Enemy Lines is on their 4th one, Death Race has 3, Joy Ride has 3...the list goes on and on. Sitting down to watch this I had very low expectations. I don't often get surprised by movies but this one did. I was really shocked at how good this one was and I really enjoyed it. On the other hand though this is nothing like the original at all. The original dealt with the mental aspect of going through training and heading to a place they don't want to be and having nothing to do. This one is more of a straight action/war movie, and this was actually one of the better war movies that have come out recently. Overall, a movie that was much better then I was expecting and I ended up really liking it. I surprisingly give this a B+.",
         "I recently got a chance to see this at a screening and it is surprisingly excellent. I say surprisingly because I never expect too much from a film I know isn't going to be released in theaters, so I figured it would be another addition to the saturated war film DVD market. Not at all. It reminded me a lot of the slow tension builds of The Hurt Locker and Lone Survivor, where the audience knows action is coming, but the character build up allows us to care about the team members who come under fire once the fighting begins. The actors are all quite good, with a special nod given to Bokeem Woodbine, Danielle Savre and Cole Hauser. The team has a great rapport and the humor is sprinkled in in appropriate doses. While not all of the jokes are hit their mark exactly, the lines delivered by Woodbine are laugh out loud funny, which helps lighten the mood in a film that has an incredible amount of heart. Well done all around, and proof that not all great films make it to the big screen.",
         "Oh boy, here we go again. The Hollywood military action movie of the year, and the writers on this 'movie' just spat in the face of The movie Jarhead and everyone involved with that story by even having the same name as it. Where Jarhead showed the flip side of deployment, the stir crazy of waiting, the fear of the unknown, the boredom. This is just another attempt at cashing in of something that worked before. It seem to me that the writers watched The Hurt locker and thought it was a great movie, anyone in the military will tell you other wise, and said to themselves \"We can do a movie like this, but let's use marines so we can call it Jarhead 2: fields of fire.\" I could not get more than 20 minutes through it, and the only reason I wanted to watch it was to see how many mistakes I could find, there are a lot. I'm not going to list any, as there are plenty in other reviews. The main thing about this film is that it is almost like the writers just googled stuff about the military and picked and chose what sounded cool, not knowing anything behind how things really work in the military, like no one in the military says \"request permission to do�\" or \"request permission to speak freely\". It's low budget and there is no deeper theme or story behind the action. This is the Marines version of the Hurt Locker",
         "I recently just saw this movie and overall I would give it five out of ten stars because overall it was a decent film not perfect but decent. There are many different reasons why I gave this film a five out of ten. War movies are definitely one of my favorite genres of movies but this movie is definitely not one of the best war movies. This movie lacks a lot of realism it is not as realistic as some other films. I am not going to share any spoilers but this movie can be very unrealistic at times. I would say that this movie is definitely better than the first Jarhead because it had a lot more action. This movie is focused mostly around combat while the first film gets more in depth into the lives of the characters. But in this movie you don't learn that much about the characters lives and you have to try to figure out many different things about each characters personality. This movie also has many different action scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat but there should be more. I definitely have seen better War films like Saving Private Ryan and Full Metal Jacket. But I will definitely remember this film as a great story about a group of Marines.",
         "When I first saw that there was going to be a sequel to Jarhead I already felt disappointed, I was a huge fan of the first movie and did not feel it ever needed a sequel. Hearing that it was action in this movie made me even worse as one of the main themes of the first Jarhead was the lack of action. However I must say after watching this I would say I was pleasantly surprised and do not feel it soiled the Jarhead name like one of those sequels that makes fans pretend it never happened. It started off slow and uninteresting. I thought the main character himself was quite underdeveloped but once this movie gets going you do start to care for these characters. I think the main character could have been a lot more human than just being a marine as I couldn't relate to him. Warning lots of Hu-Rah's and Hell Yea's. The script itself could have done with a little more polishing with some scenes feeling they could have had more of an impact but there is some intense scenes in this movie which is what I like in an action movie. There was one or two cliché moments but aside from that this was a pretty strong movie. It carried some important messages about how bad situations build great bonds. It also has the sort of Saving Private Ryan \"How can one person be so important\" cliché. It still pulls it off though. So go into this with an open mind unlike me. Go in and just have a good time with this. I personally don't mind if more Jarhead movies come out now as long as they all carry different messages and they are made to be stand alone movies."

      "plotSummary": "Battle-scarred and disillusioned by the war, Corporal Chris Merrimette is put in charge of a unit whose next mission is to resupply a remote outpost on the edge of Taliban-controlled territory. While driving through the hostile Helmand province, a Navy SEAL flags down their convoy and enlists the unit on an operation of international importance: they must help an Afghan woman famous for her defiance of the Taliban escape the country. Without tanks or air support, Merrimette and his team will need all the courage and firepower they can muster to fight their way across the war-torn country and shepherd the woman to safety.",
