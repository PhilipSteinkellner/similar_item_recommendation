      "reviews": [
         "Even after 63 years of independence India is still in the strong grip of religious superstition and many medieval prejudices. The caste system runs deep in the society and often determines person's identity. Daily newspapers run a dedicated section on astrology, alternate medicines like Homeopathy gets millions of dollars in government funding, the Nation is more opinionated on religious issues than on real issue like poverty and education and all these happens under the active support and promotion from the educated urban middle class contrary to what many would like to believe, the illiterate rural masses. The movie is a slap on the face of such so-called educated and a stark warning what could happen if religious sentiments of the people is misused or abused to achieve personal goals, a fact India would so painfully be facing within just 2 years after the release of the movie. Ray could see what is coming, and like all true artist for whom his work is more than just art and in reality a medium of communication has tried to fulfill his duties to make the people aware of what he saw was coming. It is not one of \"those\" art films, in fact there is very little art into it. Ray was very fragile while shooting his last 3 films, so most of the shots are indoor and very archaic and to the point. Despite his illness he attempted this movie to tell his fellow citizen what grave danger the Nation is facing, there one can see the other side of Ray almost as a social reformer. Unlike many others however, Ray delivered the message in a way that should hurt nobody, even though Ray himself was an atheist. The movie brings forth the eternal conflict between hard scientific fact and the opposing religious doctrine. In the movie the young generation ultimately favors science and this optimism about India that Ray has envisioned is the best part of the movie, indeed the most touching part. The screenplay is very simple and banal yet appropriate and I can't imagine it can be made any better without tipping off the scale. Dhritiman excels Soumitra but that's my opinion. The advantage of working with known and trusted crew of such stalwarts is that it takes away a lot of hardship from an exhausted director without compromising any on the quality!",
         "\"Ganashatru\" is certainly one of the best movies of Satyajit Ray, though not one of his most popular ones. The story is set up in a small town of India and is brutally realistic. The film depicts the superstitions and ignorance one might find in an Indian town (or for that matter in any Indian City). The main characters are brilliantly portrayed by Soumitra Chatterjee, Dipankar Dey, Subhendu Chatterjee and Dhritiman. The reason this movie has not had any popularity is mainly because of the blind religious superstitions that lives amongst most of us and has blinded us in seeing the truth. A must watch, if one believes that film makers have a duty towards educating the society.",
         "Ganashatru is a straightforward film that highlights the impact blind superstition can have and how superstition can be cynically misused by the administration. Dr Ashok Gupta questions the quality of the water used in the local temple and for preparing the 'charanamrit' (holy water) people drink. It hurts the religious sentiments of people whose blind faith will brook no stigma against the local temple. The businessman sees a loss of business, the bureaucrat a loss of tourist inflow and everyone is up in arms. No matter that Dr. Gupta is not against religion. No matter that he is willing to present scientific evidence. No matter that, in the past, he has been much admired by the very people who now vilify him. As the juggernaut nearly overwhelms Ray's protagonist, hope raises its head in the form of the youth who rally behind the beleaguered Dr. Gupta. Ray is clearly sending out a message against religious dogma in this film. In a way he was foretelling the strife that occurred in India barely two years after this film was released. Ray, the humanist, still sees hope, not in the old guard who profit from dogma but from among the educated youth, for they will make the country of the future. But this film is certainly not among Ray's best. In fact, together with Sakha Praskha, this film represents the nadir of Ray's great career. For a master of detail, Ray makes elementary mistakes. He forgets that Public Health is not the responsibility of the Municipal Body alone, and there is a full Health Department, whose job is to monitor such outbreaks and take remedial action. It is there in every district and small town. Dr. Gupta as the city hospital in-charge would have had regular intercourse with such officials. Ray (In the form of Dr. Gupta and his brother the Municipal Chairman) does not seem to know that small town judges cannot hear public interest litigation and that even a biased judge would need to counter scientific evidence when presented. There an numerous such small and large errors. The film moves at a very slow and stilted pace but picks up momentum towards the end. The best part of the film is the acting. Soumitra id very good, but he is overshadowed by Dhritiman Chakraborty and in some scenes by Dipankar Dey. The ladies have a limited, supportive role, but Ruma Guha Thakurata does well as the long suffering wife who stands by her husband and admires him for his ethical stand. Technically, camera work of Barun Raha is competent and not flashy. Music by Ray is wonderful as usual. Its good to see Criterion/Eclipse bringing out Ray's works. The DVD is the best available in the market, although the images could be a little sharper and there is some hiss in the audio.",
         "Ray adapts an Ibsen play. This feels very much like a made-for-TV movie, and it's a bit of a slog, especially up front, but it gains momentum as it goes on and is pretty interesting. Dr. Gupta (Soumitra Chatterjee) discovers that the holy water from a popular local temple is infected with bacteria. Fixing the problem will be costly and a lot of people are against it, including Gupta's brother (Dhritiman Chatterjee), a bureaucrat. Eventually, Dr. Gupta finds himself in deep disapproval of the community, a virtual pariah. This is part of a recently released Eclipse set, Late Ray, but can also be watched on Hulu Plus.",
         "This has to be one of Ray's lesser inspired works. He has made minimal effort to adapt the script of a play into an entertaining movie. The story, like all his movies, depicts struggle against social stigmas. But its dull. The characters fail to generate any bonding with the audience. The pace is extremely slow and the dialog stilted. This could be because Ray was cautious of the sensitive issue being dealt with in the movie. He may have deliberately presented such a clinical version to avoid a clash with the religious right. The collusion of media and bureaucracy exposed by the movie is admirable. Bottomline, I would rather watch the same performance as a play instead of the movie format."
