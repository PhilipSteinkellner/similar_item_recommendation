We get to see Liam Neeson, Patricia Clarkson and Jim \"James\" Carrey in one of their first movies.\r\n\r\nMaybe, to save, the chase scene with the remote controlled toy car.",

      "synopsis": "For San Francisco veteran police detective 'Dirty' Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood), fame catches up with him when he testifies against crime kingpin Lou Janero (Anthony Charnota) which puts Janero into prison. One night, Callahan is attacked by Janero's men at a turnoff near the San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge while driving his car. However, he knocks down one of the assasins with his car and shoots the remaining men dead before they finish their jobs. Afterwards, Dirty Harry Callahan and his new Asian-American, martial arts-skilled partner Al Quan (Evan C. Kim) are assigned to investigate the death of rock singer Johnny Squares (Jim Carrey). After slasher film director Peter Swan's (Liam Neeson) producer is killed in a Chinatown restaurant robbery which Callahan foils, Callahan discovers that he, together with Johnny Squares are part of a game in which participants try to predict the most celebrity deaths, presumably from natural causes or from those that work in dangerous professions, and in a turn of events, two more celebrities on the list are killed. Along the way Harry has to deal with the media, particularly reporter Samantha Walker (Patricia Clarkson), to balance their interference with the investigation against the public's right to know. She also proposes to do an in-depth profile on Callahan for her news report, while he wants to simply perform his job and stay out of the limelight. After one dinner meeting, they narrowly escape being killed by Janero's men in an elevator outside a restaurant, leading the reporter to reconsider the plight of police officers. The following morning, Callahan drives to the prison where Janero is serving his sentence to meet with a chain smoking inmate named Butcher Hicks (who is very large and muscular). Callahan promises Hicks a carton of Camel Un-Filtered cigarettes if he helps Callahan out. When Callahan reaches Janero's cell, he makes it clear to Janero that if something happens to him, then Butcher will pay him a visit and probably kill him (this results in Janero telling his men to make sure nothing happens to Callahan while he is on duty). Callahan helps resolve a situation where a man named Gus Wheeler (Louis Giambalvo), who is rumored to be responsible for the murders, tries to burn himself to get on the news so people will know the real him. In the end, it turns out that the real killer is a deranged fan of Swan, named Harlan Rook (David Hunt) who thinks all of his ideas and work have been stolen by Swan. It is also known that Swan had filed a restraining order against Rook a year before. Next morning, Callahan and Quan are pursued through San Francisco's hilly streets in an unmarked squad car by a remote controlled bomb assembled by Rook, disguised as a radio controlled car. The bomb explodes, nearly killing Quan who survives due to his bulletproof vest. Meanwhile, Rook, disguised as Swan, calls Walker at the television station to Swan's film studio to give her an interview, which is actually a trap. Soon after, Rook's home is raided by the police and torn posters of Swan's films are found. Callahan then drives to Swan's film studio where Walker is held captive by Rook. Callahan reluctantly surrenders his .44 Magnum revolver to Rook when he nearly slits her throat. Walker and Callahan escape and Callahan lures him to a pier after a chase. Rook, who has run out of bullets, is shot by Callahan with a harpoon, killing him instantly. As the film ends, Walker and Callahan are leaving the pier, while the police are arriving at the scene.",

         "Having just seen Dead Pool, the last of the Dirty Harry series, I have to say that I enjoyed this film as much as the other four. I don't have a favorite, I loved them all. Recently I became interested in Clint Eastwood's films and have seen a number of them including the westerns. Eastwood is an amazing guy. He has presence on the screen that is extraordinary. It's not that he is such a great actor, but I can't take my eyes off of him when he is in a scene. His face conveys such hysterical expression when he comes out with, \"Swell!\" or \"Marvelous!\" He's irreverent, gritty, rude, shoots criminals in the back, beats the sh-t out of them, antagonizes everyone, and so what. He gets the job done! I liked everyone in the cast even Patricia Clarkson and her nasal voice. Liam Neeson was great, sounding for all the world exactly like Ralph Fiennes. And the music in all five of the series was terrific -the best! What a treat!",
         "Dirty Harry still has it. This film has all the mayhem, the violence, the wisecracks, the whole formula. Patricia Clarkson's delicate beauty is a good counterpoint to Eastwood's ruggedness. It was interesting to see actors like Neeson and Carrey paying their dues. When I first saw this film, I didn't realize that the \"car chase\" scene, running from the toy Corvette, was a spoof of Bullitt, but on viewing this time, I found the homage hilarious. No, this film isn't the equal of \"Dirty Harry\" but it's not bad at all for a fourth sequel.",
         "This was the fifth and last \"Dirty Harry\" movie with Clint Eastwood playing the hero again, Inspector Harry Callahan, cleaning up the streets of San Francisco from all the scumbag criminals. I've always found \"The Dead Pool\" to be one of his best in this series. It's entertaining with pretty taut suspense and always fun to go back and see a young Jim Carrey. It's always cool, too, to watch those little remote-control cars with bombs attached go speeding through the streets underneath automobiles. At an hour-and-a-half, there are no dry spots in this film, either. The female lead, Patricia Clarkson, is not one of my favorites. Eastwood seems to like those skinny blonds. Evan Kim, playing \"Harry's\" new partner, \"Al Quan,\" was a likable guy. Even Harry's slightly more low-key in this movie, his language more tame and he gets in a few comedic zingers as well. Carrey plays a totally-despicable drugged-out rock star but he doesn't last long in the film. Carry and Liam Neeson play low-life people and combine to put some sleaze into the story. Despite the usual less-than-credible action scenes at the end (where the villains miss from point-blank range, etc.), this is still a very entertaining movie and one of my favorites among the \"Dirty Harry\" films. Clint went out in style with this film.",
         "This was altogether too simple for the critics back in '88 -- the whole idea was to point the barrel of the joke right back at the criticism. Whereas the previous Dirty Harry features sat on a platform of utter contempt for bureaucrats and political correctness, here it's expanded to contempt for journalists, and especially the subspecies of 'media critics'. As if they couldn't make it clearer, a 'movie critic' is murdered, and treated as an occurrence of 'death of celebrities by threes'. Yes, this is explicitly about movie making; the previous four movies suffered from poor supporting casts that only got in the way of the narrative. Here Van Horn deliberately employs good actors to play bad genre roles and thus turns the series on its head. Along the way, we get a nice comment on \"Bullitt\", this time deflating the over touted car chase with a gag: an explosives laden model '63 Z06 (instead of a fastback Mustang, to drive home the point). By this time, the .44 Magnum is treated as a character, with a 'voice' that rolls off the cityscape like thunder...the bad guys run at the mere sight of it. To put the icing on the 'man with the biggest gun' motif, Clint dispatches the villain with an earlier one liner (\"you're S.O.L.\") and a movie prop harpoon. The elaborate conflation of sexual double entendre, humor and cowboy justice went soaring over many heads. Arnold wishes he was half this funny in \"Last Action Hero\". Ah, we miss Harry...but his retirement to Carmel was both serendipitous and necessary. By the end of this, he's killed off every cartoon bad guy left in the movie universe, paving the way for both the dimensional villains of \"Die Hard\" and its ilk, AND the hosannas bestowed on \"Unforgiven\".",
         "While this film was just pure entertainment, at least we got to see Dirty Harry doing what we all wanted to see him do: kick some serious ass. Sure, it seemed a little odd that a 60-year old man would be kicking the buts of guys of half his age, but isn't that what film is for: to escape reality? While this is somewhere in the middle in regards to the series as a whole, one cannot contend with the idea of Harry Callahan being one of the most endearing film characters ever made. A nice send-off to say the least.",
         "Tough San Fransisco cop \"Dirty\" Harry Callahan (Eastwood) is on the trail of a psychopathic killer who is obsessed with the works of British horror film director Peter Swan (Liam Neeson). Swan has developed a macabre but harmless game called \"The Dead Pool\", in which he drew up a list of local celebrities whom he believed would all die in nasty seemingly accidental ways. These include his harshest film critic Molly Fisher (Ronnie Claire-Edwards), drug addict rockstar Johnny Squares (Jim Carrey) and Inspector Callahan himself. The demented film buff proceeds to murder the people on the list one by one in horrific ways which correspond to Swan's movies. Callahan finds himself not only tracking down this crased psychotic, but also has to contend with various attempts on his life organised by a disgruntled crime boss whom Callahan put away and a new colleague, a Chinese American karate expert called Inspector Al Quan (Evan C Kim). THE DEAD POOL is Eastwood's fifth and final incarnation as Dirty Harry to date. The series always reworked the seemingly routine premise of Callahan's unorthodox approach to police work, his dislike of workplace politics and his relationships with work colleagues. However, these are essential characteristics to the series no matter how much our film critics moan about them. A bit like how much the same old smutty seaside postcard humour is valuable to the Carry On films. If the filmmakers abandoned them they would lose out at the box office. THE DEAD POOL in itself has all the characteristics of it's predecessors and the action is plentiful and Eastwood is superb as always in one of his most famous roles. One of the best set-pieces involves a car chase through the streets of San Francisco with Callahan and Quan being chased by no other than a radio control car, only this is more than a harmless kid's toy, it's a bomb! The film is also memorable for featuring future stars Liam Neeson (who is excellent as the arrogant filmmaker) and Jim Carrey as the ill-fated rockstar before he went into making those overblown comedies like DUMB AND DUMBER.",
         "In the final Dirty Harry movie, Inspector Callahan (Clint Eastwood) is annoyed by his new-found fame, caused by his court testimony against an important mob figure. His next case is a real winner: an obnoxious British director (Liam Neeson) has a \"dead pool\" on the set of his new horror flick. Each crew member picks ten celebrities they believe will die, and the one with the most dead celebs on their list at the end of the game is the big winner. Just one problem with this - the people on the director's list start dying at an alarming rate and mysteriously, including his leading man. And guess whose name is on the list as well - yeah, Harry's. If this isn't enough, a TV reporter (Patricia Clarkson) wants to do a big story on him. Directed by Buddy van Horn, \"The Dead Pool\" is a spoof of a sort, killing a movie critic as part of the story (ouch), and the story actually concerns movie-making. It also has a car chase that's a take-off on \"Bullitt.\" The stereotypical characters found in this type of film are played by some excellent actors, and there's plenty of sexual innuendo to go around. Someone mentioned that Eastwood seems a little old here for Dirty Harry. He seems old for just about every role he plays, frankly, but he keeps playing them. It's always amazing how men are able to do this with no problem, but give the man his due. He's a great presence, and in 1988, his best work as both a director and an actor was yet to come! Very entertaining and well-acted. If you can get the joke, you'll enjoy it all the more.",
         "Warning: Contains spoilers The \"Dirty Harry\" series ends with a whimper thanks to a weak ending. Why conceal the identity of the killer when he turns out to be a subsidiary character who is built into the story in the last half hour? Patricia Clarkson makes for a bland leading lady (despite a knockout figure) and has little chemistry with Eastwood. So, placing her in jeopardy creates no suspense. Also, having Harry surrender his legendary sidearm doesn't fit well with previous installments, since he has a clear head shot with the killer. Finally, having Harry find the harpoon gun shown in a previous scene is just a little too incredible. Buddy Van Horn, as a director, is no Eastwood, but he does a pretty good job. Most of the stunts are quite good and the cinematography is excellent. Lalo Schifrin's score is bouncy, but forgettable. Too bad, as a little script reworking would have made for a very good \"Dirty Harry\" effort. As it is, however, \"The Dead Pool\" is the weakest of the \"Dirty Harry\" series.",
         "To be fair, the movie has a lot going for it. The movie paces well, it didn't get boring. The plot is pretty fun. It's great to see a younger Liam Neeson and Jim Carrey. The misdirection of the audience is enjoyable. Harry's romantic interest in this movie doesn't feel right. She doesn't come across as the type of woman that would interest him. But she plays a small enough role that it doesn't bug me much. His new partner is hilariously stereotypical, and that is a pretty big wink at the audience. But what bugs me is that Harry no longer even tries to act like a cop. In the first five minutes, he shoots two attackers in the head, and shoots a fleeing attacker in the back, killing him. When he finishes off the villain at the end, the villain is out of ammo, and Harry acknowledges this. Then Harry kills him. A guy that he knows has been diagnosed with mental problems. Harry was fairly heroic during the other four movies, to varying degrees. In this one, he's not a good guy anymore. He's just bloodthirsty.",
         "'Dirty' Harry Callahan has finally brought top mobster Lou Genaro to justice and seen him sent to jail. The side effect of this high profile case is that he has become something of a media favourite \u0096 the 'hard nosed cop who brought down the mob'. Sadly, Genaro doesn't see it the same way and puts a price on Harry's head, attracting all manner of hit men. As a result of this, Harry's celebrity status also means he gets involved in 'the dead pool' a game where players list celebs who will they reckon will die by a specified date. An innocent enough game but somebody has gotten hold of one of the player's lists and is killing them off one by one. Of course the main suspect is the player himself \u0096 director Peter Swan, but Harry suspects it is someone else; but can he stay alive long enough to find out who? Watching it now in 2004, I did wonder whether or not Callahan's rather rough form of justice would wash today (shooting bad guys in the back etc) and in a way I suppose that depends on your own politics, but as a film this stands up as well as it did back in the late eighties. Of course this is not saying much because the film was never much cop (pardon the pun) and even if it had dated badly, the effects of time could not be used to explain away an average plot, some silly action and a film that is driven by its star's personality rather than anything else. The plot is simple enough but it gets things like Genaro thrown in (to pad out running time), not to mention a completely unnecessary red herring, which continues for about an hour after the audience have worked out that it isn't who the film wants us to think it is. For these reasons, a lot of the plot is unengaging, never dull of course but you do feel like a lot of stuff was added to make the film run longer or something like that. The action is typically tough and fans of 'Dirty' Harry's hard-line approach to criminals (judge & jury etc) will enjoy this stuff \u0096 but one has to wonder why the writers did try harder to integrate some scenes into the main story rather than throwing in the Genaro thing to (seemingly) create a few shoot outs, not to mention a robbery simply to create a few more quips and bad guys for Harry to kill. It all smells of overkill and audience pandering \u0096 claims that must surely be put out there whenever you witness Harry murder the unarmed (no bullets anyway) baddie with a massive harpoon! A car chase through the streets is fun but it needs you to be really into the film if you are going to be able to accept that a chase between a car and some tiny remote control toy. Of course the attraction for most people will be the draw of Eastwood in one of his most famous characters \u0096 playing totally on his tough personae all the way. Despite the weak material, he is allowed to do his usual stuff and he is enjoyable for that. He is pretty much the main reason to see the film and, when he is handing out justice in his own way, it is easy to forget that the narrative is all over the place to allow him to do so. Clarkson is OK in a side role but she is used to hammer home a rant about the media's obsession with violence (pot/kettle stuff) but she is good enough despite this aspect. Kim is good but underused but still quite fun as Harry's partner. Neeson has nothing to do except be a red herring and his accent is all over the place (wandering from English, Irish and American). The support cast of goons and tough guys all fall over just as they were required to do but are hardly much good although an early role for Jim Carrey is worth noting. The film is worth seeing and it will please those fans who shudder at the onset of the PC police and Harry does all the stuff we have come to expect from him. However as a film in itself the plot is padded to create 'Dirty Harry' moments outside of the story, while the main thread just doesn't really have enough to it to really engage and it is a rather average ending to a series that starting with such a bang."
