         "content": "It was a remake of the Israeli movie 'Mar Baum'. Kind of incorrect to call it a comedy movie when it is a dark comedy. Enjoyments from both the genres are different. You know it was one of the last movies of the legendary actor Robin Williams. That was not the reason for me to like it. The story begins to build on a silly reason, but it was a partially unique concept. Opens like a regular comedy and then turn over to the actual meaning for the contents it deals. Like the cancer theme movies it gets emotional in the later parts. There's no twists, but convinces the effort they had tried to end it on a high note. Sadly, it kind of depicts the actual life incident of Robin Williams. It is a great loss, I grew up watching 'Jumanji' and 'Flubber' and definitely he's going to live forever through his movies.\r\n\r\nHenry Altman is a man of impatient. He always angry at everyone for everything. It was no different one day when he decides to go see a doctor. He gets his turn after the long wait. As usual, he shows his anger at the lady doctor who just had a bad day. With a tension arise in an argument, a mistake will be made. So the adventure begins that takes us along all over the city which takes place in a 90 minutes. Like all the story, after realizing the what she had done was wrong, how it was brought into the sense for who affected by her mistake is the remaining.\r\n\r\n> **\u2018\u2018Anger is the only thing they left me.\r\n> Anger is my refuge, it's my shield. Anger is my birthright!\u2019\u2019**\r\n\r\nThe trailer itself said everything about the movie. Going for the movie without the trailer watch would be a great move, at least you will get something to enjoy. The cast was good, I mean everyone, including who came in short roles. It mainly focused on Robin Williams and Mila Kunis roles. These two characters take an adventure throughout the Brooklyn before the story comes to the conclusion. The movie was a lot better than I thought and what others said about it. It is kind of tearjerker movie. With the loss of Robin Williams in the real life, I got a little emotional to the end part. But the story was a bit let down. In the middle when the second half starts to undertake it really slows down and nothing happens in an exciting way. Frankly to say, it was an hour movie, but stretched for extra few more minutes to make comfortable for the theatre release. So that caused it to fall to a moderate pace. It should have been a short movie, though, as a feature film it kind of satisfied me. Somehow, with the nice direction and performances and places it was shot, all combined together gives an overall decent movie watching experience.\r\n\r\n7.5/10",

         "So.... the demographic for this movie is adult , probably over forty, has had to deal with ungrateful kids. works a grinding job they do not love, to support a family that has taken them for granted. If you fit any of that , this movie will entertain the crap out of you. I read the reviews , was not expecting much , i picked it because i am kinda angry most of the time... from said above. I laughed at the opening scene. and the next scene. i identified with both of the lead characters. overall, really, this movie is a roller coaster of emotion. If you get into it , it will make you laugh , and cry , it will make you hug your other and the rotten kids I found it amazingly entertaining, even the end . It is hard to write a review without spoilers , so all i really want to say is -- don't listen to the reviews on IMDb re; this movie. I don't know how this site attracts so many sour lemons, but thats the best way to describe these reviews. sour lemons. At first mila was annoying but that was the character, and she warms up. by the end you will be loving her. I don't know how anyone who watched this could call robins character boring, not that he needed to , but robin really carried this movie. from start to finish he fills the screen with unadulterated robin. in character form for the movie. he was great , and his brother , it was great acting . Very enjoyable . very moving . very funny.",
         "Robin Williams is great no matter whether he's acting the fool in a stand- up routine or whether he's playing a serious role. This one leans toward the serious side, although the movie has some really funny scenes. The one with James Earl Jones as the pawnbroker is borderline CLASSIC. Jones shows a comedic side I've never seen before -- actually had to rewind and replay that scene twice and laughed as hard every time. Not Williams' or Kunis' best roles, but definitely not a time-waster. Williams can make even the plight of a man nearing death seem funny, and Kunis is easy on the eyes no matter what role she plays. Melissa Leo is always good, and this movie is no exception. And the guy who plays her sometime-lover, Bob Dishy, is probably the most \"unknown famous actor\" in the business. I KNEW I had seen him before, so I googled his name, and found that he goes all the way back to Barney Miller. Never knew his name before, but he sure is a familiar guy.",
         "If ever there was a film destined for significant reappraisal due to real life events, this one is it. It stars Robin Williams as a dying man, given 90 minutes to live, running around acting like a crazy nut, trying, with varying degrees of success, to make amends for some of life's big mistakes. In the wake of Williams' suicide, the film takes on a life and meaning that no one involved could have imagined. There is a pre attached melancholy to proceedings as we watch Williams, playing Henry Altmann, indulge in the type of profanity laden, over the top, angry insults that we will remember him for, all with the certain knowledge that Henry's actions, like William's performance, are amongst the last things this man will do. This is more than likely the last time we will see Williams playing Williams in a film, and it is a fitting last hurrah. A performance laced with the humanity we are used to from Wiliams, but tempered by an evident weariness and more than a hint of regret, and ending on a note of melancholy. The support cast are all capable, and the third person narrative works well. the script is not quite as clever as it thinks it is, but does combine minor plot strands reasonably coherently. The film could have been helped from more time being given to Kunis' back story. Instead, the audience is given enough information about her to follow what's happening, and that's it. At the end of the film, Henry's loved ones are left, as we are, in a state of mourning, when all we can do is pay tribute, share memories, and remember with laughter a life that ended far sooner and more abruptly than we had time to process. A life that touched us in a way not evident until it was over. Angriest Man in Brooklyn, unwittingly captures what all of us were feeling on August 11 2014. And for that reason, if no other, needs to be watched.",
         "The Angriest Man In Brooklyn isn't the most perfect film. A slight copycat on the amazing Stranger Than Fiction, but not as gripping or funny! That said, considering what the late great Robin Williams goes through as his character, one can only watch in sadness and with tear-filled eyes in thinking that his passionately delivered dialogue really came from the heart as a cry for help. It is only with this unfortunate event, that you watch TAMIB with a completely different view. As a film, it passes the time and makes you think about life. It has entertaining moments, some laughs and some great performances. Its simple and worth a watch. We miss you Robin Williams.",
         "\"If you knew how much time you had what would you do?\" Henry Altmann (Williams) is a very angry man who hates everything. He has pushed his family away and isn't liked by anyone. Dr. Sharon Gill (Kunis) isn't having a good day. She is covering for someone and working with patients she doesn't know, and all that the day after her cat jumped out a window. When Henry comes in to see her he pushes her too far and she blurts out that he has 90 min to live. Henry leaves angry but quickly changes and tries to make everything right with his family before time runs out. Before I started this I was expecting something along the lines of Falling Down. While it was a little similar this one was different. Robin Williams did a good job in this but it isn't one of his better performances. He did however pull off the hard aspect of making a character that isn't nice to anyone but still had enough heart that you root for him. There is some very funny stuff in this but it doesn't make too much light of the serious situation. Overall, a good movie that is worth watching but it isn't one of Willams' best. I give it a B.",
         "I read many bad reviews of this picture and wasn't expecting much, but The Angriest Man in Brooklyn surprised me. It's a well-acted story with substance - a bittersweet tale of life as it is and life as it can be. The very strong cast included cameos by a stuttering James Earl Jones and a piggish Louis C.K. Yes, it's sentimental, but it's not sloppy about it. It's humorous without big laughs. It's quiet and subtle and altogether outstanding. It reminds us that the only normal people are the ones we don't really know. It shows us how important it is to try to be happy. Not your typical Hollywood, thank goodness. Portraying a man whose bad day has gone on for years, Robin Williams' performance is eerily grave. He is complemented by a strong cast and a simple story that makes its point. Well worth the price of the ticket, The Angriest Man in Brooklyn is a little gem.",
         "A remake of the 1997 Israeli film, The 92 Minutes of Mr. Baum, 'The Angriest Man in Brooklyn' is a fairly entertaining film, that doesn't eat your brains. 'The Angriest Man in Brooklyn' Synopsis: A curmudgeonly man is mistakenly told that he has 90 minutes to live by his doctor and promptly sets out to reconcile with his wife, brother and friends in the short time he believes he has left. 'The Angriest Man in Brooklyn' begins well & maintains a certain pace till the end. Its never spectacular, but its never too bad, either. Quite simply put -- Some of it works, some of it doesn't. Daniel Taplitz's Screenplay balances between comedy & drama, ably. Phil Alden Robinson's Direction is passable. Cinematography is good. Editing is also crisp. Performance-Wise: Robin Williams enacts 'The Angriest Man in Brooklyn', with effortless ease. The Oscar-Winning Actor doesn't miss a single beat. Mila Kunis is impressive. Peter Dinklage is superb, while Melissa Leo is her usual self. The Great James Earl Jones is hilarious in a cameo. On the whole, 'The Angriest Man in Brooklyn' is a safe bet for a one-time viewing.",
         "It is very sad to watch this movie after Robin Williams' recent passing. I could not stop thinking that the actor played himself with a limited short time to live: it was an old depressed man, not a funny great comedian we used to see. The actor's character says that he was born in 1951 and died in 2014 and it is exactly Robin Williams' life span. Another (not quite coincidental) strange thing is remaining 90 minutes of the character's life turned into almost 90 days of remaining Robin's life from the date of the film's release in May. The movie is not perfect but it teaches us not hesitate to show our love to the loved ones and not in the last minutes of our life but each and every day. I guess Robin Williams would stay with us if he was surrounded with the same love his character demonstrated in the movie.",
         "It's hard to know what to make of this film. It's rather too New York, too argumentative, and too profane for my taste. It probably succeeds on some level, but only because Hollywood sets the bar so low. It's certainly not Robin Williams's best work, nor Dan Taplitz's. It has Taplitz's usual themes of family and faith -- yet falls far short of Chaos Theory, and certainly Commandments, an absolute gem of a film. Yet it has a strange appeal. I'll certainly keep it in my library. I lived on Clement Street in San Francisco when Robin performed at some club there in the seventies. I Never did make it in to see him. In fact, I didn't even know he was there and couldn't have afforded such extravagances if I had known. Anyway, given Robin's unfortunate exit, the film has an unintended impact, leaving one feeling both melancholy and yearning for his character. But, of course, the actors were all professionals, just reading there lines. Right? The good news -- as was typical of Mr. Williams -- is that he appeared to give an actor named Mila Kunis room to shine, and she shone brightly and quite carried the film. Perhaps somewhere Robin's sitting on a cloud, looking down and shouting, \"Nice work, kid.\"",
         "I wish I would have seen this before Robin died. I think a lot of my feelings about this movie were colored by his untimely death. I tried very hard to watch it with an open mind, looking at it from the perspective that he was still alive. I failed miserably. The concept of the movie was an interesting take on an old question: what would you do if you knew you only had so much time to live? This put a whole new spin on the question, but the outcome was relatively the same. The cast was an unusual choice, in my opinion. Robin Williams was well known for being able to play a wide array of characters, from the brilliantly funny to the downright broken. This character was oddly complex. But again, maybe that's just me reading into it because of Robin's death. Ironically, one of the funniest scenes in the movie is the last scene, in which Robin's character is absent. In all, it was a fairly good movie that made me laugh and cry, and not necessarily at the points where you're supposed to laugh or cry. And it really made me miss the genius actor even more."

         "Some people have bad days. Henry Altmann (Williams) has one every day. Always unhappy and angry at the world including everyone in it, Henry sits impatiently at the doctor's office when he is finally seen by Dr. Sharon Gill (Kunis). Sharon, who is enduring her own bad day, reveals that Henry has a brain aneurysm. This news makes Henry even angrier, yelling at Sharon he demands to know how much time he has left. Faced with Henry's anger and insults, Sharon abruptly tells him he has only 90 minutes. Shocked and reeling by this news, Henry storms out of the office leaving Sharon stunned by what she has just done in a lapse of judgment. As Sharon goes on a city-wide search, Henry struggles with his diagnosis, determined to make amends with everyone he has hurt in his life.",
