         "Beautiful, sensitive, distressing. The very first feature-length film of José Pedro Goulart is a masterpiece of Brazilian cinema. Cinematography, edition, acting, screenplay, everything is perfect and above the ordinary. The images and camera angles captured for this film are amazingly innovative and audacious. The alternation between reality and his mind also worth being mentioned. The movie subject may be described as the difficulties and challenges faced by a boy with psychological problems and very dysfunctional parents. He finds in driving his father's car the path to freedom he does not have in his life. Though, the hardest challenge will come, and he lacks maturity to deal with. The only person who may make he goes on is himself.",
         "What an astonishing feast for the senses! While this coming of age story doesn't necessarily break any new grounds, it's a journey filled with striking visuals, surrealism and many allegories that show a teenager forced to enter adulthood way too prematurely. Despite the very low budget, I was astounded by how much care was put not only into the gorgeous juxtaposition of some wildly inventive sequences but also in regard to the unnerving and powerful score by Leo Henkin, which reminded me of what I experienced in Eraserhead as well as Under the Skin at times. Director José Pedro Goulart might be a newcomer, but Ponto Zero is one of the most unique and beautifully crafted films I've seen from my country and definitely a breath of fresh air! The anecdote in the beginning meshed with a formidable opening scene connects with the ending in truly profound ways that you would not expect for this type of story. Kudos to all the cast and team behind Ponto Zero and I sincerely hope seeing more experimental films like it as they're usually the ones that fascinate me the most!"
