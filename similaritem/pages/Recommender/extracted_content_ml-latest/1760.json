      "synopsis": "As the movie opens, the Spice Girls are enjoying their fame, but becoming dissatisfied with the burdens of it. The sinister owner of a newspaper, Kevin McMaxford (Barry Humphries (also known as Dame Edna Everage)) is trying to ruin their reputation in order to cash in on the headlines, and even dispatches a photographer (Richard O'Brien) to take pictures and tape recordings of the girls. Less threatening but more annoying is a film director (Alan Cumming) who with his crew stalks the band, hoping to use them as documentary subjects; at the same time, the girls' manager, Clifford, (Richard E. Grant) is fending off two over-eager Hollywood writers (George Wendt and Mark McKinney) who relentlessly pitch absurd plot ideas for a Spice Girls feature film. Throughout their busy schedule, the girls keep asking Clifford for time off to spend with Nicola (Naoko Mori),who is due to give birth soon, and to relax, but he refuses--mainly because his own boss, the cryptic and eccentric \"Chief\" (Roger Moore), won't allow it. The stress and overwork compound, culminating in a huge argument with Clifford and among the bandmates; the girls storm out, refusing to play Albert Hall. Separately, the bandmates think back on their humble beginnings, their struggle to the top, and their strengthened friendship. They reconcile, then decide to take Nicola out dancing. However, she goes into labor at the nightclub and is rushed to the hospital in the tour bus. The band stay at the hospital to provide Nicola with support, refusing to perform until after she has given birth. The next morning, the day of their Albert Hall gig, Nicola finally gives birth to a girl. As they are leaving the hospital, the girls bump into a doctor, but when Emma notices he has a camera, the girls realize the doctor is the photographer whose been stalking them in disguise. The photographer runs off with the girls in hot pursuit, only to hit his head on the wall after colliding with an empty stretcher, and when he sees the girls standing over him, he tells them that they've made him see the error of his ways, and he goes after the owner of the newspaper. After noticing their bus driver (Meat Loaf) missing, Victoria decides to drive herself. So, it becomes a race against time as she drives like a maniac to get to Albert Hall. The bus drives by Buckingham Palace, the the girls wave to the Royal Family, Victoria puts her foot down on the gas pedal when Tower Bridge starts to go up to let a boat through. They land safely on the other side, but when Emma opens a trapdoor in the floor, she discovers a bomb! The girls finish the movie with a performance of \"Spice Up Your Life\".",

         "When I was seven and this movie came out, it was the biggest thing around. Everyone wanted to be the Spice Girls. After they split up and weren't cool anymore, everyone forgot about the movie. But ho, ho, what's this? Years later, here I am cleaning out my old Disney and Barney videos and stumble across my old friend that I used to watch everyday. Even at my old age of fifteen, never failed to crack me up. Obviously, this isn't meant to be a contender for Oscars. Anyone can see that. But I can't find much to hate about a movie that's practically the visual to go along with the song \"Girls just wanna have fun.\" That's all it is, fun. And a lot of good fun at that. It's just a guilty pleasure, and it's so much fun to watch it with old friends singing into hair brushes and wearing feather boas. You just need to keep in mind that it was publicity for their new record and it's not meant to be one of those heavy movies you over-analyze. Recommendation: This movie is much funner when you watch it jumping up and down on a couch like a seven year old.",
         "This movie is FUN. And the sad thing is that most people are too close-minded to see that. The general consensus seems to be: \"It's the Spice Girls in a movie? It's going to be awful!\" and either they never see the movie, or they allow their prejudices to judge the movie for them. Firstly, let me say that I am not, and was never, a Spice Girls fan. I was way too old for their target market when they were popular, and whilst one or two of their songs had catchy tunes, some were downright annoying. They were a very cleverly manufactured girl band in a time when that market was wide-open. Giving each girl a distinctive character and style was a stroke of genius on the part of their 'creators', and while they didn't have particularly strong voices (except perhaps for Mel C), they didn't have particularly bad ones either. I've heard far worse. So I went into this movie purely out of curiosity, expecting it to be somewhere between awful and merely silly, but I ended up enjoying myself thoroughly. Also, my 65-year-old father loves this movie, and he saw it only having heard vaguely of the Spice Girls, but not knowing their music at all. Yes, Spiceworld is an exploitation movie; BUT it does an excellent job at it! What I loved most was the way it poked fun at itself all the way through. The character of the screenwriter pitching his idea to the girls' manager (brilliantly played by Richard E. Grant) saying \"It's obvious to us that the Spicegirls are movie stars!\", when it's obvious that they're not, and everyone knows it - there's even a scene at the beginning where he says, \"Yes, but can they ACT?\" and his boss responds with, 'Who cares?\", or similar. I loved that. And while the girls CAN'T really act (some are worse than others; I've read that Victoria was the only one who had taken acting lessons before, but I can't say it showed since I thought she was the weakest link), it's obvious that they're having fun with the script, and they don't do too badly at all. The script was another great surprise to me; it's full of good lines and funny characters that poke fun at themselves and their stereotypes. An example of this is the great Roger Moore playing the \"Chief\", who is presumably the Big Boss of the Spice Girls. We only ever see him on the phone with Clifford the manager (Richard E. Grant), and every time we do he is stroking, in pure Bond Villain (or Dr Evil) fashion, a small white animal on his lap. But every time you see him he has a different animal; first it's a cat, then a rabbit, a tiny white pig etc. I thought that was such a great way of poking fun at the stereotype of the villain always having a white pet. And then the character himself has these fantastically enigmatic, senseless, but hysterical lines, like: \"When the rabbit of chaos is pursued by the ferret of disorder through the fields of anarchy, it is time to hang your pants on the hook of darkness. Whether they're clean or not.\" and: \"The headless chicken can only know where he's been. He can't see where he's going. Do not be that chicken.\" I love that off-the-wall humour, and this movie is full of it. Of course, some people just don't GET that kind of humour, which is fine by me as long as it doesn't make them slam the film because of it. Other moments I love, which elevate this film from could-have-been-dodgy to funny, are the casting of Meatloaf as the Spice Girls bus driver, and then having him say lines like: {on fixing the clogged toilets} \"Hey, I love these girls. I'll do anything for them...but I won't do that!\" - which is, of course, a play on Meatloaf's hit song \"Anything for Love\". Also the parody of the stereotypical characters of the girls, which of course were made up for them anyway, like Victoria not knowing what to wear, and Mel C saying \"It must be really hard for you, Victoria, trying to decide whether to wear the little Gucci dress, or the little Gucci dress, or the little Gucci dress\", and Victoria responding \"Exactly!\", or when Victoria falls into the Thames and continues to scream for help once she's been rescued, and yelling \"This dress is dry-clean only!\", or Geri saying \"Calm down, haven't you ever heard of the word 'compromisation'?\" There are scores of these great moments but they really work better in the film than if I wrote them down here. All I'm saying is that this movie is not ever in a million years as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Yes, it's not the greatest, but then most films aren't. It's so much funnier than you'd think, and yes it has its cheesy moments, but sometimes it's SUPPOSED to be cheesy! That's where it's funny. I really don't understand why this film, whose only aim was to be FUN, and in this it succeeded more than admirably in my opinion, is in IMDb's Worst.",
         "It was made to be silly. There's nothing in this movie that's meant to offend anyone. It's a silly, fun-loving, harmless movie. I enjoyed it when I was 8 and I still do now at 18. Anyone who takes this movie seriously, needs to relax, have fun, enjoy the goofiness. This movie is one you can enjoy with your friends, family and young children DON'T have to be sent out of the room for inappropriate action. It's silly, remember that. It's supposed to make you laugh! All the girls are young, and the band still together. A few years later, everything fell apart for them. Enjoy the youth and laughter while you can.",
         "To be a teenage girl when the Spice Girls were around, there was no better time to be 12. I admit it, I was such a fan of the girl power group. How could you not be? Admit it, you say you hated them, but secretly you had a poster of Ginger Spice in your closet. They were cute, they were fun, they were talented and before you knew it they were gone. But for 2 years, it was nothing but girl power! So out of the height of their fame we naturally had to see if the Spice Girls were good for something else and that meant a movie! The Spice Girls made a movie, to show how crazy their lives were at the time and let them just have fun with it and they did spice up our lives real good. The Spice Girls are enjoying their fame, but they become dissatisfied with the burdens of it. A sinister newspaper owner, Kevin McMaxford, is trying to ruin the girls' reputation in order to cash in on the headlines, and even dispatches a photographer to take pictures and tape recordings of the girls. Annoying film director, Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth, who stalks the band along with his crew, hoping to use them as documentary subjects; at the same time, the girls' manager, Clifford, is fending off two overeager Hollywood writers, Martin Barnfield and Graydon, who relentlessly pitch absurd plot ideas for the girls' film. Amid this, the girls must prepare for a concert at the Albert Hall, their biggest performance yet. But between all this craziness, would they even want to continue to sing at the price of their friendships? You'll have to see, but I'm sure you could figure it out. I think a lot of people are a little too harsh on this film, the girls gave it a genuine try. You can tell they just had fun and wanted to do this for the fans. I think there were actually some really funny parts, like when they went through the spice boot camp. The whole last scene where they are going through their action scene in London, it's so random and just a good time. See, what I liked about this film was it's harmless nature. It was made for the fans specifically because we loved them so much. I admit that I'll watch it every once in a while still just to go back down memory lane and it still brings a smile on my face. The songs are so darn catchy, I can't help it. There are some very fun cameos that get a good giggle. The story is very predictable and the movie is over the top silly, but that is what makes it fun. I'm here to defend the film, I think people over analyze things way too much. Sometimes, you can't explain it, but you just want to let go of the real world and spice up your life a little bit. The Spice Girls may never win an Oscar, but they won the world's hearts for 2 short years, the girl power may have fizzled a little, but I'll take a trip down memory lane any time for Spice World. 6/10",
         "I was very early tweens when the Spice Girls dominated the world, and I remember the film coming out to cinemas; counting down the days till I could go see it! As a child and massive fan I found the film entertaining as it was to cracked up to be, it was all the phenomenon of the time. Looking back now it was a great time for me enjoying it and themselves as a girl group enjoying massive success and this is why I can accept why the film may not be any BAFTA hands down winner, obviously the film was never meant to be! It was written by their managers wife! And has too many more than subtle references about Britain. The acting is cheesy but no way did it tarnish any of the many important actors/comedians/singers who cameo'd in this film because as I remember Richard E. Grant saying it was just so great to be part of the experience, it really was a time-line in history. Now who cares whether he was lying or being honest we know he is an actor who gets paid big bucks, but the fact Roger Moore was in this film and Meatloaf, I don't think you can call them all sellouts. Fact is Spice Girls did make an impact on us all, this is just a bit of history left to show their mark.",
         "SPICEWORLD is a good, enjoyable movie. It is NOT Cinéma Vérité, nor is it supposed to be. You want a deep, poignant movie? A thriller? An action-flick? Watch something else. This movie is a farce, and was intended to be only that, nothing more. You people who didn't like the movie are expecting LORD OF THE RINGS or something, and this will never reach that level. But for a fun, energetic, insane romp with countless nods to classic movies, stars, and actors, this is perfect. The Spice Girls had their time in the limelight and used it to produce essentially a theatrically-released extended music video. If you're old enough to remember M-TV when it was actually JUST a music video channel, this is what SPICEWORLD is (think of the classic Michael Jackson video/movies like THRILLER where it was music and a bit of story tossed in for good measure). Nope, not Oscar\u0099 material by a long shot, but still quite enjoyable. Oh yes... one last thing: I saw this movie on PPV in 1998 and immediately fell in love with it and the Spice Girls. I was 28 then, and even though I'm 36 now, I still enjoy this movie for what it is. Perhaps that's because I'm OLD ENOUGH to know what it ISN'T.",
         "I've read comments about this movie being awful - and OK so its not something you have to use your brains for, but its FUNNY! These are the greatest pop legends of the 90's, Girl Power shook the world and so of course they were gonna exploit it for all their worth, but the thing that makes this pop band movie so much better than any other are the cameos, the list is endless. Its got more start turns than an Austin Powers movie, and thats saying something, and great thing is everyone has a sense of humour about their own position, even the girls themselves. I grew up with the Spice Girls and was a major fan - I'm 19 now but watching it now i find it even funnier - cos now i understand the jokes that flew over my head 8 years ago, and i know exactly who all these brilliant actors and musicians who make their cameos. It has great lines, a great and beautiful cast and shows the lives of the spice girls at their most normal and bizarre at the height of their fame, for the young girls the world over who loved the spice girls this is a great film to bring back the memories of almost 10 years ago. A must for fans - avoid if you had no love for these girls",
         "I love this movie simply because it's a good laugh. The acting is terrible, the plot is cheesy, but I love it all the same. You watch this movie, and you're going to think it's the worst excuse for a singing group promoting itself ever. And you'll be right. It is bad. But that's what makes it so great! It's a cheesy movie full of cheesy jokes. It's not supposed to be an academy award winner. It should be the first of the genre \"Cheesy for the sake of being Cheesy\". I mean, if Meatloaf voluntarily in this movie, we all know that it's not to be taken seriously. Mr. \"Bat-Out-Of-Hell\" himself wouldn't be in one of these movies to try and earn his acting credibility. Love this movie for what it is. A cheesy good laugh to watch if you're depressed.",
         "Not sure why they included the word 'World' in their Spice World title when the girls occupy just two countries in this movie. Wait, backing up, why the hell would anyone think this was a good idea? It's hard to pinpoint the most ridiculous and awful part of this over-complicated, and yet, plot less film. Was it the aliens that the girls could understand because of the subtitles? Was it the doctor on holiday when a baby just appears after birth? Was it the toilet photographer? Was it the Dr Who bus? Was it the Rocky theme for a half a dozen steps? Was it the neglecting-the-pregnant-friend morning scene so they could train sing at fruity boot camp? Was it Bond's sad turn as Blofeld? Was it the dozens of called in favors from the guest appearances? Was it the girls breaking the fourth wall in the end credits and, incredibly, believing there were more than one person in the audience? Was it the two teen fans that looked even less interested in spending time with the Spice Girls than anyone watching this even when they're playfully thrown from a random boat? My excuse for watching this terrible plea to buy their CDs was that I listen to the How Did This Get Made podcast and it's all-but pointless listening to that hilarious podcast if you haven't seen the movie they make fun of on their show. I cannot wait to hear what they have to say about this. (I actually have a good idea as I watched this film.) Basically we have five girlfriend singers who are stalked by an amateur documentary maker, sabotaged by a tabloid editor, yelled at by their manager, fantasized by the movie-within-the-movie director/writer and made to feel guilty by a random, yet never explained, pregnant friend. Mercifully \u0096 not really, but I do try to be positive at times \u0096 the girls keep on rocking and remain BFFs for-eve-r! How on Earth did this make From Justin to Kelly look comprehensible? My guess, this movie began the downfall of the group and even if you're a die-hard fan to the end, spare yourself from this dreadful pile of donkey's discharge. * * * Final thoughts: Admittedly, I actually attended a Spice Girls concert once, back in the 1990s. Personally, I only liked 2-3 of their songs (still do,) but not enough to see them in concert. But, for a friend who absolutely loved them, I bought two tickets for us to go since he was feeling down. For whatever reason, he couldn't go and he sent me with his boyfriend who also liked them. It was literally one of the most painful experiences I've had\u0085that is, up until I saw this movie. After showing up a ton late, the girls played a dozen or so songs I'd never heard of, nor liked, and took \u0096 no kidding, 4-5 15-minute intermissions in between every 2-3 songs. It wasn't bad enough I didn't really want to be there in the first place, I was barely friends with the boyfriend replacement and I didn't care for their music as a whole, but they stretched it out as long as possible with far too many breaks. And still, I would rather go back to that concert than watch this again.",
         "I am not a Spice Girls fan, but tried to watch the movie anyway just for some laughs. Instead I ended up turning it off about 15 min into it. The only part I saw was when they were on the bus and I couldn't take it. If you are a huge fan of theirs then perhaps you would like it, anyone else, please don't waste your time or money, you'll definitely be disappointed."
