         "Chuck Norris exciting vehicle with lots of action , thrills , suspense and spectacular kick-boxing fights . One time the Vietnam war is over , a Karate teacher named Matt Logan (Chuck Norris) keeps a new occupation as trainer , previous life as leader of a Vietnam commando named ¨The Black Tigers¨ (at his former film titled ¨Good guys wear black¨ by Ted Post) . A police lieutenant (Clu Gulager) attempts to resolve why his squad members (Jennifer O'Neill , Pepe Serna, Ron O'Neal, among others) are being mysteriously killed . Then Norris using his skills as fighter to help combat drug trafficking and discover as the undercover narcotic agents are being eliminated one-by-one . This stirring picture is plenty of action-packed , excitement , tense and cheesy sub-plot to boot with wild stunts . The story displays a plethora of martial-arts struggles and especially Thailand fighting . The movie featured three members of the Norris family in acting roles , these were Aaron Norris , Mike Norris and Chuck Norris . Here Norris cleans up the nasty fighters by means of punches , kicks , bounds and leaps with fights certainly slick . Mediocre screenplay in spite of being written by Ernest Tidyman (French Connection , Shaft). It's violent , frenetic and hectic and not particularly literary but worthy entry in Kung-Fu genre , although runs out energy surprisingly early. Average Norris-thriller , exciting and tense at times with fine work from Clint Ritchie, James Withmore Jr and Clu Gulager as a brilliant chief named Dune . And , of course , Karate expert Chuck Norris who saves the day with lots of visceral violence , he's a nice wrestler who possesses incredible strength . The motion picture was regularly directed by Paul Aaron , in his second theatrical feature film and he replaced filmmaker Ted Post . The film belongs Norris's early period , as during the 70s when he made low-average budget as ¨Breaker,Breaker¨, ¨Slaughter in San Francisco ¨, after that , in the 80s and 90s he acted in better movies as ¨Code of silence¨, ¨Delta Force¨ , ¨Silent rage¨ ,¨Octagon¨ ,¨Forced vengeance¨, ¨Delta Force I,II¨ , ¨An eye for an eye¨ among others , with successful box office at cinemas and video-rentals . In the 90s and 2000s with exception of ¨Walker Texas Ranger¨, the Norris star had gone down . Action addicts will give this one a passing grade , all others need not apply . If you're a previous Norris fans , you'll like it but contains enough action and violence for enthusiasts of the Karate genre . This is a must see if you're a die-hard Chuck Norris fan .",
         "A pair of Los Angeles narcotics police runs afoul of a group of distributors protected by a masked Kung Fu enforcer who will stop at nothing to ensure the flow of drugs. Enter Matt Logan (Chuck Norris) a Vietnam vet now world famous kick boxer making a run at the title. The police consult Logan and are eventually able to get him to help train the other members of the narc squad in Kung Fu. Logan takes a look into the case and finds out that police corruption and ex-war buddies may some how be involved. Chuck Norris movies (for the most part) are usually good fun. A good many of Norris' earlier films are good solid action flicks, not necessarily classics but fun nonetheless.\" A Force of One\" is a fun film but is severely dated. However it moves at a good clip and the action scenes are pretty decent. Many of the usual clichés are on display and good olé' Chuck has his way with the bad guys.",
         "I wouldn't mind one of those Matt Logan t-shirts you see his people wearing in the movie� well sadly you don't get one with the DVD. Oh well. After the box-office success of \"Good Guys Wear Black\", Chuck Norris would roll out another then another. \"A Force of One\" was one of those. These earlier films (\"Good Guys Wear Black\", \"A Force of One\" and \"The Octagon\") backed by American Cinema seemed to have the same style and formula; but while they did have thick, knotty plots (like something out of a crime/cop show), Chuck didn't entirely get much of a work out compared to some of his fun, over-the-top 80s work. \"A Force of One\" is a decent, if not particularly igniting old-school Chuck Norris outing where he's confronting drugs with a karate chop/kick. A team of narcotics agents enlist the help of a martial arts expert Matt Logan, when some of their agents end up dead by a serial killer who uses karate. Hesitant to help at first, but soon Logan finds it personal --- revenge and honour. There's some action; well staged too (like the climatic battle outside the ring), but a lot more time is spent in training (for his championship fight), lessons (for the narcotics agents), being a mentor figure and then trying to connect the dots on who might be the karate serial killer (with little surprise on the reveal). It's rather talky and consisting of the same patterns, but never was I bored. Norris is looking much more comfortable than say in his last role. He comes across genuine in his moods, having a sense of humour and of course delivers on what matters --- amazing martial arts and stunt work. Across from him is a headstrong Jennifer O'Neal. Also the cast features big players like Clu Gulager, Ron O'Neal, James Whitemore Jr. and Charles Cyphers. Paul Aaron's direction is competently tidy, drawing up some striking set-pieces accompanied by Dick Halligan's rhythmic music score of offbeat tempos. Well made, but standard action/investigative fare.",
         "And, that force is Chuck Norris, a master in the martial arts, preparing for the big fight in a tournament, called upon by a California narcotics division to train the detectives in how to fight a mysterious adversary who killed two cops with his bare hands during a secret raid(they did not call in for back up). A kid on a skateboard is the one who helps transport the drugs from one place to the other while a crooked cop is in cahoots with a drug-dealer using a sporting goods store as a front to distribute smack, coke, and other powder junk. Jennifer O'Neill glams down(sort of)as a detective, Mandy Rust(getting top honors in the cast over Norris) who becomes close friends with Norris' Matt Logan, her hair cut, dressed in casual \"cop\" attire(..although she's still a knockout in a cocktail dress), who suspects a fellow partner in her squad(..the film establishes who this person is as he is doing business with the mastermind of the drug operation). Clu Gulager is the chief of the narcotics division, Dunne and Ron O'Neal is a fellow detective Rollins. Bill Wallace is Sparks, the man Logan is to fight in the big main event. Mandy is the one who helps lure Logan into assisting them in martial arts training. It was kind of neat seeing Norris(and his brother Aaron who helped choreograph the fight sequences)training the detectives in one particular sequence, on offensive and defensive maneuvers. Important sub-plot added by director Paul Aaron(..initially called in just to help in rewrites of the script, celebrated by the add campaign as being co-written by Ernest Tidyman, due to his heat on helping pen The French Connection)provides Logan with an adopted son, Charlie(Eric Laneuville)for whom he has raised and trained, both hoping for much future success. This success will never come to fruition due to a hunch Charlie gets regarding his uncovering key figures responsible for the drug operation, including the identity of the martial artist killing cops. This killer with superior skills and power than Charlie, doesn't allow him to leave, because of what he has learned. This sub-plot, of course, gives Norris an excuse to get seriously miffed(to put it mildly), exercising his right to deliver a major ass-kicking to the one responsible for Charlie's death. Many of Norris' movies feature a tragedy, the murder of a loved one or buddy, which motivates his characters to get even with the scum who commit the deed that resulted in the loss. Mix of detective drama and martial arts showcase for Norris with a tidy conclusion as the guilty parties will be brought to justice and Logan is allowed to get his revenge. Interesting decision to shoot combat between Norris and his opposition in slow motion(opening an opportunity for scrutiny such as Wallace's elbow clearly missing Norris' face, yet he reacts jarringly anyway as if he did), inside and outside the ring. Known as a follow-up to Good Guys Wear Black, neither film resemble each other in any way either in content or characters(this is mainly because American Cinema Pictures distributed both films, opening a door for Norris' stardom, although ultimately it would be the third collaboration, The Octagon, that would hit pay-dirt). The killer, who sneak-assaults detectives who uncover locations containing the hidden drugs, wears a black ski-mask and jeans, explosively subduing them before they have a chance to defend themselves, hence the training of the other cops. While A Force of One gave viewers a chance to see Norris in action, expressing his abilities, The Octagon really was the movie that let him break out as a force to be reckoned with.",
         "Back when A Force of One was originally released, I viewed Chuck Norris' movies as boring, brainless, and cheap. In the years since, I've changed that original assessment and can see them for what they really are. Now I look at these early Chuck Norris' movies as fun, brainless, and cheap. The plot is incredibly simple and shows a total lack of creativity. When two cops are killed by someone using Martial Arts, they seek out the one man who might be able to help them � the local karate champion, Matt Logan (Norris). The cops quickly persuade Matt to help them, but when Matt's son turns up dead, he goes from helping to an active participant. Instead of writing a regular review or pointing out strengths and weaknesses in the movie, I'll just list a few random thoughts I had while watching: · It's not that the cops are skeptical about how karate can help them, a few act like they can't even pronounce the word. · The needle marks in that girl's arm makes it look like she been using a turkey-baster to shoot-up with. · You would think that after one set of cops is killed that the superior officer would do a better job of keeping track of where and what his men are working on. · Wow, a ninja in the stockroom! You just don't see enough of stuff like that in real life. · If you couldn't guess that Matt's son was going to get into serious trouble when he started his own investigating, you haven't seen enough bad action movies. · The identities of the bad guys are so obvious it's embarrassing. · Why is the police captain wearing a Matt Logan t-shirt under his bath robe? It may be bad, but there are still several enjoyable moments. One of my favorites is the most obvious � watching Chuck Norris square off against Bill 'Superfoot\" Wallace. Two legends of the Martial Arts in a fight to the death � good stuff. It almost makes the whole movie worthwhile.",
         "This is a for the most part a watchable action film,but It's only average at best. It has a couple of good scraps, and the finale is excellent, however it was a bit talky at times,and some of the dialog bored me, but it did have a couple powerful moments, and Chuck Norris was a lot of fun to watch. It's very low budget,and it had a couple of laughable moments, but it wasn't that bad, but it wasn't really that good either. The Direction Is average, but decent for a low very low budget film. Paul Aaron,does what he can, but it's nothing special, rather bland actually, but still he keeps the film at least watchable throughout. The Acting is not bad. Chuck Norris is very good here,while he was somewhat wooden at times, he was a lot of fun to watch, and did a credible job for the most part!(Norris rules). Jennifer O'Neill is very good here, she had good chemistry with Norris, and was very likable. Clu Gulager is a great character actor and was excellent as the detective. Bill Wallace is terrible acting wise, but shows off his outstanding martial art skills. Overall worth one watch i suppose but nothing more then that. ** out of 5",
         "Chuck Norris gives a less than scintillating performance in this early work but just about passes muster in his role as a professional karate fighter helping police track down a serial killer who uses martial arts.The fight scenes are acceptable if not that spectacular and are helped no end by the presence as the villain of Bill Wallace,the real life champion with the famous \"superfoot\" who proves a tough match for Norris at the climax.Other performances from the likes of Jennifer O'Neill and Ron O'Neal are serviceable and give flavour to what is essentially an example of the sort of movie that would shortly become so popular in the burgeoning video boom that shortly followed its original release.This eventually provided the core of Chuck Norris fans that were enough to give him for a brief time a taste of 'A'list movie stardom in the early to mid 80's.",
         "The 70s saw the explosion of martial arts movies and with it the introduction of Chuck Norris. Few remember that he began as a bad guy, a hit-man called in to slay Bruce Lee in \"Way of the Dragon.\" In that flick, a brutish young Norris, looking all muscle and chest hair, met his death at the hands of the invincible Lee. But Norris went on to play the hero - as a cop, martial arts trainer or American soldier - in a string of action movies through the 70s and 80s. \"Force of One\" was one of the best. It features Norris as Matt Logan, a karate champion and trainer, who is called upon by the local police to help them break a drug ring. The ring employs a shadowy assassin who uses martial arts to kill cops that get to close to cracking the case. The movie starts with two undercover cops following a skateboarding kid, suspected of dealing drugs, into an empty store. Within minutes, the cops are ambushed by a silent masked killer who expertly snaps both their necks. The killer first punishes them with kicks so powerful they raise them right off the floor, letting us know early on that this is no average street thug, but rather a highly trained martial artist. The scene cuts to Norris battering an opponent in a kickboxing match. Norris looks like the champ he is with a chiseled fighter's physique and lighting fast moves. Later at his karate school, Lt. Dunne (Clu Gulager) asks him for his help in training cops in martial arts. Though Norris is busy preparing for his upcoming championship fight, he's implored by a beautiful policewoman, played Jennifer O'Neill, and by his adopted teenage son Charlie, himself a junior karate champ, to help stop the flow of drugs to kids. At first the cops themselves are resistant to the training, thinking it's just a gimmick. Moskowitz (James Whitmore, Jr.,) a tough street cop, grumbles \"What good does it do me to be able to bust a two by four with my bare hands?\" Meanwhile two more cops are seen following the same young skateboarder. It's obvious the kid is just a decoy to lure cops into danger. He does his job well and watches as the assassin gets the drop on the cops and again snuffs each officer with expert karate moves. Chuck's romance with Jennifer O'Neil starts to bloom, while his son Charlie starts some sleuthing on his own. When they all attend a karate match together to check out Chuck's next opponent, we are introduced to Jerry Sparks, played by Bill Wallace. Wallace was a world champion martial artist for real and his ability to win matches with savage kicks gave him the nickname \"Superfoot.\" Superbly muscled, his physical presence makes a perfect foil for the sculpted Norris. When Charlie discovers that Wallace is the mysterious assassin, he tries to fight him, but he's no match for Superfoot's lethal feet. When his body is found, Norris vows revenge and the final showdown between the two warriors is set. Their fight is the highpoint of the movie. Evenly matched, Norris and Wallace duke it out, with Wallace's feet and Chuck's fists front and center. Finally, Chuck turns the tables and delivers a devastating kick of his own. He grabs the stunned Wallace's neck and twists around, hauling him onto his back and \"hanging\" him. He keeps the hold on long after Superfoot's body has gone limp, exacting a brutal revenge for his slain son. With his execution, the rest of the drug ring is easily rounded up. This fight is the climax of an exciting movie which is worth viewing just to see these two martial arts champions in action.",
         "Like my previous Chuck Norris film review, I also saw this one at a local drive in with a couple of neighbors. I can't remember too much of it, but do remember that it was entertaining in regards to a corrupt police investigation of some kind, something involving drugs, and, of course, martial arts. It was one of Chucks better flicks, and he showed some chops in the acting department, but I can't say that the film stuck with me all that much. Regardless, it was somewhat impressive. Ironically enough the one thing I remember about going to see this film was the preview for \"The Villain\", a western spoof. There's not much in the way of plot in this thing, but it has a decent enough emotional story. If you're into martial arts, and want to see Chuck Norris early in his career, give this film a try. Not a bad watch. Enjoy.",
         "After he did \"Good Guys Wears Black\" Chuck Norris, comes back with \"A Force of One\", which is not the biggest thing on the big screen, but it is very watchable though. Norris plays Matt Logan, a karate instructor in California who helps the police catch a killer who uses martial arts for murder. His target, cops! Anyone in their right mind who kill with martial arts is dishonorable and should be dealt with personally. Jennifer O'Neil plays the cop who works with Logan, and learns a thing or two about discipline. The full-contact scenes were great, it kept my interest in the martial arts alive. It's a shame that Logan's son(Eric Laneuville, before St. Elsewhere) got killed by the men he taught. And now, the fight to the finish is what the movie is about. Very tame, yet entertaining throughout. \"A Force of One\" isn't supposed to be high action, it's more fusional than most martial arts films. It is a big keeper for Chuck Norris fans! 2.5 out of 5 stars!"
