         "Great MGM color musical from 1947 that boasts terrific performances from June Allyson and Peter Lawford as the stars and Joan McCracken, Ray McDonald, Patricia Marshall, Connie Gilchrist, Donald McBride, Mel Torme, Tom Dugan, Clint Sundberg, and Jane Green in support. \"Pass That Peacepipe\" is one of the best production numbers I've ever seen, and McCracken and McDonald are super in it. It seems to have only 3 cuts in it and it's an amazing production numbers full of color and energy. Allyson and Lawford have so much fun in the \"Varsity Drag\" number on a huge stage that it's infectious (but watch for the female dancer in pink who falls). Good songs throughout from the 20s stage show like the title song as well as \"Lucky in Love,\" \"The Best Things in Life Are Free,\" \"Lady's Man,\" \"Good News,\" \"The French Lesson,\" and the sad song \"Just Imagine\" Allyson sings. Lively, colorful, and totally fun, this is an grossly underrated musical from MGM's golden years. The 40s riff on 20s songs works thanks to Kay Thompson, Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Great fun from the opening sequence til the end. Joan McCracken, by the way, was married to Bob Fosse.",
         "Aside from Peter Lawford and June Allyson, no great stars came out of this classic movie. Yes, I know Mel Torm√© was in it but he made his fame playing the drums and not in films. But, this film made a tremendous impression on me when I saw it as a 10 year old kid. Not to mention the fact that my aunt (was a teenager at the time) had an old 78 with \"Pass that peace pipe...\" When I came across the video, I had to watch the peace pipe number about 15 times before I could get enough of it. This is not a perfect, slick film by any means and as full of flaws as a jock's composition paper for English 1A: the hair and clothing styles are late 40s and not the late 20s as the story is set; the characters are often thin and underdeveloped; Mel Torm√©'s acting is awful but, the show is still great. One of the things that makes it great is Joan McCracken who, tragically, never got her career off the ground, as it were. Her timing, her delivery and solid singing and dancing cover any shortages one would find with any of the rest. OK, so Lawford wasn't a great singer but the French lesson works. June Allyson was no Catherine Grayson but her rendition of \"The Best Things in Life are Free\" is classic. This is just a great show. I waited for nearly 50 years to see it again and when I finally got the chance, I did watch that great dance sequence of \"Bury that hatchet and pass that peace pipe, like the Chocktaw, Chipawah, Chatanoogah, etc.\"",
         "Good News is one of the most underrated MGM musicals from the '40s I've ever seen from that era. While leads June Allyson and Peter Lawford are no Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney (who ironically, were the original considered leads for this movie version years ago), they sing and dance entertainingly enough for one to not notice after a while. Another underrated talent showcased here is one Joan McCracken who shines in the opening number and the later made-for-film specialty \"Pass That Peace Pipe\", which was eventually nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song. And dig the \"Velvet Fog\" Mel Torme in his younger days crooning here! Excellent debut for director Charles Walters and screenwriters Betty Comden and Adolph Green makes this one of the most spectacular musical comedies I've seen yet! P.S. Among the extras on the DVD are two numbers from the 1930 film version of Good News, the title number and \"The Varsity Drag\", both performed energetically and athletically by a young woman named Dorothy McNulty, later to be known as Penny Singleton from the Blondie movies. All of the above are well worth checking out!",
         "This movie and other MGM musicals in particular should be viewed by anyone who thinks they want to produce a film musical today. Watch the Pass That Piece Pipe number and the Varsity drag. Pretend you are the camera and take note of the long uninterrupted takes and the fluid motion of the dancing in concert with the camera. Then look at the musical numbers from Chicago . . . where all they did was cheat and all the action was produced in the cutting room . . the skill is gone. It is a lost art, along with dancing which has been replaced by callesthenics. Also, if you look closely to the left of the screen in the early part of The Varsity Drag, you will see one of the dancers hold her head and drop to the floor. She does not reappear in the remainder of the shot. June and Peter are the perfect couple and he is totally light on his feet unlike Richard Gere who was so lauded for being a non-dancer who was now \"dancing\" . . . ha! Now Peter was actually a non-dancer who was dancing and doing a good job of it without cheating, just as Frank Sinatra did in Take Me Out to the Ballgame.",
         "Football is in the fall, at least nowadays it is. Prom is in the spring. So is graduation, at small colleges (I think). This movie had football, prom, and graduation, all in the spring. Then, to top it all off, Tommy said he was getting a degree in French LOL. Tommy came off as such a dunce, and I never really picked up on what his major was, anyway. I expected the women's hairstyles to be short bobs of the 1920s, and more Charleston dancing. These two points became lost when I decided to let myself get lost in the escapism and pure entertainment. All in all, I still like this movie, very much. I really like the singing of June and Peter, and feel that they had very nice voices. Hope they were not dubbed. At any rate, they were honest and heartfelt vocal renderings. June Allyson passed away several days ago (today is July 16, 2006), at age 88. In 'Good News', which I saw today for the third time, I figured I would melt in tears when she & Peter Lawford did the scene of 'The French Lesson'. That happened a little when I saw June in 'Little Women', shown 2 hours or so earlier, where Jo meets Laurie (June & Peter) late in the movie (I just saw the last part of it). I knew that I would be watching them again in 'Good News' a little later, because today was the June Allyson special presentation on TCM (7 of her movies). I do like the 'Varsity Drag' in 'Good News', and wish June had danced more in this movie. I did enjoy how she and Peter led all the other dancers in the huge finale, each leading their group in a large tight triangle. It was so neat. RIP June and Peter. We love you so. I am still melting in tears. 12/10",
         "Neglected MGM musical has some great things going for it. For one thing, it has an amusing Adolph & Green script, some dazzling dance numbers choreographed to perfection, and a simple plot (two gals in love with the same fellow) that never gets in the way of the well staged song-and-dance numbers. It gives a charming look at college life in the 1920s--in non-realistic fashion, of course! June Allyson's singing voice never impressed me but she's a good dancer and here she proves it in the \"Varsity Drag\" number. Peter Lawford is surprisingly good considering he's miscast as the football player (where was Van Johnson?) Joan McCracken almost steals the show with her frantic dancing amid talented chorus boys in the \"Pass That Peace Pipe\" number in a drugstore, a highlight among the dance routines. Allyson and Lawford are terrific on \"The French Lesson\" and she is properly wistful in her rendition of \"The Best Things In Life Are Free\". Patricia Marshall does well as \"the other girl\" in a role originally offered to Gloria de Haven who rejected it as too similar to her other \"spoiled girl\" roles. Some of the humor falls flat and dates the picture badly, particularly the overdone scene with Connie Gilchrist repeating words June has written for her. All in all, a fun-filled, tuneful college comedy about academics and football with an early glimpse of Mel Torme. Lighthearted plot with a solid score! Trivia note: It's amazing how far JUNE ALLYSON went on virtually no singing voice to speak of, and a modest talent for kicking up her heels. But she and Lawford are charming here.",
         "Director Charles Walters was no Vincente Minnelli or Stanley Donen, and June Allyson and Peter Lawford were no Judy Garland and Gene Kelly. Thus, 1947's \"Good News\" is just a solid second-tier musical among the Arthur Freed productions at MGM. The MGM back-lot stands in for Tait College, an upper-crust haven for nattily-dressed collegiates with little besides romance on their minds. A silly plot, which links a couple of good songs (\"Lucky in Love,\" \"The Best Things in Life are Free\") with a few dull ones, ends with a rousing finale, \"The Varsity Drag.\" That energetic production number is so lively and infectious, all the nonsense that precedes is forgiven. And there is a lot of nonsense to forgive. Peter Lawford, egotistical football jock Tommy Marlowe, is an insensitive cad; except for his good looks, he is unworthy of a second glance from the likes of June Allyson's Connie Lane. Connie works in the library, studies hard, and, for some reason, fails to catch the eye of the male students. Instead of pursuing Connie, the shallow dim-witted Tommy is quickly smitten by gold-digging Patricia Marshall, a new coed, whose faux French includes the film's best line: \"Quelle fromage.\" The musical numbers feature three performers who never quite made the big leagues on film, the afore-mentioned Marshall, Joan McCracken, and Mel Torme. Their failure was not for lack of effort; the three give it the old college try here, but Marshall has an unsympathetic role, McCracken is overly kinetic, and Torme lacks a face to match his voice. Although Lawford lacks a voice to match his face, evidently Hollywood values looks over other talents. However, as he proved in other MGM musicals like \"Easter Parade,\" Lawford could carry a tune and, certainly in \"The Varsity Drag\" number, could dance quite well. While Allyson has only a passable voice, her innocence and sweetness get her a pass for anything she may lack musically, although she too does quite well in the big finale. \"Good News\" is simplistic romantic fun with a few good songs and a terrific production number. Although only 93 minutes in length, the film does drag a bit at times; \"Pass that Peace Pipe\" seems endless; the football game goes on and on; and McCracken's use of family millions to divert Marshall from man to man is a tiresome gag. \"Good News\" is worth a view, and the \"Varsity Drag\" number is worth revisiting, but Tait College should have taught screen writing and lured higher caliber students.",
         "The good news about \"Good News\" is that there really isn't any good news. (Ha! Just kidding there, folks!) Actually, the good news about \"Good News\" is that this Technicolor Musical/Comedy from 1947 does, surprisingly enough, feature 3 outstanding and really swinging musical numbers, which are - Pass The Peace Pipe, Varsity Rag and the film's opening sequence. But, on the other hand, the bad news about \"Good News\" is that, no, these 3 high-energy musical numbers do not in any way, shape, or form, come anywhere near to compensating the viewer for having to endure the drab and clich√©d triteness of the rest of the film. This picture's predictable, little story concerns the activities of a bunch of super-preppy rich kids in the late 1920s who are attending Tait University. When these \"golly-gee\" brats aren't singing up a storm (sometimes quite out of tune), they spend most of their time either partying and/or gossiping about who's dating who. These spoiled-rotten, whipper-snappers seem to have very little concern about their studies, their grades, or their finances. (Well, what the heck could you expect from this bunch, anyways?) To be totally honest here, I thought that \"Good News\" (for the most part) really sucked. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. (But, hey, to each his own, is what I always say) One of this film's biggest let-downs was that its 2 big-name stars, Peter Lawford and June Allyson, couldn't carry a tune even if their lives depended on it. They really couldn't. (I really couldn't say much in favor of their dancing, or acting, either) And, that, my friends, is the good news, as well as the bad news, about \"Good News\".",
         "Campus fanfare in the l920s with Peter Lawford, the captain of the football team, a campus heart-throb, needing to pass his French exam so that he can play in the football game. Of course, June Allyson is called in to tutor him, the same girl he broke a prom date with so that he could escort the new girl on campus, a snob-seeking status girl, only interested in money. I just love these so called college musicals where academics is never really the focus, but rather good old fashion fun. What makes this film a delight is the singing and dancing. While Lawford's voice could have been better, he does fairly well nonetheless. Allyson, who was 30 at the time the movie was made, looks like a college co-ed all the way. Mel Torme has his moments as a college student as well.",
         "Despite winning an Oscar for one of its songs, \"Good News\" appears to be a strictly second-tier sort of musical with little to distinguish it. The plot is paper-thin, the singing a bit suspect and the film very light and forgettable. The film is set at Tait College in 1927 (though, oddly, the women's hair and many of the dresses are strictly 1940s). The plot hinges on whether the school's star quarterback (Peter Lawford) will pursue a snobbish new student (Patricia Marshall) or recognize how wonderful the assistant librarian (June Allyson) is. The plot doesn't get any deeper than that! Like all musicals, the film is chock full of singing as well as dance numbers. However, I was amazed at the mediocrity (at best) of most of the singing. Apart from Mel Torm√© (who had a great voice), the singers are either adequate (such as Allyson) or pretty awful (Lawford--who NEVER should have been allowed to sing in a musical). The songs, while bouncy, are pretty much fluff--which works perfectly with the plot, which is also pure fluff. Overall, the film isn't unpleasant but it also isn't very good or memorable. Strictly a second-tier sort of film from MGM. By the way, I thought it awfully funny that when Allyson was supposedly teaching Lawford French, she would say words in French and invariably, Lawford's pronunciation (of words he'd never supposedly heard before) was as good or better!"
