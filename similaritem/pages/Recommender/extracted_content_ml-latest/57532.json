      "synopsis": "The film opens with a Spartan elder inspecting a talking baby ogre. The baby vomits on the inspector and is then discarded with a punt off the hill. Next, he inspects a Vietnamese baby, and Brangelina instantly adopts it. Baby Leonidas is then inspected, having a six-pack, biceps, and beard from birth. He is accepted as a Spartan and prepared for kinghood through his childhood training, from fighting his grandmother to enduring torture. Leonidas (Sean Maguire) is then cast out into the wild, and survives the harsh winter while killing a giant dancing penguin. Returning a king for his inauguration ceremony, Leonidas sees Margo (Carmen Electra) dancing and asks her to marry him, to which she responds by giving him the combination to her chastity belt. Years later, Leonidas is training when Captain (Kevin Sorbo) informs him that a Persian messenger has arrived. The messenger has come to present Xerxes' demands for Sparta's submission. Leonidas arrives to greet the messenger in the Spartan way (high-fives for the women and open mouth tongue kisses for the men). After growing angry with both the messenger's disrespect and making out with his wife, Leonidas kicks him, the messenger's bodyguards, and then several other people he simply disliked, ranging from Britney Spears (Nicole Parker), Ryan Seacrest, Michael Jackson and Kevin Federline (Nick Steele) to Sanjaya Malakar (Tony Yalda) and the American Idol judges into \"the pit of death\". As Leonidas walks off he turns to a column that has a switch that reads \"Garbage Disposal\", and flips the switch causing the celebrities to spiral to their \"death\". Resolving to face the Persians, Leonidas visits the Oracle, proposing an \"erotic-sounding\" strategy to repel the numerically superior enemy after offering the priests various skin-care lotions for guidance. The Oracle, Ugly Betty (Crista Flanagan), reveals that Leonidas will die should he go to war. The next day, Leonidas meets the soldiers assembled for his departure to Thermopylae, and finds that only 13 (not 300) were accepted in the army, since there were stringent specifications to be accepted \"Hunky with deep Mediterranean tans, and well-endowed\". Three among them include Captain, his son, Sonio, and a slightly unfit Spartan named Dilio, who, as the Captain states, \"Has a lot of heart...and nice man boobs.\" Once at the Hot Gates, they encounter Paris Hilton (also played by Parker), who tells Leonidas and the Captain about a secret goat path above the Hot Gates that Xerxes could use to outflank the Spartans. When she asks to be made a Spartan soldier Leonidas rejects her as unqualified. Leonidas and his platoon soon face off with Xerxes' messenger and his Immortals, beating them in a dance contest before driving them off a cliff. Xerxes (Ken Davitian), impressed, personally approaches Leonidas and attempts to bribe him in a Deal or No Deal fashion. Despite the soldiers' encouragements, the Spartan king declines, saying that he will instead make the \"God King\" fall. The Spartans then face the Persian army in a \"Yo Momma\" fight, ending with a victory, in spite of Dilio having his eyes scratched out. Though victory seemed to be in the Spartans' grasp, Paris Hilton betrays the Spartans and reveals the location of the goat path to Xerxes, having been promised having her hump removed as one of her traitorous rewards. Using a CGI army, Xerxes meets the 12 remaining Spartans and the war is on. Meanwhile, back in Sparta, Queen Margo sexually submits to Traitoro in order to persuade him to send more troops to assist Leonidas. He states that he will finally lose his virginity while using his cell phone to take pictures. However, he reveals publicly that she has not been chaste. The anger at this revelation provokes a symbiote suit to envelop her, mirroring the parasitic symbiote Spider-Man suit in Spider-Man 3. She fights with Traitoro, who, in line with the parody, becomes the Spider-Man 3 villain the Sandman. Margo wins the battle with a vacuum cleaner - and Traitoro's treachery is revealed when it is discovered that Xerxes is in Traitoro's Top Five, whereupon Sparta agrees to send more troops. At the Battle of Thermopylae, the Persians introduce their secret weapons: Ghost Rider, who is quickly defeated, and Rocky Balboa, who decapitates Sonio with one right hook but is killed by a vengeful Captain with a Botox-laced syringe. Captain then gets killed by a spear, thrown through his torso by Xerxes. Captain's death enrages Leonidas, and the battle sequence switches to a Grand Theft Auto-esque format as he runs through the Persian Army and corners Xerxes. While running away, Xerxes finds the \"Transformer Cube\" and harnesses its power to combine with a convertible to become \"Xerxestron\", playing \"Leave Britney Alone\" videos to prove his \"godly power\". But Xerxestron ends up delivering on Leonidas's promise to \"fall\", as his power cord disconnects and he falls forward, crushing the surviving Spartans under his bulk. Thus the narrator concludes, \"Leonidas was true to his word: a god-king did fall... but unfortunately, right on them!\" The blind Dilio, who left prior to the final battle, eventually returns to Sparta to tell of Leonidas' final moments. A year later, Dilio leads a force of one hundred real Spartans and several thousand CGI-ones to defeat the Persians, but the blind warrior ends up going the wrong way and leads the Spartans to Malibu. They end up crashing into Lindsay Lohan as she once more leaves drug rehab, causing her to expose her bare groin and fly off screen. The film ends with a musical number set to Gloria Gaynor's \"I Will Survive\" performed on American Idol by all of the characters in the film. It also spoofs Britney Spears' VMA comeback performance.",

         "Anyone who would remotely consider themselves to be a fan of the spoof genre would reject this trash. I'll be the first one to admit that taste is subjective, but the guys that made this movie lack any sort of talent for this type of movie I implore anyone to check out the following spoof movies: Airplane! Top Secret The Naked Gun The Naked Gun 2 1/2 Hot Shots Hot Shots: Part Deux Kentucky Fried Movie (yes, its \"old\" but a classic none the less) Mafia! BASEketball Scary Movie 3 Sacry Movie 4 Not all of these are great. Many are a product of their era. Some are downright \"average\" spoof movies, at best. But compared to \"Meet the Spartans\" (or Epic Movie or Date Movie) they are a BILLION times better. And they have one thing in common... Zucker / Abrahams / Zucker (also must give props to writer Pat Proft). These guys INVENTED this genre. Watch these films and you will realize Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer are talentless hacks who think just making a reference to pop culture is funny. If Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer are reading this, I suggest you might want to watch these movies as well. You might learn a thing or two.",
         "A dismal failure of a spoof with only the slightest bit of funny. This dreck breaks all the rules of good spoofing. 1. Be timely. A joke about Ellen in Mr Wrong? Really? 2. Be funny when offensive. Accident prone kid in Scary Movie 3, mildly funny. Assault on a kid by Spartian, not funny. 3. Be subtle sometimes. Not everything has to go to the extreme. 4. Be broad. Go everywhere for your spoofs, not just the same wells over and over. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY.... 5. DON'T EXPLAIN EVERY RIFF AND SOURCE MATERIAL. If you have to tell your audience where it comes from, chances are it's not funny. The fact that this film is only 60 odd minutes plus one of the longest credit sequences loaded with even more unfunny deleted scenes (seriously can't those wait for the DVD no one should buy either), that's just adding insult to injury.",
         "I don't know how my brain allowed me to see this picture. I thought it would be like trying to suffocate yourself; your body would just shut down before you could do it. Apparently I was wrong. I sat through this movie and laughed once, and that was during the preview for another movie. There was the odd part where I might have cracked a smile or thought, \"This might be funny if...\" but there is a very good reason for that. Instead of making good jokes and thoughtful humour, the writers decided to just constantly send an endless stream of jokes at you and hoped one of them made you chuckle. This movie was truly atrocious. You would think after having their last two films be on the bottom 100 of this site, the makers would say, \"Lets try something different,\" but no, it is the exact same as Date Movie and Epic Movie; Bad.",
         "This is perhaps one of the most awful films I've seen. Much as I enjoy tacky spoof humor, this movie just falls flat. So many of the film's jokes are so drawn out that whatever humor originally present just gets diluted. It was funny kicking a celebrity into the pit of death once. Five times later, it's just stale and dragging. If you've seen the trailers to this, you've basically seen about 90% of the film. The script could have been easily condensed to a 10 minute sketch for Saturday Night Live. The humor is so repetitive; almost all of the jokes play off either the Spartans questionable sexuality or celebrities' promiscuity. A blurred-out vagina just isn't that funny, why did the movie choose to use it 5 times? While there were numerous pop-culture references, there simply wasn't much done with it. Someone forgot to tell the middle-schooler who wrote this that having a poorly impersonated celebrity appear isn't funny by itself. Don't see this movie, even if you liked similar spoof movies (like Scary Movie).",
         "Me movie is good. Me am smart. Make funny ha ha joke! Ha Ha! Me show you... ug.... people you am know from pop culture tabloids. Me make fun of them! Me show you fat person and you laugh! You laugh at little midgets and farting! PBBBLLLP! Fart noise! HA HA Funny! Me poop my pants. In funny movie Meet Spartans I make fun of other movie. I take scenes from movies you know and make them funny. I add farts or have people kicked down into a hole. I make funny gay jokes about gay people! Ha ha! Don't forget, you laugh at Kevin Federline because he is big loser! Him think he can rap just like me think me can write joke! Me write movie! You remember Epic Movie? Me write that too. Me write with crayons or my own poop that I scoop out of toilet after I fart and go pooh. Me make funny jokes about Paris Hilton. She so stupid! She am loose sexually. Ha HA HA! Me write sequel soon. Me deserve bazillions of dollars for buying things me stupid family deserve. Me ug fbloduad boodle! HAHA!",
         "I work at a movie theater, so the only reason I went to see this movie was because it was free and I thought that it just might be the kind of movie that's so bad me and my friends could entertain ourselves by making fun of it. However, Meet the Spartans left us completely dumbfounded and speechless. It's beyond bad! There was nothing you could say that could make of this movie, it does it all by itself and it doesn't even allow you to laugh while you watch it going down in flames. I considered its predecessor, Epic Movie, to be among one of the worst movies ever made. I didn't think it could possibly get worse, but it did. It's like watching 300 all over again expect with ridiculous pop culture references that aren't even funny. The guys who made this movie obviously don't understand comedy in the slightest bit. I hope that this is the last one of these ridiculous comedies that gets to occupy a theater over another film that might actually be worth something. This film is a waste of money for starters, but even if you don't have to pay, it's just a waste of time.",
         "I was recently forced to sit through Meet the Spartans. Ill start by saying that i'm very sick of all this epic/date/scary movie junk. It's been overdone and only appeals to people under the age of 9. The humor in this movie was just as awful as i thought it would be and i could predict the entire movie. I was told before-hand that it was only about 90 minutes, and was a little upset id be paying for that. After watching the movie i was beyond glad that i only had to be tortured for that long, rather than the usual 2 hours. I'll close by saying that if you're forced to watch this movie, rip your eyes out of your skull and pour salt into your head. It will be much more enjoyable.",
         "I saw this the other day with a group of friends and I'm not sure I even saw all of it, but what I saw was enough for me to wish my $7.50 and the hour back. Seriously the version I saw was only and hour. I'm not sure if the theater missed a reel or what but I find it odd that even though I hated this film, I feel cheated by the fact that the supposed 84 min film came in at about 60 when I watched. I'll admit I chuckled every so ofter, but for the most part the fact that all the things being spoofed were telegraphed (Who are you monster! Paris Hilton! Like Toby Macquire in Spider-man 3). Oh well. Stay away! Can anyone verify if I got gypped?",
         "This was easily one of the worst films i've seen so far this year. I was obviously made very cheaply and it really shows on the screen. The jokes are extremely childish yet I wouldn't recommend it for children as some bits are somewhat offencive..they have really missed the mark on this one which I was really hoping would be good as I usually love this style of film. Most of the gags in the film have been seen time and time again and by the end the audience was really switching off and the younger members of the audience just started throwing popcorn around as it was so bad. In short if you have to go to the cinema this weekend see something else.",
         "This was literally the worst movie I have ever seen. I am a movie buff and tend to love all sorts of movies, this movie was a waste of my time and money. They tend to use the same joke time and time again, after the first time, it's not funny anymore!! Also, Parents beware!! This is NOT a movie for children to go to. It is PG-13 but I feel anyone under 16 should not see it, in one scene Carmen Electra is laying on a table with only tomatoes covering her nipples and a slice of pizza covering her crotch. There are lots of other provocative scenes that is inappropriate for children. All in all the movie was crude, disgusting and vulgar, not funny at all except for the opening scene. Don't see it, you'll be extremely disappointed."

         "Spartan king Leonidas may have been raised the same proverbially harsh way when it come to military training as he practices mercilessly on his own baby boy Leo, in this low-budget Mel Brooks-type parody on 300, life in not so Ancient Sparta is mainly between idyllic and shamelessly orgiastic. When the Persian king of kings Xerxes demands 'just' slavish submission, his emissaries are dumped in a near-bottomless pit, so his vast army marches on Greece. After the dirty corrupt priests and oracle are bought, they commend levying an army but predict glorious death to the last men. Only 13 men turn up from Leonidas's elite guard. The first battles are of the hip-hop variety, and taking position at the narrow Thermopylae pass provides a huge strategic advantage, but a goat trail back-door is betrayed to Xerxes. Back home, true-to-his-name Traitoro sabotages vixen queen Margo's efforts, including bribing him sexually, to send a relief army."
