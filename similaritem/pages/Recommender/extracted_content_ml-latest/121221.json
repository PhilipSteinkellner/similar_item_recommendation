         "content": "Spaghetti Western with Lee Van Cleef in the mold of Sergio Leone\u2019s Man with No Name trilogy.\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 1969 and directed by Gianfranco Parolini, \u201cSabata\u201d chronicles events in a west Texas town when a black-clad gunfighter named Sabata (Lee Van Cleef) teams-up with an alcoholic ex-soldier named Carrincha (Ignazio Spalla) and an acrobatic Indian (Bruno Ukmar) to thwart the town leaders (Antonio Gradoli  & Gianni Rizzo) who want to steal $100,000 from their own bank to purchase land that the encroaching railroad will cross. William Berger plays a minstrel of dubious loyalties while Franco Ressel is on hand as the effeminate heavy. Linda Veras appears as the stock saloon babe. \r\n\r\nThis was the first of the official Sabata trilogy released in 1969-1971. There were four other Sabata films released in 1970-1972, but they were considered unofficial imitations. The only other Sabata flick I\u2019ve seen is the third imitation one, \"Dig Your Grave, Friend... Sabata's Coming,\u201d with Raf Baldassarre in the eponymous role. While that one lacked Van Cleef, the story is more compelling than this debut.\r\n\r\n\u201cSabata\u201d starts promisingly enough with a colorful cast of characters and an innovative bank robbery, but the story bogs down in the second act and tries to make up for it with an action-packed climax and typical Italo Western epilogue (think \u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\u201d). Speaking of which, \u201cSabata\u201d is reminiscent of Sergio Leone\u2019s Dollars trilogy. Van Cleef simply takes over the Eastwood role while Spalla is basically a re-dressed Tuco. \r\n\r\nThankfully, there are original elements, like the acrobatic Native and the effeminate kingpin. Still, as with most Spaghetti Westerns, the characters are cardboard-thin caricatures rather than three-dimensional people, which limits their appeal and prevents the story from having much suspense. The usual goofy absurdities don\u2019t help.   \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 51 minutes and was shot in Almer√≠a, Spain and (studio) Rome. WRITERS: Parolini and Renato Izzo. \r\n\r\nGRADE: C",

         "This is one of the most wonderfully cartoonish and over-the-top spaghetti westerns ever. The great Lee Van Cleef plays Sabata, the bounty hunter who has more tricks than Bugs Bunny. Van Cleef was born to be in spaghetti westerns. Nobody plays these roles better. He is to spaghetti westerns what Bela Lugosi is to Dracula. He is as great as ever in this movie. William Berger is superb also in the role of Banjo, the cool, laid-back, and deadly musician. He and Sabata have a similar on-again-off-again \"partnership\" to the one that Blondie and Tuco share in \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.\" Franco Ressel is perfect as the weird over-the-top villain, \"Stengel.\" The music score is excellent, especially the title tune, which is one of my favorite spaghetti western theme songs. I also really like the use of the organ in the score. It's a nice touch. All spaghetti western fans should have this movie. It's a classic of the genre.",
         "Good, exciting western action film. Some originality that's surprising -- i.e. very good acrobats. \"Banjo\" is obviously Johnny Guitar, but it's still refreshing to see in an Italian western. Van Cleef is brutal and excellent as Sabata, a bounty hunter on the make, and the story is pleasingly ironic, humorous, and without sentimentality or moralizing. Pleasing fun for fans of the genre.",
         "Lee van Cleef is Sabata, yet another one of those bounty hunters and mavericks who populate the genre. During the story Sabata however interacts with people from all social classes which makes this spaghetti-western one of the most social ones. Specific to the Sabata series are the many special weapons which are not only used by Sabata himself but also by his evil opponents. Added to the rivalry of good Sabata and bad Stengel there is a third party competitor called Banjo (William Berger) who mostly helps Sabata but also wants more than his share of the bounty. Mr. Maltin (from the Guide) obviously hasn't seen this film well. Despite playing a high stake Sabata is not a gambler. This Western is fun. Regarding the score the main theme is one of those tunes that catch you and don't give up soon. Cinematography is stylish, often with dark bluish foregrounds and natural-source(?) yellow-lighted backgrounds. 8 / 10.",
         "Lee Van Cleef stars in the first of the Sabata films. Here he plays cat and mouse games with the leaders of a town who have attempted to steal an army payroll. Sabata stops their scheme and then attempts to blackmail them for his silence, a price that climbs with each failed attempt on his life. This is a fun western full of great action, twists and wisecracks. Van Cleef is the perfect western hero, a man of few words (and most of them smart ass remarks) he is clearly up to something, although what it is is never fully apparent. He is enjoyably helped by Carrincha a large civil war hero who is forever broke, and his pal a tall silent acrobat. The pair make for one of the best sidekick teams I've ever run across. Also wandering through the film is William Berger as Banjo, a man of decidedly mercenary loyalties, who is Sabata's equal in cracking wise, and who is forever waiting for the right angle to act act upon. I really liked this movie a great deal, even if it really isn't clear whats going on at times. The main flaw of the movie is that after the first twenty minutes the film simply becomes attempts to blackmail the town fathers by our hero and their attempts to kill him. There's nothing wrong with this since the see saw battle is excellently done, rather it just engenders a sense that you're missing something since you would think something more should be happening. Definitely one of the better westerns of I've seen. This should be something that those with a desire for good action should seek out.",
         "I tried for a long time to get this film on a good dvd (a japanese boxed set that is now out of print). I love spaghetti westerns and this is one of the best after the Leone films. Very toungue in cheek but still fun and action packed. I can't believe this isn't readily available, not even on VHS. Lee van Cleef was excellent. I wish there were stars like him around today but it seems he's part of an era that is gone forever. Dig those Zoom shots!!",
         "Several spaghetti westerns inspired a number of sequels focussing on a particular kind of shady hero. Beside the widely known \"man with no name\" there are (amongst others) Django, Sartana, Ringo, Spirito Sancto and this one, Sabata. Sabata is partly inspired by 'For a few dollars more', since Lee van Cleef plays the bounty hunter Sabata as a character with similar features to his Colonel Mortimer. Especially noticeable is his collection of shooting gadgets. Western fans are used to the never-reload always-hit one-mile -range magic revolvers of classic westerns. In this film, Sabata wins a shoot-out by simply staying out of the range of his opponents revolver and shooting him with one of his long-range weapons. Despite being a bounty hunter, Sabata has his peculiar code of honor, as opposed to the villain of the piece, the sleazy rich land owner Stengel, played superbly by Franco Ressel. As you might expect there is little doubt how it will all end but director Parolini keeps us guessing about Sabata's next moves. A superior spaghetti western.",
         "Superior Italian Western, recently released in England as a Region 2 DVD. Lee Van Cleef stars as one of those ubiquitous bounty hunters with questionable ethics and impossibly accurate gunplay seeking reward money. He teams up with a former partner named Banjo (William Berger ÔøΩ he plays a banjo, which tends to speak for him much as Charles Bronson's harmonica does in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST), a local bandit (Pedro Sanchez) and the latter's gymnastic friend Alleycat (Bruno Ukmar) to appropriate a cavalry fortune already stolen by corrupt townsfolk. The storyline meanders through a number of betrayals and allegiance shifts until all is conveniently wrapped up, in somewhat GOOD BAD & UGLY fashion. Van Cleef is excellent, as always, as is Sanchez and the supremely gorgeous Linda Veras as Berger's girlfriend, but rest of the cast is mediocre (especially the overly made-up Franco Ressel as the lead corrupt townfolk). Marcello Giombini fashions a superior musical score which is available on CD. Director Frank Kramer (Gianfranco Parolini) is adequate but unoutstanding, his directorial style fairly uninspired in this film ÔøΩ he went on to direct Van Cleef in a number of other enjoyable Italian Westerns.",
         "Except for one character (Alley Cat, the jumping Indian) and a few bits of dialogue, this film was excellent. Unlike some of the Spaghetti Westerns, it kept true to the tongue-in-cheek nature of the genre while still presenting a gritty, violent story. I particularly like the portrayal of Banjo's relationship with Jane, which accurately compares and contrasts the mercenary sides of men and women. Lee Van Cleef was, as always, always, always, excellent. Magnificent. How could Hollywood have ever neglected such a wonderful actor? Even when merely walking around a room, he commanded complete attention and gives insight into the character. William Berger couldn't have been better as Banjo. Indeed, he played the 'I'll take any side as long as I can get lots of money out of it' type of character much better than Clint Eastwood did. The dialogue goes on a bit in a few places but other than that, works very well. The music is not exceptional, but the main theme is catchy and for all its 'pop music' somehow fits the film.",
         "Gianfranco Parolini's \"Ehi Amico... C'√® Sabata, Hai Chiuso!\" aka. \"Sabata\" is a stylish and excellent Italian Cult Western starring one of the greatest Western icons of all time (THE greatest in my book), the incomparable Lee Van Cleef. Van Cleef is a blessing for any movie, and \"Sabata\" is, besides \"For A Few Dollars More\", \"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly\", \"The Big Gundown\", \"Day Of Anger\" and \"Death Rides A Horse\", one of the most important films starring this great actor. Although this film is was followed by only two sequels (one of them starring Van Cleef, the other starring Yul Brynner), the \"Sabata\" series could very well be described as the most important series of Spaghetti Westerns alongside the \"Sartana\" series starring Gianni Garko and, of course, the \"Django\" series (which isn't really a series, since \"Django\" of 1966 was followed by dozens of unofficial \"sequels\" that mostly had little to nothing to do with the original). Sabata (Lee Van Cleef) is a typical antihero of the Italian Western, who longs for money and his own benefit more than for anything else. After killing a whole gang of outlaws and bringing their loot back for the money, Sabata stays in town for a while, in order to make some more money. He soon has two sidekicks, Carrincha (Ignazio Spalla) and Indio (Aldo Canti), and he furthermore runs into an old acquaintance, the constantly relaxed banjo player Banjo (William Berger)... Lee Van Cleef is the perfect cast for Sabata, and delivers a great performance in the lead as always. Another highlight of this movie is William Berger, who is coolness incarnate as Banjo. Franco Ressel is great as the villain and Ignazio Spalla and Aldo Canti make two great sidekicks, especially Spalla is funny as hell. The movie is perfectly photographed in the Spanish Alm√©ria, the greatest location for a Spaghetti Western, and very stylish from the first minute. The score is great, especially Banjo's theme, which he constantly plays on his banjo, is a great piece of soundtrack and a very catchy tune that I'll never forget. \"Sabata\" is an essential Spaghetti Western and a great film in any aspect, and fans of the Italian Western can not afford to miss this. Highly recommended.",
         "After years of being cast as heavys and in other supporting roles (High Noon, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance), by the time Lee Van Cleef was considered a true star, it seemed he'd stick himself in all kinds of garbage for the accolade of top billing. While always giving a good performance, many of his films ARE trashy. This is not one of them... Lee Van Cleef stars as the mysterious gunslinger of the title, dressed in black. *POSSIBLE SPOILER* He's out to get the town of Daugherty's elite, who at the start of the film, rob $100,000 from an army safe to buy up the land over which the railway is gonna pass. His character here is not dissimilar from the Colonel in \"For A Few Dollars More\", as he comes fully equipped with a crack shot arsenal of weapons. In fact, I don't recall him missing once in the movie. William Berger (a spaghetti western regular) stars as Banjo, a guy who'd double cross anyone if the money was good. The character of Banjo is also enigmatic, and perhaps even more interesting than that of Sabata; it's a shame he wasn't bought back for the sequels. All in all, Sabata makes for perfect late night escapism. As a spaghetti western, it's up there with \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" and is a thoroughly enjoyable movie that keeps it's tongue firmly in cheek. If you're looking for a stylish spaghetti western outside of Sergio Leone territory, this is the one. Try to see it in widescreen."
