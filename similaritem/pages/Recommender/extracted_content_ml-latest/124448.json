      "reviews": ["Buenos Aires is under a steady rain storm that doesn't seem to go away. Alma, a young woman facing a crisis decides to take her car, and roam the streets, practically living in the vehicle. One night, during a traffic jam, a stranger, whose hand is bleeding, opens the passenger door and sits next to Alma. Taken by surprise, she is not intimidated; in fact, she appears to almost welcome the company, that is, any company at all. Alma, who had broken up with her lover, prefers the solitude, and anonymity of the streets rather than staying in a no win situation. Roberto, the stranger, happens to be also going through some painful time. Roberto is an enigma. In flashbacks we accompany Roberto to the hospital where his estranged father has died. He is a Spaniard engineer was born in Argentina, but he was taken to Spain by his mother, when he was five years old. There have been no contacts between father and son. Now that Roberto must attend to the dismantling of the old man's apartment. The only thing that interest him are the eyeglasses he finds. The old man's piano presents a problem. When the movers that are helping vacate the place refuse to take it down, Roberto decides to throw the piano from the balcony of the apartment. When they first meet, Alma and Roberto keep their distance. Later, it becomes apparent these two souls need one another. From a guarded and polite attitude, both realize there is much more to their casual meeting than really meet the eye; they are hungry for kindness and affection, which they find in one another. Paula Hernandez, the director of \"Herencia\", surprises with this intimate portrait of two loners that meet under strange circumstances and develop a mutual appreciation that turns into love. Ms. Hernandez also contributed her own screenplay. It is a film in which the rainy atmosphere in which most of the picture was set, affects Alma and Roberto in ways they, perhaps, didn't bargain for. The cinematography by Guillermo Nieto, a man that has worked with Pablo Trapero extensively, is the main asset; it creates the atmosphere for the narrative that plays beautifully against it. Same can be said of the nostalgic musical score by Sebastian Escofett that adds texture to all one sees. Victoria Bertuccelli is wonderful as Alma. This actress never makes a false movement. We have known other women like her and she rings true from the start. Unfortunately, Ernesto Alterio doesn't match the intensity of Ms. Bertuccelli."],
