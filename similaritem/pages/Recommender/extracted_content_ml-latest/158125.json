         "The music is very 19th century romantic in style and presentation. The artistic quality is very good. If you think all ballet is the \"Nutcracker and Sleeping Beauty\" type then you should see this ballet. This ballet has battle and fight scenes that are very action oriented. This is an entertaining movie and should get a wider viewing. The ballet does incorporate some traditional Chinese musical themes and instrumentation. The make up seems to be inspired by Chinese opera. This ballet may not be to everyones taste, but it should keep you awake. The basic story is of a runaway servant of a cruel landlord, who hooks up with the local women's detachment of the Peolpe's Liberation Army during the late twenties or early thirties of the 20th century. The detachment works to overthrow the evil landlord and the Nationlist army on Hainan island. No need for spoiler info because if you know anything about the arts during the Cultural Revolution you will know how this story ends.",
         "Nixon, while in China, was treated to an abbreviated performance of this ballet, and he became a fan! And why not? It's a great show. And a great score, full of emotion, catchy tunes, and real Hollywood Golden Age-style heart, enough to win over a Republican president! Because, that's what really matters in art and show biz: appealing to the audience. The Chinese Cultural Revolution was a nightmare, but in the midst of the chaos were sincere and hardworking artists who did what they could to produce the best quality productions they could, even though they were propaganda. The other outstanding film in the same vein from China at this time was 'Dongfang hong' (aka 'The East is Red'). It is to these (largely anonymous) artists' credit, and an honor to their memory, that the art in what they did survives, and can be rediscovered."
