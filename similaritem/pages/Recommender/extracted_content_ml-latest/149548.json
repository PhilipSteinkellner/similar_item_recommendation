She plays characters that are down to earth and easy to connect with. I did want to scream at her family a few times but overall I was rooting for all of the characters. This is a movie that I can totally watch again. Did I mention a shirtless Christian Keyes? This story is super cute and does not disappoint. I love how they got together in the end. I almost cried tears of joy. Another cute story and another believable class of actors. I wish more people can enjoy the movie."],
