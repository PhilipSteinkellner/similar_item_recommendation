While Amruta is lively and aggressive, Hrishi is completely the opposite. At times, Hrishi struggles to control her openness and enthusiasm. Their story takes a twist when Amruta's childhood friend Himmatrao (Siddharth Jadhav) and Hrishi's colleague Radhika (Sai Tamhankar) enter the scene. The film is adapted from Sameer Vidwans Marathi play Nava Gadi Nava Rajya. There have been umpteen numbers of films exploring a troubled marriage. However, this thought would hardly cross your mind while watching debut- ant Sameer Vidwans' Time Please due to the fresh take on the subject. The film succeeds in highlighting the real issues a married couple faces in today's time in a mature manner."],
