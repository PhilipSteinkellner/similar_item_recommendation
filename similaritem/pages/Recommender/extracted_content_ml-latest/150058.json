He gets in a lot of trouble and deals with it in a very down to earth kind of approach. The acting is quite ok, the time in which the story is set is depressive, which makes doctor Vlimmen very enjoyable as a sort of rebel in this narrow minded environment. If you understand Dutch this film is worth watching, if only for the dialect being spoken..."],

His socially more acceptable colleague Dr. Treeborg, who cares less for the animals and their rather poor owners, is thus more likely to be appointed at the public slaughterhouse and thus made untouchable, and both vets prepare legal action against each-other, thus involving Vlimmens only friend, a lawyer with whom he regularly visits Antwerp."],
