He decides to step outside his Beijing courtyard to check up on his brood. First Guan tries to look up his photographer son Hao (Chen He, Running Man), who hasnt called in a while. When he arrives at Haos atelier in Tianjin, he finds it long deserted. Next stop is Hanzhou, where eldest daughter Qing (Yao Chen, Firestorm,) is a successful commercial director & is married to a successful surgeon, but her absentee behavior towards their son suggests Guans own parenting style. Guan then moves on to Shanghai to see his son Quan (Shawn Dou, Wolf Totem), but is appalled to find hes left his day job and apartment to launch a startup with other hipsters. Guan arrives in Macau to visit his youngest daughter, Chu (Ye Qianyun), whom he and his wife groomed to be a ballerina since childhood, but is evasive about both her dance career and her suggestive relationship with a bosom friend (Zhang Xinyi, Uncle Victory). As Guans relationships with his children appear to unfortunately divulge much of their true nature, a secret the siblings are withholding may unveil the honesty and compassion thats been missing from Guan and his children.",

      "reviews": ["This Chinese movie marks the third time this story was done. Robert DiNiro did a movie a few years back with the same title, that movie was based on an Italian movie with the same premise. A retired man who just lost his wife is expecting his adult children to come visit him, but they all blow him off, so he packs his bags and visits them instead. In his journey he discovers that his kids are keeping secrets from him and putting up a front to hide their unhappiness over what seems just fine on the surface. The biggest difference between the American one and this one is where the movie takes place, although It's slightly more dramatic and a little more hopeful than the American version about the importance of family. If you did see the American version and liked that than watch this one cause it's pretty much the same."],
