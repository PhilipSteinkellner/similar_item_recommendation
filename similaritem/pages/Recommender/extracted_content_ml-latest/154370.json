         "Kiss and Run fascinates through a simply but beautiful plot. Emma knows Max for nearly all her life ... but something misses. Her 'career' as an actress is not worth calling it a career and at her 25th birthday the realizes, that something has to change in her life. I saw this film without any expectations and was really surprised. The dialogues feel really good and so does the whole scenario. Sure there are some foreseeable situations. But does this really matter? Answer: No. The characters are lovable and there were many situations for me to think of my own life. Conclusion: A very sensitive, lovable Film with some laughs and many situation to reflect your own existence. :) i gave 8/10 ... though i think points are not really able to evaluate the experience of a movie.",
         "I was quite astonished when this film turned out to be better than I had expected. It is, after all, a low-budget film, and the unobtrusive and all but exceptional plot was carried by the formidable cast. Ken Duken plays his role with brilliant understatement and I still catch myself chuckling when I think back to the scene in which Duken makes a connection between world soccer championships and the phallocratic society we live in. I hadn't heard of this film before and it definitely wasn't a film that went through the media. But I still believe that German cinema would be better off if it produced more of these low-budget productions with a charming little story and serious actors instead of making all these American CSI/Silence of the lambs/Seven knock-offs. I wish there were more films like these."
