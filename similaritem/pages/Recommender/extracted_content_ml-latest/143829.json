         "I saw this film in a theatre when it came out and have never forgotten it. It is simple and realistic and presents a situation everyone will identify with. The main character, played by Gassman, lives a contented life with a beautiful wife, friends and a comfortable if boring job as a civil engineer. Then, he happens upon a chance to make a fortune. He has inside information, so it's a sure thing. All he needs to do is raise a good deal of money. First, he borrows from his friends, but doesn't get enough. Then, he borrows from others, getting more and more desperate. This progression is realistic and believable, so much so that one can feel his panic as this golden opportunity seems to be slipping away. He sinks to lower and lower depths in his borrowing. I won't tell you how this comes out, but I will tell you it's a powerful film that you will remember as long as you live, as I have. It's a pity that such a fine film shouldn't be available on VHS or DVD. If you have a chance to see this film, don't miss it. If you know someone in the videotape industry, write to them and urge them to put this film on video. It's a rare film to treasure.",
         "Mauro Morassi best movie il SUCCESSO, was also his last of a short career, as he died in a car accident when he was only 40. I believe this one to be one of the most overlooked Italian comedies of the sixties and surely needs to be watched and appreciated again (hopefully they will release a DVD). It tells the story of a 38 years old married man who is living the \"Boom\" years, when many people at his age were already making a fortune and living (showing off) at the highest standards. His frustration keeps growing as he desperately looks for some money to be able to secure a deal he became aware while at work in his office. Dialogues, acting, characters, music, photography, everything works perfectly well. The ending is a bitter one, but also the only one the main character was inevitably aiming for. Nowadays we are not living in an economic \"Boom\" as it was back in the post war period, but sadly enough the superficiality of the main character and his desperate need to become rich and show off has boomed in Italy thanks to some well known rich media tycoon whose fortunes and mentality has become the example to follow... A Great movie to rediscover, still effective today as it was at his release!"
