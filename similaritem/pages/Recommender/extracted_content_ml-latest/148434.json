         "As a fan of the \"Eating Out\" Franchise, I was very excited to see the fourth installment on the LOGO channel. However, all of the elements that made the first three enjoyable to watch simply weren't there. In fact the only thing that Eat Out 4 (EO4) had in common with the first three EO's, other than some of the cast members, was bad acting. In the first three episodes of EO, I could look past the terrible acting because I liked the story lines of \"Nice, Boy Next Door gets the A-list Hunk\" because what's important was what was inside or because true love won out. In some cases, it was that the Boy Next Door got to play with the hot straight guy, in others it was the A-list guy dumps another A-lister with a shallow personality for a Boy Next Door who had charm and a wonderful personality. You always had somebody you were routing for to get the great guy. However, in this last installment, the couple you thought would grow old together,Zack and Casey broke up. Why??? Because the Boy next Door, Casey didn't feel he was good enough for the A-lister Boyfriend, Zack and because Zack found somebody he thought was cuter. Their relationship didn't seem to be in trouble. It might have gotten into a bit of a rut, but every relationship slides into a routine. That is not cause to break up at the first site of a hot hunk. This film fed into the stereotype that gay men are only into the physical aspects of men and that they could never have a lasting relationship because something new and hotter would eventually come along. Yes, yes, this is a comedy, but the only thing that made the first three entertaining except the cute guys, was the story line. I left the movie feeling that I no longer liked the Casey character because he had so little self respect and self esteem that he gave away his boyfriend because he didn't think he was good enough. I also ended up hating the Zack character because when Casey said he wanted to break up with him because Zack liked the new guy, he never once protested. He immediately went on to make out with the new guy. So why would I ever watch another sequel that involved these two characters? After bashing the film for all of the bad things, there was one little part of the storyline that I did like. Transsexual and the straight guy infatuation and buddy romance felt real and the Trans girl was a real beauty. Unfortunately, she was not enough to carry the movie.",
         "I hated the original \"Eating Out\". Unfunny and stupid full of annoying characters. However I loved part 2 and 3. These were funny, had plenty of male nudity and man on man kissing. What happened here? This follows gay lovers Zach (Chris Salvatore) and Casey (Daniel Skeleton) going to drama camp. There gay Benji (Aaron Milo) falls for Zach but pretends he's str8 so as not to hurt Zach and Casey's relationship...which is already falling apart. Then hunky Beau (Ronnie Kroell) falls for Casey...and loves sleeping in the nude. Str8 guy Luke (Garikayi Mutambirwa) falls for Lily (Harmony Santana)...but she's in the process of turning from a man into a woman and Luke is scared to ask her out. OK--this was just dreadful. Boring and stupid full of unfunny humor and boring drama. The movie just drags on and on and on. Most of the acting isn't bad but Drew Droege was VERY annoying as Dick Dickey. On the up side the cast was young and appealing; there's plenty of hunky shirtless guys; plenty of hot guy on guy kissing; a pretty damn explicit sex scene between two hot guys where actor Milo bares his attractive body and some full frontals--courtesy of Kroell and ex-porn star Steven Daigle (who looks GREAT for his age). There's also a musical number which is full of energy and quite amusing. But the boring script and unfunny comedy makes this a chore to watch. If it weren't for the hot guys, sex and full frontals this would be unwatchable. I can only give it a 2.",
         "I really want to like each new installment of the Eating Out series. I really truly do. I appreciate the work that goes into making a feature film and this series is pretty much the only one of its kind, the gay romantic comedy series. But they're just getting progressively worse and worse. The formula is getting entirely repetitive and in this fourth installment the repetition is literal, with the constant re-doing and re-doing of a scene from \"The Taming of the Shrew\". It's like the film is on its own internal loop. A character has a breakthrough in one scene and in the next they're right back where they started, as if the first scene never happened. I struggle through one scene and I literally have to stop the film to gather myself up enough to get through the next one. The man-candy is great but I can see screen caps on the Internet. I know the next film is already in the can, but if there's going to be a part 6 then Brocka needs to take a break, regroup and rethink his approach.",
         "Because the only moments that were funny in the slightest were due to Mink Stole doing her Dirty Old Lady shtick. There were a few halfway decent dramatic scenes by Daniel Skelton - who's much improved from the last movie - and Garikayi Mutambirwa as their characters dealt with their respective romantic troubles. However, Chris Salvatore's acting and singing have gotten worse (not helped by his apparent new venture as a Fonzie impersonator) and it's painfully obvious most of the supporting cast were chosen based solely on what they look like with their clothes off. I appreciate that the script tried to deal with trans issues in a relatively sensitive and informative manner, but Harmony Santana was barely intelligible and seemed to be in a heated competition with Ronnie Kroell for a Razzie award. (Seriously, the actual porn star they cast was a more natural actor than either of those two.) The downward spiral of this movie series has me wondering if Q Allan Brocka is our generation's Ed Wood.",
         "I think this film is a pretty good follow up to the last 3 Eating out series. This film is a typical gay cheesy guilty pleasure film but trust me these kind of films are also needed in addition to some serious thoughtful cinema. Sometimes asa viewer I don't want to think too much and just want to be entrained. And this film very successfully did that. And not just entertainment, this film has a pretty good helping of eye candy as well which by now you have started to expect from the eating out films. In this series, the gang heads out for a special thetarical camp headed by experienced Dick Dickey, a weird dude who hasn't had sex for 7 years now. He has one rule hat there will be no sex on the camp for the duration of the camp which in turn only builds up the sexual tenion. Casey and Zack are going through a rough patch in their relationship. The situation worsens when Zack has instant attraction for another camper Benji. Benji initially comes out too strong towards Zack but he pretends to be straight the moment he figures out that Zack has a boyfriend. The duo are signed up for a Shakespeare modern twist on a story where they are supposed to pplay gay lovers. The film focuses on how both casey and Zack have to come to terms with the fact that there relationship is almost over and is time for them to move on. We also have Jason , the straight director who is starting to fall for Lilly, the transgendered girl. Of course, the film ends with everything fit and fine in place, new friendships, relationships made and a hot sexy camp finished. As said above, the film is an over the top raunchy comedy which tickles your humour cells in the right places. There are so many places where I just burst out laughing. It will be very difficult to put them all here but trust me they were funny. Most actors in the film are supposed to look smoking hot which they do. As far as acting is concerned, they fit well in the realm of this movie but the real test would come if they did something more, outside this to explore their acting abilities. The surprise part of the film was Lilly's character. I am glad that the filmmakers decided to keep this angle as well because not many people have dealt with this subject. This film is a total guilty pleasure whose aim is just for fun with its many witty one liners.",
         "Let me preface my summary by saying first that I'm a huge fan of the \"Eating Out\" movie series. I think they are funny, witty, sexy and entertaining. I'm not quite sure what happened with the fourth installment though. \"Eating Out: All you can eat\" left me starving for more. I was so sexcited for the 4th installment and unfortunately it was a huge flat plain pancake for me. No syrup to sweeten the taste. Chris Salvatore and Daniel Skelton just don't have the presence of the original male cast that were used in parts 1 and 2. They are like splenda to sugar, sure some say it's just as sweet with no calories but really it just leaves a bad aftertaste in your mouth and sometimes it's best to just have sugar cause it's sweet and adds flavor to the dish. Sure Chris Salvatore is cute but there are a lot of gay men that are cute that can act and sing(sorry Chris but you're not great at either). Daniel Skelton is nowhere near as adorable as Jim Verraros and Jim was actually funny and had presence. Now lets talk about the absence of Rebeka Kochan. Q Allen, what were you thinking? She has made the series a gay monumental landmark. Without her this series would simply not be as entertaining. She is hysterically funny, wonderfully attractive and provides the type of camp that can actually cause you to laugh out loud. Without her part 3 would have went off our plates straight to the garbage pail. I always look forward to watching \"Tiffany\" and her crazy antics. Even her lines in this movie were not done as well. I think Chris is adorable but it's time for a new cast with the exception of Rebekah of course. It's also time for funnier scripts. I think the formula of 1 and 2 worked and should be kept and perhaps making the scenes hotter would help. Its important too that the cast be a small intimate group of talented hotties. When you add too many people like in drama camp it simply does not work and this movie is proof of that. I say cut the cast down to Rebekah and rebuild from there! I want to see \"Eating Out 5: Decadent Desserts\" with a hot cast and an amazingly funny script. Please Q Allen Brocka (sorry if I misspelled) i know you can do it! Scrapt whatever script you are currently in and lets start fresh!! \"Eating Out 6: Tossed Salads\" May be in the future but for now all that remains to be seen. I just want to say if \"drama camp\" was any proof of what's to come I think I'll be skipping supper all together.",
         "This film is about Casey and Zack going to a summer drama camp to learn acting. Soon enough, they find out they get a lot more than acting lessons. \"Eating Out: Drama Camp\" is a pleasant surprise. I like the plot a lot, as it is full of bubblegum, lighthearted happiness. It is a film to sit back and relax, then enjoy, laugh and have a good time. Apart from the brain off entertainment, there are deeper subplots of self acceptance, courage and the heart to let go when love is gone. It can bring a tear to your eyes among all the laughter. That's the beauty of \"Eating Out: Drama Camp\", and I really like it. I am already looking forward to the next \"Eating Out\".",
         "Guys please read this review OK I hav heard all the criticism n I agree with almost all. Starting with ,its a comedy deprived movie, yes I agree it isn't as much funny as eating out all you can. In fact I wouldn't hesitate to admit it isn't funny at all but that doesn't mean that its boring.. its a very charming movie.. I am biggest tiffiny fan and almost everyone will agree that 3 part of series is the best because of tiffiny and that factor is missing in this part and in last one also ( open weekend). So yes director of this movie is an idiot or must hav left his brain somewhere else wen he was directing this movie. Yes this movie is homoerotic movie. And lastly may be you will find make over of crew highly disappointing. But I wouldn't completely agree to this one. In fact I believe deniel( casey) has improved a lot. Now some positive part. The theme of this movie is amazing! !!! Its very romantic with Shakespeare touch to it... OK many guys find the ending of movie ridiculous or dissatisfying ( alert spoiler ahead). Just because at the end zack not going with casey doesn't make the movie bad. In fact it is the heart of the movie.. love isn't all about holding tight.. its also about letting go and sacrifice. I love the part when casey let go of zack even when zack assure him that he wouldn't cheat, because he knew holding zack back wouldn't be correct thing to do.. This movie is one of its kind.. many believes that casey in this movie is a low self esteem guy but thts not true.. many heterosexuals can also co-relate with that feeling of insecurity when your partner is way hot than you. People gets disappointed when they see one side of the movie that love is weak in front of looks but they don't see the other side that love is way to strong when it come to sacrifice. Apart from love between homosexual and all homoerotic things this movie has a very unique storyline of love between a straight guy and a transsexual, and feelings of a transsexual.. missing this movie could be your big mistake... and for those who still think the ending is dissatisfying please watch the last part ( open weekend) you will be satisfied.",
         "I loved the trilogy. The main characters were always quirky and funny, not to mention sexy. Where was Tiffany!? She was in the film for about 5 seconds and then left us with poor acting and jokes that were so corny, unfunny, and not even camp enough to call this a camp film. We need less characters, better jokes, more plot development, less plot holes (where the heck did what's his name's talent for copying others' voice come from?), and more guy-on-guy action, please. This is a stain on the otherwise pristine bed sheet that was the Eating Out series. Please Alan, check your script before you wreck your future films! One very unsatisfied Eating Out fan.",
         "It turns out, pretty awful. I have not seen the others in this series and now I won't. I value my life. A horrible waste of money, time and film. The screenplay simply stinks. The dialog trolls like paddling a canoe in an ocean of mud. The characters are one dimensional cookies. Only the role of the trans-gendered woman has a prayer of being interesting. It lurches from awful scene to sex scene to awful scene like you are on a see-saw. The only thing missing is a cameo from Jonathon Groff. I understand this was all filmed at some California youth camp that later was able to remodel their cabins. They must have been desperate for money to allow these people to memorialize their facility. \"Dick Dickie's Drama Camp?\" How freaking corny can you get? Now maybe if they turned it into a vampire flick and dredged up the ghost of Vincent Price, they might have had a shot. In the end I found myself not asking \"how\" it would end but--when.",
         "I say watch it. Just experience it. Just stop comparison to the first one then you can enjoy it. Chris Salvatore acts really cute and his voice is really good.The song Drama queen is really dumm but his other songs are really hot. Daniel Skelton really does a nice show and the others are also good. The songs during the end are really cute and kinda catch. I must say I really am a huge appreciator of Harmony Santana. She really does act like real . Watch her film the \"Gun Hill Road\". You will really like this Watch \" Dirty Love \" by Chris . It really touches you If you really want to compare it to 1st and 2nd I say this one has a story while the other ones are kinda about sex attraction and a little cute actors faces. I must say nothing compares to the part of JIM Verraros. He is talented Give this one also a small chance Casey (Daniel Skelton) and Zack (Chris Salvatore) both attend a film camp called Dick Dickey's Drama Camp. Their relationship is placed in jeopardy when Zack is teamed with Benji (Aaron Milo) to produce The Taming of the Shrew. Real hot and cool one You may be addicted to the sequel If that is the case then just see this",
         "i love these movies i watched the open weekend last night with the boyfriend and it was sweet cute as just the best i love all of them apart from the first eating out they made i really wish Tiffani was in it more Rebekah kochan is the funnest girl ever she would be the best fag hag ever she plays a great roll also love Casey hes amazingly cute and makes it really good love every one that has been in it drama camp mad ME upset cause the couple broke up but in the open weekend they got back together :) yippy the tranny is awesome to and the new fag hag in training hahaha i only found out about the movies only 2 years ago and so glad i did x",
         "The first eating out movie that I've been watched is ''eating out all you can eat''. and it was good and it was funny too the story is so great and might really happened in the real life. two thumbs up But.... When i watched this one. the story is so good too but i think its just too shallow for me. it looks like a cheap crap movie. the movie was like its not gonna happen in real life. it it was so exaggerated....well what are we expecting....this is a comedy movie that's why they made it exaggerated but it doesn't fit with the prequels of the movie which had so much sense and where we can pick up a good moral specially ''eating out all you can eat''. This one might contain spoiler......I'm just curious why Zack and Casey had just moved on within a small time and had s*x with some other guy... it was like its fine with them to broke up after all what sacrifices and dumbness they made in ''eating out all you can eat movie''. and another thing what happened to ''Tiffani'' where shed go in the movie. shed gone like a bubble that pops without even us knowing. when i watched this eating out sequel it was like adopted to the movie ''American pie'' which those guys ready to be jerk just to have s*x but we can pickup moral lessons in all American pie movie unlike this sequel it runs out about s*x s*x s*x... no originality at all and we cant even get a moral story. I love the casts specially Chris and Rebekah. I love eating out movies but the director of this film ruins it all. I'm so disappointed. And guess what....the director of this movie is also the director of this sequel. well let me watch ''eating out the opening weekend'' and let me find out if its also sh*t movie like what the director made in this movie. I wish that Glenn Gaylord was the one who directed it the one who directed ''eating out all you can eat''."
