            "content": "From director André Øvredal (Trollhunter) comes one of the best horror movies of 2016, The Autopsy of Jane Doe. Suspenseful, clever and creepy from start to finish this horror movie follows the story of father and son (played by Brain Cox and Emile Hirsch), both coroners, as they experience unexplained and paranormal events while examining the body of an unidentified woman (played by Olwen Kelly). Execution is superb, from directing, editing, camera-work, color grading, sound editing, dialogue. Movie also features some fine acting, most notably from Brian Cox (no surprise there) There is not a single moment where I felt bored, tension is always present and creepy atmosphere makes it very enjoyable. Also scares don't feel forced but rather real and well earned. Maybe couple of shortcomings or sins here and there prevent it to be a masterpiece, but it is still a very damn good movie. Simple story skillfully executed. Horror is not dead, it is still here and very alive, you just need to have passionate and talented people working behind the cameras.",

Actually, no films are different these days, but it has succeeded to shape differently with an already known platform. Except the small parts of the opening and the ending, the rest of the story takes place in a postmortem room and its building. It is a one night story and revolves around two characters, a coroner father and his assistant son. After receiving an unidentified body to examine, the son decides to stay back with his dad by dropping out the plan to go a date with his girlfriend. As the procedure begins, the night goes on. But at the half way through, they begin to experience the strange events. And once it goes beyond their hands, they try to survive the threads that come their way which pretty much the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nA short and sweet horror. I mean no sweet, but very effective theme. There are lots of things you won't understand, even the film does not explain them for us. But if you sit back and think about them after you have watched it, you would get many perspectives, like about the corpse, and what happened at the end. I could have revealed mine in here, but it would only spoil your watch if you are yet to see it. Overall, there's nothing serious you are going to miss any details. Except one question that nobody sure about is who is/was Jane Doe, I mean her background story that linked to this film event. Only a prequel would explain that. So I hope they make one quickly. Meantime, don't miss it if you're looking for a decent horror film. Because it's much better that any recent horrors.\r\n\r\n_7/10_",

         "I'm a big horror fan and this is the best little horror yarn I've seen in ages. Well acted, with some recognisable faces. Brian Cox is great as the small town coroner that leads the autopsy on the titular body, in one scene he even managed to give me a sad lump in the throat which was an unexpected feeling during an unnerving horror flick. Emile Hirsch plays his son and assistant and though he's good doesn't have as much impact as Cox. Roose Bolton (Michael McElhatton) makes an appearance as the town sheriff. Where this film really succeeds is in doing something a lot of modern horror has forgotten about - it toys with the viewers imagination, creating an uneasy feeling out of the narrative, half light, sound and shadow. This is not to say you don't get to see anything grotesque or unsettling, as certain scenes are not for the squeamish. I don't want to spoil the story but will say this, the resolution is not quite as good as the build up. It's very hard for a horror film, especially one that plays on fear and the imagination, to deliver a conclusion that is suitably unsettling - this one half succeeds. But the ride is more than worth it and the ending is far from a failure. If you like horror, watch this.",
         "While investigating the murder of a family, Sheriff Sheldon (Michael McElhatton) and his team are puzzled with the discovery of the body of a stranger buried in the basement that does not fit to the crime scene. He brings the corpse of the beautiful Jane Doe (Olwen Kelly) late night to the coroner Tommy Tilden (Brian Cox) and requests to have the cause of death until the next morning to have an answer to the press. Tommy's son and assistant Austin Tilden (Emile Hirsch) is ready to go to the movie theater with his girlfriend Emma (Ophelia Lovibond), but he decides to stay to help his father in the autopsy. Along the stormy and tragic night, they disclose weird and creepy secrets about Jane Doe. \"The Autopsy of Jane Doe\" is a creepy, claustrophobic and scary low- budget horror movie. The screenplay is very well-written and the tension increases as long as the mystery about Jane Doe is discloses by the coroners. The limited use of special effects is another plus in this little gem. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): Not Available",
         "And a simply wonderful throwback to the 1970s when horror was, well, horror -- and not based on gimmicks like \"found footage\" but rather genuine scene-setting, story building, audience engagement, and full-tilt creepiness. Probably destined to become a classic. Brian Cox is this generation's Donald Pleasence, that is to say, a character actor who could not give a bad performance if he tried yet is destined to never actually stand out in any single production because that is his style. Director André Øvredal is one of those rare finds -- an auteur with (so far) a small body of work who is producing better and better films. This suggests that over time he will probably give us bigger and better treats to come. And while Ophelia Lovibond does not get a lot of screen time, the exposure she does have will only add to her fan base. An American accent so natural you would think she was trained by Hugh Laurie and a performance so sweet you might not even recognize her (unless you looked twice) as the very same actress that underpinned an entire season of Elementary. Recommended? This is a must-see!",
         "Saw this at the Night Visions festival in Helsinki, November 2016. What I expected was a lighthearted, \"father and son as morticians\" kind of movie. What I got was a movie that chilled even my horror movie veteran soul to the bone. To explain too much about this movie would spoil it, so I will not go into details. But the director succeeds wonderfully in first creating a comfortable atmosphere, introducing a small cast of characters and setting the scene, and then masterfully starts upping the discomfort levels of the situation, until you are sitting at the edge of your seat, biting your nails. Like in Øvredal's former movie, Troll Hunter, what you cannot see can be a million times more disconcerting than what is in plain sight. Although here he uses both.. Great characters, great atmosphere, an overall great experience. Even if at times I wished for it to end already, just because I couldn't quite bear all the anxiety. I hope this comes to Finland proper, so others can see it too! Quite possibly the best horror film I have seen this year.",
         "From director André Øvredal (Trollhunter) comes one of the best horror movies of 2016, The Autopsy of Jane Doe. Suspenseful, clever and creepy from start to finish this horror movie follows the story of father and son (played by Brain Cox and Emile Hirsch), both coroners, as they experience unexplained and paranormal events while examining the body of an unidentified woman (played by Olwen Kelly). Execution is superb, from directing, editing, camera-work, color grading, sound editing, dialogue. Movie also features some fine acting, most notably from Brian Cox (no surprise there) There is not a single moment where I felt bored, tension is always present and creepy atmosphere makes it very enjoyable. Also scares don't feel forced but rather real and well earned. Maybe couple of shortcomings or sins here and there prevent it to be a masterpiece, but it is still a very damn good movie. Simple story skillfully executed. Horror is not dead, it is still here and very alive, you just need to have passionate and talented people working behind the cameras.",
         "Since wishi washi pseudo horror films ala insidious and co dominate the genre at the moment i never expect much when watching a new entry.And much to my surprise Jane Doe is a REAL horror film in finest John Carpenter b-movie tradition. Jane Doe starts out strong, builds atmosphere with genuinely creepy scenes and manages to keep its mystery and secrets just long enough to satisfy. Much of this is due to the moody music which probably made half the film! Sure there is the occasional i-already-know-whats-coming-next/ clichéd shock scene, but such sins are easily forgiven within seconds since the intense atmosphere of this film pulls the viewer back in mercilessly. If you appreciate classic oldschool flicks like John Carpenters 'The Fog', Jane Doe will not disappoint. Go see it!",
         "After the police discover a corpse in a shallow grave, they take it to father-and-son coroners Austin and Tommy Tilden. During their invasive examination, the duo comes into realization that they are dealing with something supernatural. The Autopsy of Jane Doe - Was a visual treat to enjoy. I think if you are a fan of well paced films you will enjoy this one. Although it's being treated as a horror film - Which is not a problem unless you generalize this as the overall genre for this movie - Its more of a Suspense Thriller/Drama/Horror. This is not something I feel needs to be clarified, but understood as the film envelops all three entities. Emile Hirsch and Brian Cox are excellent as father-and-son coroners Austin and Tommy Tilden. One particular moment in the film allows the actors to reflect and truly shine in their respected roles. André Øvredal (Trollhunter) directs this close quartered film with limited room for our actors to breathe once the tension unfolds - He makes great use of this tension by placing the camera in dark areas allowing us to truly feel the weight of the actors. Screenwriters Ian Goldberg and Richard Naing craft a smart and well paced story with a few false scares, and flat third act leaving us yearning for more. Overall, this is a movie that deserves and requires your time :)",
         "This movie's story isn't actually a bad idea! I love the fact that it's about a topic that isn't too cliché, however, the small predictable scenes kind of ruined the fun. Things that didn't need to happen that did: - Girlfriend didn't really need to be accidentally axed to death, there was minimal reaction to this and it was so unrealistic - Cat didn't need to be found mangled, then within 2 seconds, receive a neck snap, no questions asked, again with no realistic reaction from characters - Morgue bodies didn't really need to start walking about again like zombies - Being trapped in a storm without electricity or signal on the phone (obviously) Things that needed to happen that didn't: - More history on the witch - More cool facts about the dates and possibilities of what happened to the witch - Tie the loose ends about her links with the characters she was involved with I loved the music, the unusual scenes, the CSI style findings and whatnot, I wish there had been more story and less jump scares.",
         "I've not seen an original horror this well done for a long time. The cast is strong, dialogue and acting good, the story is interesting, well paced and well directed. If you didn't know better, you may think after the first third of the film that you were watching a forensic crime, and would be quite happy to continue watching in that vein. Instead, an unsettling, atmospheric, claustrophobic tale of magic, sacrifice and revenge unfolds, which I was more than happy with. The direction is outstanding, your imagination does a lot of the work and the budget is saved for some very well done major scenes (and of course, quality actors - unfortunately rare in horror these days). Whereas it would have been wonderful to tie up the loose ends, see a bit about the Witch Trials history, give Hirsch and Cox a bit more to go on earlier in the film etc. With that said, it may have removed something from the very polished whole, and in all likelihood will yield a - well deserved - sequel. Jane Doe sure as Hell hasn't finished yet! It's got that \"Sinister\" vibe about it, and is certainly one of the best horror releases of the year. I challenge anyone to watch this and not feel impressed, satisfied and maybe just a little bit scared.",
         "After watching the trailer of this film i was just expecting another lazy cheesy horror film, and i knew it was a movie i'd skip. But after seeing some good reviews here and there about it, i thought i'd give it a try and watch it with an open mind. Turns out to be one of the best horror films to come out this year (Along with Lights Out, Under The Shadow and Don't Breathe) Just consider that this movie is not for the faint heart at all as it contains very graphic scenes that aren't suitable for everyone, but the title says it anyway it's an Autopsy. What I liked the most about this film is that it has everything horror fans would like to see in a movie, it has very disturbing scenes, top- notch suspense , good scares , an atmosphere that will suck you in and a creepy enough story that'll probably keep you up at night thinking about dead bodies The film starts slow with the horror but it never keeps you bored, it's always interesting and you always wanna know how things will go, and as you watch you'll notice it's getting weirder and weirder and then you'll feel so uncomfortable watching it until you reach the top speed of the horror and then it will come to an end. The ending could've been better (thought its a bit cheesy) but it hasn't ruined the experience for me, it's still a good watch for fans of the genre. Conclusion: If you're a true horror fan you can't miss this one, pretty sure it has many in it that will give you some good scares.",
         "This particular flick restored my lost faith in horror movies. Creepy elements galore from start to finish. The idea of an animated corpse with a bell attached to its foot particularly was so hair-raising. There are no cheap scares in The Autopsy of Jane Doe. No cheap effects either. What's so nice about it is it scares the viewer from various angles -- from the claustrophobic basement setting to the fact that not much info on Jane Doe is revealed, which further fuels the mystery that pervaded the movie from start to finish. Both Emile Hirsch and Brian Cox gave stellar performances! Needless to say, The Autopsy of Jane Doe is one of the scariest, scariest horror movies I saw, and it's worth watching!",
         "First of all, I will say that this is not really a horror film to me ( in its entirety) but rather the first half and bit more is kind of a thriller / suspense movie and the last 20 minutes is a mild horror. But even if it is a real horror ( as many would say - though maybe my definition of horror is rather narrow as I can not be scared easily) it does bring something new. This is why I am rating this as an eight! That new element to the horror is what makes it good: a beauty, a dead beauty that looks like a doll outside but hell inside... The inscriptions inside her body and skin is a very awesome detail. Maybe that is one thing that will stick with me when I think of the film ... The story is simple but appealing. The three actors + the girlfriend and the sheriff are all good. But really, all hail Jane Doe ( if it was a real person whole time). I recommend it!",
         "The title and poster of the movie give a creepy and uneasy feeling to the prospective watcher, and the same creepy atmosphere is wonderfully evident from the start of this well-executed, well-acted offering from the Norwegian director who gave us the thoroughly underrated Trollhunter. This time, he opted for conventional filmmaking instead of the found-footage style he so deftly utilized in Trollhunter, giving us time to take in the brilliantly directed scenes which immediately thrusts the audience into the unsettling premise of a Jane Doe being autopsied by a father-and-son coroner duo. The dialogue between the leads in the beginning build character almost instantaneously, and they feel real from the get-go. Compared to the recent trend of horror movies eschewing character development for cardboard cutout jump-scare fuel, this movie comes as a nice and refreshing, almost surprising, change of pace. The father and the son have contrasting personalities regarding their approach to autopsies. I expected this brilliancy in dialogue and character development to carry the whole movie - and it immediately increased my expectations of the movie; I fully expected this to be an underrated horror gem of 2016. Alas, however, half-way through the movie the director's Conjuring-esque influences seemed to show through the cracks. Though not devolving straight into jump-scare territory, the movie dips its feet into schlock scares now and then, which has a very infuriating effect on the viewer who, until now, has been amazed by the movie's restraint. The character development also suffers, with some actions by the leads contradicting their motivations. However, the concept and execution need to be commended. The actors Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch do well to sell the dread and claustrophobia experienced by the characters. Special mention to Olwen Kelly, who gives possibly the best performance of the movie, despite having no lines, no action (she plays the corpse). Definitely one of the highlights of the movie was the synergy between the camera-work and the actress's facial expressions which do more to put the viewer at unease than minute-long scenes of staring into the darkness, fully knowing the movie is going to go for that cheap jump-scare. That being said, I would say the script was the weakest aspect of the movie, the ending just leaves you wanting a little bit more, and slightly disappointed. Nevertheless, the movie does its job of selling you the premise and executing it well enough to leave you unsettled for a few days. All in all, I would call this movie as a mixed bag, though I would give it a glowing recommendation as it is head and shoulders above the spate of incomprehensible scare-fests being offered by Hollywood these days. Great work, André Øvredal. Be sure to check out Trollhunter by the same director. Although not a horror film, it merges the found-footage genre with goofy mythical creatures to amazingly hilarious yet epic results.",
         "I saw this movie at night with my wife. Not knowing what to expect, I am a huge horror fan from old school Nightmare on elm street to blood and gore films like Dead Alive including a few foreign films like I saw the Devil. But in no way was I prepared for this. After 20 minutes or so I was in heart pumping suspense. I felt like a little kid watching his first scary movie. There were a few good scares but what did it was the acting, the atmosphere and that creepy face that looked so alive and not once did it blink or move. I couldn't sleep well that night and a movie has not done that to me since I was 12 years old and I am 34 years old now. Just Wow... Watch with caution.",
         "I love horror movies. The sleek ones, the b-grade ones, the really crappy ones with bad acting and cheap thrills. I watch them all. This one? This one left me pleasantly surprised. The scares are carefully crafted, the acting is superb, and the atmosphere gets you before the walking dead does. As the case with most well made horror movies, it is that which you cannot see that frightens you the most. In some ways, the setting and atmosphere reminds of the movie Pontypool. Quick summary, here be spoilers: An unidentified corpse of a woman (Olwen Kelly) is found half buried in the basement of a house where a bizarre homicide has occurred. What stayed with me, was the contrast of the messy and bloody homicide scenes, and the cleanness of the corpse and her grave. Even though half buried, she didn't even have dirt on her. They take the corpse to father-and-son coroners Tommy (Brian Cox) and Austin (Emile Hirsch) Tilden. During their examination, they come to realization that they are dealing with something supernatural. A mountain of contradictions and inconsistencies arise. The corpse has no visible signs of trauma, no rigor mortis. The eyes are cloudy, something that only happens when the body has been dead for a few days. When they make the Y-incision, the corpse bleeds profusely, something that only happens when a corpse is fresh. Her tongue has been non-surgically removed, her ankles and wrists are shattered. One of her teeth is missing, which they later find in a hex bag in her stomach. Her lungs are charred, and her organs imply repeated stabbing. Her vagina is mutilated and when they pull the skin away from her rib- cage, they find strange symbols tattooed on her skin. The first half of the movie focuses on the various, sometimes chilling, aspects of the external and internal examination. The seconds half is when lights go off and things go bump in the dark. Øvredal succeeds superbly in first creating a relaxed atmosphere, with a small cast of characters, and then starts turning the discomfort levels and the creep factor up. I would have given the movie a higher rating, but the ending did not live up to the tone that was set throughout the movie. That said, I still highly recommend The Autopsy of Jane Doe.",
         "One of the best and most original thriller/horror films for a long long time. A farther and son who are both coroners have a unidentified body turn up at there morgue, the unidentified female was found at a mass murder scene by a local sheriff. The sheriff tells them he needs to know what happened to her by the end of the night so they get to work. With strange things that start to happen during the girls autopsy who has been labeled as Jane Doe this film develops into a horror mystery so much so you can't take your eyes off the screen. Brian Cox is excellent as well is Emile Hirsch, the autopsy of Jane Doe is how a film is meant to be made not some rubbish found footage but genuine real tension and horror. Quite possibly one of the best films out this year.",
         "I have been on IMDb for over 10 years and rated over 1195 films but I have never once posted a review for any of them. For this movie I will post my first review: The films in the horror genre have become monotonous and tiring of late. We are usually offered two types of horror films: the R rated ones with a lot of blood and gore which doesn't make it scary, it makes it gross and disgusting; or the PG-13 ones that can't show too much blood and gore so they will resort to bombarding the audience with jump scares, cheap thrills, and every predictable clichés you can think of borrowed from every other horror film ever made. Then you have the characters. You will always have a group of superfluous paper thin characters in a horror movie which you know right from the beginning they are just there to get slashed, mutilated, beheaded, burned, cut up, sliced up, diced and killed a 1000 different ways. The Autopsy Of Jane Doe is different. Very little blood and gore. No clichés, no jump scares. Totally unpredictable. Atmospherically scary and tense and it's able to achieve that with only 3 main characters in the film, one of them a corpse. The story is simple: at a bloody and violent multiple murders crime scene, the police discover the body of a young woman half buried in the basement. They sent the body to the local funeral home and morgue for the father and son coroner to perform an autopsy on her and find the cause of her death. That's where the horror begins and to say more will be to give the movie away. I think the reason this movie works so well is because it's not a cookie cutter Hollywood production. It's a British production and the director is Norwegian, famous for the 2010 movie horror film Trolljegeren (Trollhunter). James Wan and James Wong! Are you paying attention? This is how a scary horror movie should be! By the way, that's a real flesh and blood live actress that plays Jane Doe, not a mannequin, and she does a damn great job playing a corpse.",
         "If you were pleasantly surprised with André Øvredal's TROLLHUNTER (2010), then you will regard him now as your new 'Master of Horror' - in this latest & his first English-language film The Autopsy of Jane Doe! Because, in Jane Doe, this Norwegian director applied almost each & every great craftsmanship of horror film-making so skillfully that you are not only going to see just another good or passable horror flick set around an awesomely interesting premise, you'll going to experience it! Through the effective use of half light, sound, smoke & shadow this time he created an utterly eerie & unsettling atmosphere by revealing not too much but keep toying with the viewer's imagination from start to finish. And the perfect cast & characterization also helps to fuel the unease feeling of an unknown terror \u2013 an untouched & unidentified corpse of a beautiful young female; the local cops discovered the body from a shallow grave under the basement of a house-where everyone was massacred! The best horror film of 2016 so far! A must see.",
         "Without spoiling this movie, let me sum up my impression after I just finished watching \"The Autopsy Of Jane Doe\". I went out without seeing the trailer, so I thought it was a police/detective movie at first. But it didn't take long for us to realize it was a horror movie. Acting : excellent. Bryan Cox and Emile Hirsh play a very believable pair of father-son, working at the family morgue. Story : very different from the usual horror movies. I appreciated it, as I grew tired of the same ghosts, zombie, vampire stories. Directing : smart use of the shadows without being excessive. I highly recommend it.",
         "Yes, I hate horror movies. I watched them in the past and I am usually disgusted by this genre of movies, rather than afraid of them. However, the title of the movie and the brief plot indicated that this should be a rather different and interesting horror movie - and it was! It was not one of those movies where seemingly smart characters make stupid assumptions or decisions, and the movie mostly kept you thinking what will happen next.The actors (including Jane Doe) were awesome 9.5/10 and the effects were good 8/10. The movie is only 1.5 hours long which is just perfect. Worth watching even if you are not a fan of horror movies! Spoiler: The only thing that I did not like was that it was clear from almost the beginning that the girl was a witch. The main characters found so much evidence that she was a witch and even listed all the evidences, but only later in the movie they admitted the fact.",
         "How we long for an actual horror story, and how rare one comes along. Early on you know you are going for a ride.. a painstaking one. There is just a subtle sense that everything is going to build up right, disturbingly, later, and you cannot just see it. There's too much hidden you cannot point them out. How could you? It takes its sweet, sweet time before you feel virtually threatened in the once-comfortable safety of your own home. You are always one step behind. You just do not want to figure it out. Try not let the anticipation turn into a frustration, to not tilt your head to see a foot away into shadows behind the door, not to literally feel the pain, inflicted with an inconceivable harm so mental you are not sure if you want to escape or fight. Try to keep calm.",
         "I went to this film with very high expectations. And for the first quarter my expectation were met. Here was a father-and-son duo that were thoroughly likable horror protagonists, and they spent a good amount of time explaining the intricacies of an autopsy. After that, the film fell flat. The horror element in the movie was surprisingly far-fetched, un- scary, and even downright ludicrous. And the fact that the father- and-son team, two very logical men who have been dissecting normal bodies all their careers, took it in their stride, is doubly ludicrous. This movie also makes some objectionable plot choices. Human sacrifice, a sad and horrific truth of past civilizations and cult groups, should not be romanticized by showing that it preserves beauty. Either that, or the director got it mixed up with vampirism? The result is, nonetheless, confusing and not in the least bit terrifying. Sadly, none of the characters, despite being likable, could leave a lasting impression as they rushed through the general 'procedure' of dealing with a horror crisis. The only thing I sympathized with in this movie was the cat. 4/10",
         "In the beginning I was surprised because the movie sounded very unique (at least I have never seen any horror movie that develops from the autopsy of q victims corpse) which I thought was hard for an horror movie as the genre feels like a broken record. However I was very disappointed at how it was all wrapped up, it's kind of lazy to wrap it up with witchcraft and call it a day. They had an original concept in my eyes, wouldn't be hard to make a crime scene reconstitution or something of the sort to make it more interesting. Also, the whole family story and cat thing seem very random and unnecessary to me, if it was to explain the fact that he volunteered to suffer for his son, well, the fact he is his son pretty much explains it, so the time spend trying to give the characters some dept wasn't used wisely.",
         "The Autopsy of Jane Doe started SO freaking well. I was enthralled right from the opening scene, which first few seconds played with perspective and focus. We are carried from a peaceful environment to a grotesque scene where I jumped a little from my seat just by the exacerbated sound of a camera flash. The photography was stellar. The detail, the angle, the light, everything was superb and simply chilling. There's a lot of play with perspective and the close-ups of simple objects contribute to the eerie atmosphere. For me, it was easily worth 5 stars till then point. When we meet our two protagonists, father and son who will perform the autopsy on Jane Doe, I was still excited and in awe. The interaction between characters was believable and I enjoyed seeing how those two handled the work and each other, Austin his father's pupil, trying to learn his father's business as best as he could. The photography was still amazing and I was immediately hooked by how familiar the creepy workplace worked. These guys could not be more normal and this was their home. Sure, it had the potential to be creepy, but it felt safe and normal, if that makes any sense. Throughout these scenes there were several suspenseful moments where the director had me slowly nudging towards the edge of my seat. I never knew if something really bad was going to happen. And the fact is, it usually did not, not in the way I am used to. There were no easy scares up to this point. There were several freaky elements that contributed to a creepy atmosphere but all in all it was a serious approach to the reality of two coroners. The gross stuff came so naturally I didn't ever see it coming until it was in my face. The sounds were so graphic that I actually gagged on more than one occasion. I really enjoyed the movie till about two thirds or so. Then it all started going downhill for me. The father's theory about what was happening seemed far-fetched, Austin annoyed the heck out of me cause he kept putting his face in harm's way and the acting or script was just bad, I still can't figure out which. I mean, who (spoiler ahead) peeks through a hole, suddenly sees a corpse looking back at him, just nonchalantly begins to figure out the next step?(/spoiler) I am ashamed to admit I shrieked in that scene because I was firmly convinced nothing would happen, considering the previous setup, and that guy does even twitch. Eurgh. Towards the end I felt like such a great work of art was being mistreated for no good reason. The film just became a mockery of what it had been until then - even though the scariest scene of the movie, for me, came then. And when I thought I could not be more annoyed, the last second of the movie proved me otherwise. I don't get it. I swear I don't get how anyone could butcher such an awesome movie, a gem amongst all other horror stuff out there. So yeah, I am still a bit upset.",
         "I'm a big horror fan and this is the best little horror yarn I've seen in ages. Jane Doe is an excellent example that good horror movies are still being made. Top notch story, effects and scares. Highly recommended. Well acted, with some recognisable faces. Brian Cox is great as the small town coroner that leads the autopsy on the titular body, in one scene he even managed to give me a sad lump in the throat which was an unexpected feeling during an unnerving horror flick. Emile Hirsch plays his son and assistant and though he's good doesn't have as much impact as Cox. Roose Bolton (Michael McElhatton) makes an appearance as the town sheriff. Where this film really succeeds is in doing something a lot of modern horror has forgotten about - it toys with the viewers imagination, creating an uneasy feeling out of the narrative, half light, sound and shadow. This is not to say you don't get to see anything grotesque or unsettling, as certain scenes are not for the squeamish. I don't want to spoil the story but will say this, the resolution is not quite as good as the build up. It's very hard for a horror film, especially one that plays on fear and the imagination, to deliver a conclusion that is suitably unsettling - this one half succeeds. But the ride is more than worth it and the ending is far from a failure. If you like horror, watch this."

He brings the corpse of the beautiful Jane Doe late night to the coroner Tommy Tilden and requests to have the cause of death until the next morning to have an answer to the press. Tommy's son and assistant Austin Tilden is ready to go to the movie theater with his girlfriend Emma, but he decides to stay to help his father in the autopsy. Along the stormy and tragic night, they disclose weird and creepy secrets about Jane Doe.",
         "In Virginia, on the crime scene in the brutally murdered Douglas' basement, the Forensics crew find the body of an almost intact, exceptionally preserved, young woman in her mid to late 20s. Furthermore, equally puzzling is also the fact that even though the house of the loving couple is riddled with evidence of mayhem, still, the cause of her death is not apparent. With the Press on his back, urging him for answers, Sheriff Sheldon seeks for help in the coroners Tommy Tilden and his son Austin, assigning them with the emergency autopsy of this beautiful, yet, enigmatic Jane Doe with the grey, cloudy eyes. In the hope that this will be just another easy case, Austin stays to help his father during the night, but then again, the peat under her fingernails, paired with her severed tongue and shattered joints and on top of that, the clear signs of vaginal trauma, strongly imply that this will not be an ordinary night. The two coroners begin to work, only to plunge themselves deeper and deeper into a world of strange occurrences and inexplicable findings.",
