Reed also has little time for new fangled politically correct ways of teaching.\r\n\r\nHowever Reed slowly bonds with the kids as he learns how to connect with them, he also falls for a fellow teacher and confronts with the Russian baddie.\r\n\r\nHowever this is straight to pay tv fodder, with a weak script. Although Lundgren can be a good dramatic actor, he is left with little to do here.",

         "While the original film was not exactly a cinematic masterpiece, it was an enjoyable movie for many different people. It worked because of Arnold's surprisingly excellent interaction with the kids. It had a balance of light-heartedness and seriousness as he flipped between his teaching job and his real job as an undercover cop looking for a witness. There were plenty of laughs, but when it was time to get serious, it actually did get intense and suspenseful. This movie is such a disappointment. The people who made it seem to have watched the original movie, but had no idea why it worked. To begin with, the villains in this movie are actually portrayed as comic relief, rather than a real threat, which completely undermines any dramatic tension in the movie. You never once feel that the kids or Dolph is in any real danger, so there is zero suspense. Nothing is at stake. His partner embodies just about every racial stereotype under the sun, which is offensive and reeks of lazy screen writing. (I'd like to say the word 'screen writing' but IMDb is forcing me to make it two words. How ironic that a site 100% dedicated to film doesn't recognize that as a word.) As much as I enjoy him in other films, Dolph seems like he's just kind of going through the motions here...it doesn't seem like he's putting forth any effort to connect with the kids or seem overwhelmed...he just gets lots of finger paint on his shirt and calls it a day. He never acts like there is any danger during the action scenes, further undermining any suspense that the audience might feel. To be fair, the script is poor, so he doesn't have much to work with. As I mentioned, the dramatic element is tossed straight out the window, making this a straight-up comedy. But, there's a problem. I don't know who would find this movie funny...maybe Adam Sandler fans? Larry The Cable Guy fans? There is a scene of a fat man getting his nuts zapped with a taser that lasts about a minute, so that should give you an idea of the level of humor that you're in for.",
         "Should there be a time limit for releasing a sequel? The original movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger came out in 1990, that's a quarter of a century ago, and now we have a sequel that doesn't even have Arnie it. What is the bloody point? I'm not sure who the intended audience Kindergarten Cop 2 is, certainly not fans of the original, so my guess it's for little kids who like pee jokes and line dancing. Wait, do kids like line dancing? So if you want to see Dolph Lundgren get peed on, wear a cowboy hat and make out with someone a quarter of his age then this could be the film for you. If you are looking for an actual comedy check to see if the original one is on Netflix. Note: The film even has the cliché angry boss who yells at our hero even though that stereotype had already been lampooned in The Last Action Hero back in 1993.",
         "I went into this movie with low expectations.i picked it up for a very low price.however,i have to say,it's actually not a bad movie.i chuckled more than a few times,and laughed out loud two or three times.it's a pleasant enough diversion.Dolph Lundgren plays the main role here,and he is pretty good in the role.he handles the comedic bits pretty well.Bill Bellamy plays his partner,and is also good.but Danny Watley is very funny as their overbearing,always shouting boss,as is Michael P.Northey as the somewhat dim witted,clueless Hal.it's a decent movie,especially if you keep your expectations low.i would recommend it for a watch.Kindergarten Cop 2 is a 6/10",
         "There is one thing radically wrong with this movie - Dolph Lundgren. I know it will seem shallow and superficial to comment on a character's make up - but Lundgren's make up was so bad, so incredibly bad, that it overwhelmed the already light story line. All I could think about were the incredibly deep facial wrinkles which made him look like a human Sharpei. At age 58 Lundgren is now a generation too old to have played this character successfully. Aside from Lundgren, this was a generic straight to video movie. There is not one new or innovative idea in the entire film. Cardboard characters and standard settings. The child actors in this movie had their moments, but they mostly came across as \"hyperactive' rather than \"cute\". The rest of the cast is so bland that you will forget who they were half an hour after the movie.",
         "Kindergarten Cop 2 (2016) ** (out of 4) Twenty-six years after the original film we're finally given a \"sequel\" and this time it's Dolph Lundgren playing FBI Agent Reed. He's trying to put an infamous crime boss in prison but a hacker has stolen a file that tells the location of everyone in the Witness Protection Program. It turns out that the information in located on a file at a Seattle school so the agent must go undercover to try and locate it. KINDERGARTEN COP 2 is a film that no one really asked for. Well, they did ask for a sequel to the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie about twenty years ago but this thing here isn't that. In fact, I'm not really sure why they put a \"2\" at the end of the title because the original film is never mentioned and for the most part his is basically just a remake. While the film isn't horrid, the thing certainly isn't good and I'd argue that in the end it's quite pointless. Whereas the first film was somewhat uneven in regards to its sometime dark tone and sometimes comic tone, there's no doubt about this film in regards to it being aimed for children. The violence is pretty much tamed down and the majority of the jokes are aimed at children. This is certainly a movie that parents could watch with their young kids as the filmmakers were going for that type of movie. There's nothing wrong with that but the problem is that this comedy contains very few laughs. Another major problem is that none of the characters are all that likable. The kid's don't have any personalities and I thought all of them lacked any sort of chemistry with Lundgren. As for the action star, he gives an okay performance here but his comic timing just isn't where it's needed to be. He does have some funny stuff with Bill Bellamy but this too starts to get watered down as the picture moves along. KINDERGARTEN COP 2 isn't horrible but there's really no point of the movie being made.",
         "Before i start i must add, i watched the whole movie with the sound out of sync. Don't ask The first 2 minutes are so intense yet so cliché, some would argue and say fake but I disagree. Old mate Dolph Lundgren as Agent Reed the FBI agent, what a life. Twist after twist, as stupid as it may seem. The brilliance of what could've been is portrayed so well, really taking it to the next level of sequels. Integrating modern day elements into the movie, in the form of a hypersensitive allergy to Dolphy's PB&J sandwich. After getting pied on, he finds the help of a pretty looking teacher that helps him out and the love story begins. My favourite part of the movie is when Dolph gets asked how he stays in such good shape, Dolph replies so you think i'm in good shape... Let me show you how i stay in shape. Boom!! line dancing in a barn decorated with a mechanical bull and people wearing cowboy hats. When you think this movie can't get any better, it does. Dolph somehow recognises that one of his students is the victim of domestic violence, he talks to her dad and shares his own personal story which makes her dad see the light. Look, i could go on but I don't want to spoil the ending. All I can say about this movie is that under the circumstances the story actually grew on me, I weirdly enjoyed it.",
         "What to expect from a sequel like this? I think it reached the highest goal it could. It's a paycheck for all involved. Dolph can have some fun (the kids too of course), if you lower your expectations to very very low, you may be able to enjoy this to a degree too. It is what it is and even if some had a lot of fun with the original (which was filmed/released a long time ago), I doubt many were yearning for a sequel. But that's how things work and if a title sounds familiar, investors are there and some people will watch it (guilty as charged, but I do watch almost anything as you can tell by my list of reviews ;o) ). So while I've seen worse (obviously), this is by the numbers ... You do the math (yes pun intended)",
         "The original was a high concept, because it had the biggest action star against toddlers who would utter the names of female appendages without a moments notice. The plot played second fiddle to Arnie Screaming at the children, and eventually bonding with them.....it was hilarious when I was fourteen. Forward 25 years, and some bright spark has decided to make a sequel, or what I like to call, put all the bits that were memorable from the first movie, put them in the narrative of this one, and see what happens. It's a clever move, because the people who enjoyed the film back then, have children, and I'm guessing its a safe bet, as it's nothing more than a carbon copy. The plot, if you would call it one, involves grizzled FBI agent Lundgren pretending to be a Kindergarten teacher to find a flash drive that could potentially put a very naughty gangster away for a long time. And it's your basic formulaic rehash. He's a loner who lives by water who exercises outside, the children are both lovable and slappable at the same time. And to begging with, they run rings around him........quite literally. Then we have a young boy say the female appendage without warning, a girl needs to pee, and instead of a ferret, there's a stalking pig. And we even have a repeat of the after who could be abusing his daughter. But instead of Arnie beating ten bells out of him, Lundgren says he will ask around for a job. Oh the sharing, caring, noughties. But it's not the disaster you would expect it to be. Lundgren puts in a decent performance, his partner has the funniest line in the film regarding ethnicity and being shot first. And it all finishes with a big smile on everybody's face, and the comedy fat man getting a taser to the nether regions. It's not going to win any awards, but it's clever enough not to try and be anything different to the original. Can't wait for the sequel to Junior starring Steven Seagal called Junior too. At least they'd save money on a fat suit....",
         "\"They're children. I can handle this.\" Agents Reed (Lundgren) and Sanders (Bellamy) are trying to find a stolen list of names. When the owner winds up dead they only have one lead, he was a teacher. With no other option Agent Reed goes under cover as a teacher in the school in hopes to find the list before more people wind up dead. The original is a borderline classic and is still funny and enjoyable to watch today. It was strange at first to see Schwarzenegger in a comedic role but his timing was great and it really worked. That's one thing this was lacking. This is really Lundgren's first real acting role, and he comes off as stiff and forced. The comic relief is left to Bill Bellamy and the supporting cast. The movie is watchable and entertaining enough but does nothing to add to the original and is a straight to video movie that should have been second guessed. Overall, watchable and entertaining but is nowhere close to being as good as the original. Another sequel that leaves you asking why this was made. I give it a C.",
         "* mild spoilers?* First, I give Dolph Lundgren full credit for trying. I like the guy, I really do ... but this movie DOES NOT WORK. The good: Bill Bellamy isn't terrible. The kids are fairly cute. The bad: Everything else. This movie lacks the charm, fun and comic touches that worked in the original, never mind that the original wasn't hurting for a sequel. I tried to like it ... but NOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Save yourselves & just watch the original!",
         "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Morning *** Friday Night ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning When a teacher is killed after stumbling upon sensitive information, FBI Agent Reed (Dolph Lundgren) is assigned to go undercover in a liberal, PC modern kindergarten, where his 'no pain no gain' philosophy makes him a far from ideal candidate for the role. Gradually, he forms a bond with the kids and pretty young teacher Olivia (Darla Taylor) and liaises with his partner Sanders (Bill Bellamy), but all the while, Zogu (Aleks Paunovic), the villainous Russian mobster behind the murder, lurks about. It's never too late to make a sequel these days, even to a more modern audience who may not even have heard of the original. Or even if it happens to be some bizarrely low budget, straight to DVD Dolph Lundgren vehicle. This is a weird, unexplainable piece of work at best, but maybe most so for Dolph. Things were looking on the up for him recently, with the well received Skin Trade signalling a return to the sort of slam bang, unpretentious entertainment he was known for. You're left to wonder what his motives for making this were: trying to show a lighter, fuzzier side to his repertoire, even if it's all little heard of, straight to DVD fodder? The original was one of two films Arnold Schwarzenegger made to try and show a lighter version of himself, and it's been confirmed he's appearing in a sequel himself to the other one of those films, so you're left to wonder if he thought the follow up to this had lesser box office potential. Even so, many will feel he brought something to the original role that couldn't be recreated by anyone else, and it's true Dolph doesn't feel at home as much here, lacking Arnie's madcap spirit in the first film. He's joined by Paunovic's typical Russian villain, Bellamy's stereotypical black partner and Taylor as a worryingly younger love interest. This is just an all round beguiling project. How did it come up? Who thought it would be a good idea? What was anyone trying to achieve with it? Why did it get made? *",
         "Alright, i saw the first movie as a kid, and it starred my (then) favourite \"actor\" in Arnold Swartzenagger. So of course as a kid i liked the first one. Nowhere near an iconic or classic as Commando, Terminator 2 or whatever, but still a good time. I picked it up years later and watch it again and my tough changed a bit. I tough it was a bit funny still but i guess its the kind of humour that work either on kids or old parents. Anyway when i saw this was released i had to give it a look. I like Dolph Lundgren, i mean sure he is a more mobile Steven Seagal, starring in the same type of scripts and same type of roles as him, usually in the same type of budget movies. But i guess i just like those b action movies... So i gave it a look and ... well... its not as bad as it may look. Despite having nothing storywise to do with the first movie it does follow a similar formula, and call it a sequel or a remake, it does not matter. Its similarly entertaining as the first one and its by no mean a \"bad movie\". But my biggest problem with it is Mister Lundgren's age. He is acting and somewhat playing the role of a 35 years old (max) dude while he clearly look in his advanced 50s at least. And of course they decided to give the supporting role to a beautiful actress that look like a barely 26 years old hottie. IMDb list her as being 29 years old. The fact is, she is way too young for Lundgren and this make the whole movie awkward and unbelievable. They could had easily go with a 39 to 43 years old good looking mature lady instead, which would had made it a bit more believable. Lets face it, Dolph does not have that much comedy background, and the movie never show how a \"badass\" he is supposed to be unlike Arny in the first movie. They could had give the role to Kevin Hart and it would had been much funnier and believable. Well if anything Lundgren's partner remind me of him and have the same french voice actor too, and he serve the comic relief role somewhat. So in the end, this movie may make you ask why they made it in the first place, but then the real question should be why not? The first one was never \"that good\" to begin with, and it wasn't that terrible. This a family movie, one that you should watch with your kids and have a fun Saturday night. I saw Dolph do better, i saw him do much worst, but in the end the movie is serving its purpose and as i said my most biggest gripe is the age factor when it comes to Dolph, who act like and is surrounded by people half his age and just do like he is 35.",
         "Within the 20 minutes of viewing this movie both I and my companion agreed that this is most definitely not a kiddy movie, unlike the first one. We'd never let a child under 13 view it (cussing, sexuality, et al). Strangely, things started more adult and ended up on a total G audience note. Usually it's the opposite. This is no big Hollywood production, it's B class, but it undeniably fun to watch. Dolph isn't Schwarzenegger, but he delivers the same sort of cluelessness. Much of the same old plot was pulled from the original Kindergarten Cop, but there were more spins, a different lead, and very different kids, VERY! These are kind of kids whose parents pay $50k-year so that they can have \"advantaged\" children. The type of offspring who'll have a weakly convincing panic attack if someone even mentions 'Gluten' or uses regular plastic. I found this gross and unreal. If children like this actually exist... I quit life. If you haven't seen the first one, absolutely skip this. You're better off trying to suffocate yourself using a hairdryer. If you've seen the first however, and enjoyed it, then you'll probably be amused but not enthused at this extremely late follow-up.",
         "A sequel to the 1990 comedy film Kindergarten Cop starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, 'Kindergarten Cop 2' is a surprising sequel by all means. I mean, its been over 26 years since the first one released. A sequel, that too without Arnie being there, is risk. But this is a direct-to-DVD film & to its luck, Dolph Lundgren is a fine new hero. He shines in the Cute Sequel! 'Kindergarten Cop 2' Synopsis: Assigned to recover sensitive stolen data, a gruff FBI agent goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher, but the school's liberal, politically correct environment is more than he bargained for. 'Kindergarten Cop 2' is simple film, that doesn't aim for any form of greatness. And hence, the narrative works. No, some of the jokes are silly & even some of the sub-plots, aren't sharp. But its Dolph's performance that makes most of it work. He's game here & gleefully plays the big-guy with a soft heart. If not for him, maybe this sequel would've fallen flat on its face. Final Word? 'Kindergarten Cop 2' is fair watch.",
         "When i first read the plot for this movie i was disappointed i mean it sounded more like Taken meets Kindergarten Cop instead of a sequel to a Classic 90's film. But i was wrong this movie wasn't that awful as i thought it was going to be i had low expectations and i enjoyed it for what it was a pointless straight to DVD movie. Now let's talk about the cast the best thing about this movie without a doubt is Dolph Lundgren he was funny, awesome and he loved junk food/sugar for some reason a lot. I liked his partner and the beautiful teacher that she had a crush on and Hal was pretty funny but the worst thing about it was the villain he never seemed like a real threat, also the movie has scenes that just don't fit in like the scene where they dancing i thought it was Footloose for a second there and they also took a lot of things from the original like scenes or lines and that didn't seem right to me especially when the kids don't have the charisma or the charm of the kids from the first film there's even a kid that has an abusive parent that never gets full grown more i mean i get it it's not a big film but give me something to like or get emotional like the first film also why did the police chief put his gum behind his ear and then back to his mouth? i don't know. There's also some good laughs like the scene where Lundgren smashed the head of a dude with the snack machine. Kindergarten Cop 2 is nowhere near as good as the original not by a long shot but the charisma of Dolph Lundgren aka Reed is what totally won me over for the most part. So i give KC 2 a 7 out of 10 a fun but unnecessary sequel. Schwarzenegger is still the Man!!!",
         "'KINDERGARTEN COP 2': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A sequel to the 1990 hit action-comedy flick 'KINDERGARTEN COP' (starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, and directed by Ivan Reitman). This followup is more of a remake, than a sequel, and it stars Dolph Lundgren, as a new character (an FBI agent named Agent Reed). The film was directed by Don Michael Paul (who also helmed such other B- movies as 'HALF PAST DEAD', 'LAKE PLACID: THE FINAL CHAPTER', 'JARHEAD 2: FIELD OF FIRE' and 'TREMORS 5: BLOODLINES') and it was written by David H. Steinberg (who also wrote other B-comedy flicks, like 'SLACKERS' and 'AMERICAN PIE PRESENTS BOOK OF LOVE'). The movie costars Bill Bellamy, Darla Taylor, Fiona Vroom and Aleks Paunovic. The film is severely disappointing, if you're a fan of the original (or good movies in general). Agent Reed (Lundgren) is a very conservative, and dedicated (but slightly crazy), FBI agent. Agent Sanders (Bellamy) is his more rational, and by the book, partner. The two must infiltrate a kindergarten class, on a new assignment, in order to find an important flash drive. Due to the fact that the students there already know who Sanders is, from previously being interviewed by him, Reed must pose as a kindergarten teacher. The modern, and very politically correct, school environment presents a huge challenge for Reed (and his old school ways). The film is adequately directed (for what it is), and decently acted, but it's not funny. The jokes are painful to watch at times, and the whole movie just seems pointless. Maybe the original film would feel the same way, if I actually went back and watched it again, but I did love it when I was a kid. Lundgren is at least likable in the lead; although not nearly as much so, as Schwarzenegger was. Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_3w7EWxV5vg",
         "It's weird that they got Dolph Lundgren to replace  Arnold Schwarzenegger,  considering the movies Schwarzenegger have been doing lately, I see no reason he could not come back and do this sequel. But I guess it should not weird me out too much. It's like Hard target 2, a great movie starting Scott Adkins who replace Jean Claude Van Damme.  Why? I mean Van Damme is still making movies he could have come back. Although, the plot for Hard Target 2 is a little different from the original. Same situation here. This movie happens in Seattle, Washington vs. Portland, Oregon where the other movie happens. Lundgren is a FBI agent not a cop.  Schwarzenegger went undercover to find the bastard son of a criminal he is hunting. Lundgren is looking for a flash drive hidden in a kindergarten school. One big update is Lundgren not only is a tough as nails law enforcer who has to deal with being worse than the criminals he has to do it in the millennial age, where parents are spending 50,000 dollars a year to turn their kids into hipsters.   It's old school tactics on new age theories and new age is going to win simply because they are children. Lundgren does not stand a chance cause he can't blow these kids away like he does all his other enemies. Lundgren is not as entertaining as a Kindergarten Cop as  Schwarzenegger.    Don't want to put the entire blame on Lundgren's massive shoulders.  This movie is two by the numbers in their attempts to hit the marks on all the stereotypes of kids of the 21st century and how out of touch Lundgren is with the times ( As if just the fact that they are children is not enough).   It had a lot of good bits that could have been more funny and thoughtful but all of them went by too fast to really mean anything. Plus they should have used Bill Bellamy a little more, after all, he's on the poster too. http://cinemagardens.com",
         "Before I get started with this movie, I feel I should mention that I was not a fan of the original \"Kindergarten Cop\" movie. I thought that its premise and execution were very contrived, and that its violent climax jarred badly with the rest of the movie. So you may be wondering why I watched this direct-to-DVD sequel. Well, the main reason was that it had Dolph Lundgren in it, an actor whose past movies have given me a lot of enjoyment. However, with this movie, Lundgren badly strikes out. Lundgren is a fine action actor who can play good guys and bad guys, and even has a knack for light comedy. However, this movie proves that extremely goofy comedy is not his forte. He seems very uncomfortable in this comic surrounding, and as a result he isn't very funny at all. (And quite frankly, he often looks quite ghastly, looking at least ten years older than his actual age.) In fairness to Lundgren, it would be hard for even the best comic actors to wring out laughs from this script. The comedy is both lame and obvious. And it's odd that while the premise of the movie is of a law enforcement officer stuck with kids, there is somewhat less of this material than you might expect. The movie often seems preoccupied with other plot material, so much that the central plot of the movie often progresses very slowly or not at all. The one good thing to come out of this weak movie is that with acting in this movie and also taking on the role of executive producer, Lundgren probably made enough money to make his alimony payments for quite some time.",
         "3 Reasons why this is so much better than the original: 1. Dolph is about 60 years old, and so its understandable that the 20 something attractive teacher in the school swoons over him. 2. Dolph Lundgren has more on-screen charisma than Arnold Schwarzenegger 3. Dolph is super tall and has this really nice hunched shoulder like Jaws from the James Bond movies as he walks around the school. Maybe this adds to the on screen charm. Oh wait ... On a serious note. It's an OK time waster movie for the kids on a rainy day, but Kindergarten Cop the original has more to offer.",
         "It took some time before I started to feel affection for Kindergarten Cop. I still don't enjoy it for the cutesy stuff. The kids aren't especially charming or anything. But I actually like Arnold's performance. It's hard to articulate exactly where Kindergarten Cop 2 fails, because it seems to be filled with bad choices. I can't fault anyone in particular for their acting though, since I don't think anyone had any material worth working with. First, there are structural problems. There's a remarkable amount of time spent on plot, even though none of it seems to be important. Normally I'm a big fan of plot over character development, but in this case, the approach robs the story of any sense of humanity. I didn't feel like Dolph's character had much of an arc. Second, an effort to update the movie to make it relevant to \"modern times\" involves turning the school into an expensive private school. A variety of complaints about \"liberal\" teaching methods are leveled, although the movie is also willing to suggest that at least some of these methods are effective. On the other hand, this approach is undermined by including strange things like a therapy pig. This approach to the story will make it seem dated very quickly, and instead just serves to alienate a potential audience. Third, the police-work plot feels like a leftover from the late 80s. Dolph Lundgren is paired with a comic-relief partner. There's a ridiculous shootout in a police station that seems strangely understaffed. There's an angry black captain, who shouts unintelligibly. The music reinforces this. Fourth, the budget's restrictions shine through. I'm easily impressed by movies doing an effective job of working around a tight budget. In this movie, the longer it goes on, it cultivates this strange feeling... like something is missing. There aren't enough people. Not just speaking roles, but there just aren't enough people filling in the empty hallways in the police station and the school. Fifth, there is some strange humor that seems out of place. There's a bit that involves a supporting character being hit in the crotch with a taser. This isn't a fleeting, brief thing. They spend some time dwelling on it. The scene ends with a joke about the guy having soiled himself. This isn't funny. Well, it's funny because it seems like a scene from a dramatically different movie. But what made them think this gag was a good fit for this movie? Sixth, one of the things that I'm sure everyone noticed. Dolph Lundgren is currently 59 years old. His love interest in this movie is played by a girl who is currently 30. This girl talks about Dolph's muscles lovingly. There's something uncomfortable about this romance. I think it could work, but no one mentions Dolph's age. If she acknowledged it, it might seem a little more normal. But as it is, the movie completely ignores that Dolph being drastically older than most of the other characters. Since this is up on Netflix, it's probably worth watching, at least for the curious. This doesn't reach the same levels as The Room, where it's baffling in so many ways. I understand why this was made, but I feel like it was made by people who didn't understand the charm of the original."
