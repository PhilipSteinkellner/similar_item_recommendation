         "The first thing to ask yourself when thinking about watching a movie titled Gingerdead Man Vs. Evil Bong is this: Are you able to switch off your brain and embrace some mildly entertaining, low budget lunacy from the good folks at Full Moon? The titular characters from the Gingerdead Man and Evil Bong series meet in a movie which should, at the very least, satisfy fans of either franchise. The film might service the Evil Bong series slightly more, but there's enough foul mouthed dough-boy Gingerdead man to go around. Larnell is the only one of the stoner quad to return along with Rabbitt, the friend/foil of the series. Larnell and his height-challenged head-shop employee String find themselves in the path of destruction when Gingerdead man decides to take out Sarah Leigh (from the original Gingerdead Man) once and for all! It ain't high art, folk. But if you're in the market for something light and stupid from Full Moon, have at 'er. And at least it isn't as awful as Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys.",
         "Sure, it's barely March the first, but dear God was this terrible. I mean, just WOW! First of all, you get these annoying flashbacks from both movies, like a complete slap in the face to all the fans out there, and then they try the shortest, most idiotic crossover I've ever laid eyes on. I rated it 2! Long time since I've done it, but it was all a complete amateur waste of time, money and some actors. Horrible, dreadful, it is just so hard to fully explain it to you. Maybe, just maybe, if you are like HUGE die-hard fan of both series, and still I hold my doubts, there aren't enough \"maybes\" in the world, but, maybe you can accept this without crying your eyes out. Sad case where words can't begin to describe this mess. Stay away. Pretend it does not exist. Don't poke it, don't look at it, don't even say its name. Go elsewhere. Watch Freddy vs Jason!",
         "I couldn't wait to see this after watching all the Evil Bong movies and two of the Gingerdead Man movies! Myself, I quite liked the Gingerdead man movies I watched, however, Evil Bong wasn't that great. Anyway, because I had watched the other films, I really wanted to see this movie. I was going with gingerdead man to win, and I couldn't wait to see the movie. So, I watched it, and the first thing I saw was Mr Cookie Slasher being fanned by topless women on an island. It was unnecessary but I didn't mind it, as it was funny at the same time and I didn't really mind it. So, it starts off with that, and then it switches to the dick's head shop with a rubbed out s, and there was a person from the first Evil Bong movie flash backing to the previous Evil Bong movies. Myself, I thought that was a good idea to flashback to the previous movies so people that hadn't watched them could get the story. However, it was a bit unnecessarily extended and the flashbacks could of been shorter. So, after another unnecessary long time of pretty much nothing, there is some flashbacks to the gingerdead man movie. That wasn't too long and was the right amount of length, and I quite enjoyed that moment. A few minutes later, someone finds the Evil Bong, and ten minutes later (I think) The Gingerdead Man comes. I was like, \"YES! Finally, they're going to fight!\" Myself, I thought they would fight at the end of the movie, but anyway, it had been an hour, and they were talking to each other. But basically, after that, they don't seem to have a fight at all. Two people are trapped in an evil bong, and that's pretty much it. No big fights between The Gingerdead Man and the Evil Bong. I was awfully disappointed because I wanted to see them have a fight, and they didn't really have one apart from having half a minute of an argument. Myself, I liked this movie, but don't go seeing this if you want to see them fight, because they hardly fight at all. Although, do go see this if your a fan of the Evil Bong franchise. My rating is 5.8/10."
