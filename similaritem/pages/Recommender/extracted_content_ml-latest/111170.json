         "My boyfriend and I saw this film at the Bram Stoker Film Festival. We're both geeks and love low budget horror and we're always looking for something fun to watch. I found it a fun little ride with a good mix of scary and funny moments nothing to deep but a good salute to other horror films. Strong performances from the father played by (Jonathan Hansler) and the daughter (Nicola Posener) and loved the scene with the boyfriend(Brandon Francis). I think it's well worth a watch. Lucy",
         "This film was not bad, it had an okay storyline and some good old fashioned blood spilling. The plot, although not too original, moves along quite good and the characters are actually kind of likable. It is a low budget movie which does well compared to some higher budget films. I did get in to this movie as it kept me interested the whole way through, but it wasn't ground breaking or edge-of-your-seat kind of stuff. As I said, I did like as it was one of the better lower budget films around, but it had moments of lackluster acting which did let it down a bit. They had the right idea for a great movie here but they let it down in the delivery. But overall I give it a 6 out of 10.",
         "Soooo shocking and at the same time with amusing excerpts. Enjoyable nonetheless. With some suspense loaded into it that keeps you gripped for most of the time. The actors carry the plot-line really well even if there is a little overacting in some places. My only niggle was that it left little to the imagination. However I particularly enjoyed the manic look of \"Dad\", who relentlessly pursued his revenge on his family, who he perceived to be individually immoral in their own behaviours or nature. Some familiar themes here of every day life that allow us to all identify with, such as adultery, sexuality and of course murder. The death penalty should definitely be brought back for dad, after his slashing antics.",
         "I recently had great fortune to watch 'Axed' at a local film festival. This psychological thriller was greatly received and I can see why. I am so pleased to have finally seen a film in recent years that I did NOT know the ending to. The genuine twists and turns kept me intrigued throughout the film, the Homage to classical horror films is clear and well done. The relationship between the unhinged father and his children is superbly acted (ignoring some over acting from the lead actor at times), I would highly recommend watching more from this particular cast. It was not the gore fest I was expected, the director, quite rightly, left a lot to your own imagination, which in my experience makes the film much scarier. The DOP should be highly congratulated on their skills in presenting this film so well, despite some shots that felt as though they should have been lightened; the use of natural light was cleverly done. I even found out afterwards that some of this film used C.G.I. and green screen to enhance some shots, which was fabulous, as it was done in such a way that people were completely unaware, which is more than I can say for most low budget horror films being reviewed recently. The only thing I would say is that It almost needed to be longer to build the father's mental break down to make it more intense in the cottage scenes when he finally snaps. Despite some of the sound quality being poor in parts and minimal continuity errors I would highly recommend watching this as a good example of how a good low budget film can be made.",
         "I am literally shocked at how low a rating this film has. Before I go on I want to mention that I actually really enjoyed this as a horror fan who has seen so much low budget crap lately. No film makers seem to know how use a low budget and still make a good solid movie like John Carpenter used to or people of his calibre. The film isn't perfect, some of it is laughable but that's par for the course when it comes to horror. The film is reminiscent of The Shining in some ways as we watch a man lose his mind and torture his own family. The performances in the film were first rate...I was extremely impressed with this small and very effective cast. The setting was brilliant, creepy and isolated and setting the tone. Perhaps the only complaint (but it is a pretty big complaint) is that you really have to suspend belief and ignore some massive plot holes to find it enjoyable. I know that is absolutely the cast with 99.9% (perhaps 100%) of horror films but I just felt like the script could have paved over those plot holes just a little bit better. Following the climax of the film into the last scenes it definitely treads on some cheesy moments but its so much fun and there is enough tension to keep it plugging along. This, in my opinion, was a solid slasher flick with some very different twists. Jonathan Hansler is outstanding as Kurt Wendell who loses his job and literally spirals out of control until he is a sputtering, raving mad lunatic torturing his own family. His emotional spiral is fast but significant and really well done on his part. His wide eyed, creepy maniac is right up there with any great horror performance. Andrea Gordon is decent as his wife. She shows some great chops in the intense scenes during the climax and her chemistry with Hansler and the two actors playing her children is very good. Christopher Rithin is also very good as the meek and bullied son. He perhaps has the biggest range as a character next to Hansler but at the same time he also feeds a couple of the more cheesy moments in the film. He is still very good in his part. Nicola Posener plays the daughter and does so decently well. She is, in some ways, the weakest member of the cast if not just for the reason that her character has the least range from beginning to end. Her and Rithin have really great chemistry as brother and sister at odds and then working together to survive. In all honesty, this might be one of the strongest low budget casts in a horror flick I have ever seen. It appears as though director and writer Ryan Lee Driscoll has a history in documentaries so this would be his first real foray into fictional film making and horror. I think he shows some incredible talent behind the camera and with the script. It isn't often you can find a unique horror film like this let alone one shot on a low budget that is entertaining and fun to watch. The plot holes that kept nagging at me were how long his family takes before actually trying to get away. I mean he is a middle aged, average shape joe and yet they don't even try to run or overpower him even after finding someone bound and gagged and cut up in their attic. He seems to gain on them no matter how badly hurt he is and no matter how fast they run. Its sort of typical horror movie plot holes but it still bothered me to some extent. I think some slight editing to the screenplay could have perhaps filled in some of these oversights. Regardless, if you like low budget horror than I think this one will really surprise you. For what it is and for what it was made for this one is a keeper!! Far from perfect and yet satisfying and well made. 7.5/10",
         "Saw this at this year's Bram Stoker Film Festival where it played to a very receptive audience of horror movie fans and picked up the award for Best Screenplay. Works well as a disturbing psycho-drama based around a man who loses his job and then his mind, much to the increasing horror of his family. A great music score and moody cinematography helps to build the atmosphere. Jonathan Hansler is the true star of the show here, obviously relishing the dark humour of his part as the dejected father with one last project to manage up his sleeve. Well it's certainly one way to downsize!�",
         "this film deals with a subject that make headlines every week sadly.but here it is dealt with darkly black humour.johnathon hansler does a great job as the head of the wendell family. a man who succumbs to the pressures of modern life after losing his job.he takes his family on what they think is an ideal weekend in the country. once there he begins his reign of terror upon his loved ones . the violent scenes could have been a bit more gory which would have added more humour to a grim situation.overall i enjoyed this film and the negative comments don't add up. what do you expect from a film called axed?the director shows real potential and i look forward to more films from him.",
         "This is a low budget that's for sure, you can easily spot it on the way it was filmed and the sound that isn't always that good, especially the dubbed sound. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it even as it never became scary or gory. You just want to know how it is going to end. A very strict father, Kurt Wendell (Jonathan Hansler) can't take it anymore. His wife is having an affair with his boss and he's fired. Not only that, his daughter walks around like a whore and his son looks like a fagot. The day he's fired he goes berserk. But not showing it he takes his family to the countryside for a nice day with dad. From there the horror comes in. The red stuff is available but most of the stabbing or axing is done off-screen. There's a lot of talking going on from dad explaining what he knows about the affair. And a lot of talking with his children. But somehow you want to know who survives and who will die. There's of course a lot of drama in it. The acting did add this flick to a higher level, Jonathan Hansler was believable. But I can understand that some will not like this flick because it's a bit low on the horror. Ideal for a starter. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",
         "This is a small UK horror that is way better than the 3.4 rating it currently has on IMDb. It is a disturbing and creepy film with a wonderfully sinister and maniacal performance by Jonathan Hansler as the deranged father. He is backed up by good performances from the rest of the surprisingly good cast. There is barely a dull moment as Dad goes on the rampage. You never quite know where the story will go and it is refreshing to see a horror film that isn't predictable. There are scenes of real tension throughout and plenty of blood for those that like that kind of thing. I really enjoyed this film and I am really surprised it has such bad reviews. Yes it isn't perfect or ground breaking but for a small film it punches well above it's weight. Recommended if you like slightly quirky UK horror.",
         "I watched this last night and while the actors, cinematography and basic plot of the film was good, the script was totally unbelievable. It had the potential to be a good film, but it wasn't. The basic premise of a man losing his job and then killing his family is quite believable, as it happens in real life unfortunately far to often, but the reaction of the children to what is happening around them is not. They must have realised that their father had gone insane, and was going to kill them all. They had the opportunity to escape, and could have hit their father over the head with something after he had killed their mother, but do not. Also the girl had a hidden phone, and could have called the emergency services, but does not. The kids just carry on obeying their father after he did the most terrible things. Sorry, but this is not how people, especially teenagers, react in such a situation. Eventually they do defend themselves against their father, but it took far too long. Also, the girl pierces her fathers leg with a garden fork, and pins his leg to the ground. She then leaves him and he manages to take the garden fork out of his leg and run after her! And she a teenager and he in his forties, he manages to catch up with her! Completely unbelievable, as the man would have been in agony with probably either a bleeding artery in the leg or fractured leg."
