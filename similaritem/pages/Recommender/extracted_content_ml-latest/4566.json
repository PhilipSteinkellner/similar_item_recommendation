         "American Ninja 2: The Confrontation is the best movie in the whole series and one of the best action movies I have ever seen. It has everything and what's more important: it has NINJAS! Tons of ninjas. In fact, there are so many ninjas in this movie that people got used to them. Ninjas wander around freely, shopping in supermarkets, hiding on roofs, driving cars, taking the sun on secluded beaches. This movie taught me one important lesson: ninjas are one of us and we should respect them. After seeing this great movie I say hello to ninjas on the street and I'm not afraid anymore to look under my bed in case a ninja is hiding there. We shouldn't be afraid of ninjas, ninjas are our friends! But back to the movie. It has three elements that make it so great: it has Michael Dudikoff, an exotic location, and a truck load of ninjas. The plot is simple, Dudikoff (himself being an invincible ninja) kicks some ninja ass then kicks some more and finally destroys the villain's master plan (sell clone-ninjas to other villains). But what makes this movie great is the unbelievable amount of action: ninja fights on a beach, bar fights, car chases, explosions, more explosions, sword fights. And if you think that ninjas perform only two basic functions: spying and killing, you're wrong. Because ninjas in American ninja 2 evolved, now they are also: bodyguards, sentinels, inept killers, car drivers, butlers, guards, human statues, decorations, extras, stunts, martial artists, masters of disguise and masters in ridiculing themselves. But why would a villain hire them instead of a conventional army? Because ninjas look cool and have three main characteristics that common soldiers don't have: they are FAST (the quickness with which their ass gets kicked is just amazing), they are SILENT (maybe they're silent, but that doesn't help them when they wander around in their black suits in broad daylight!) and they are DEADLY (I don't think they managed to kill anyone in the movie let alone even scratching Dudikoff). And the potential buyers are all a brilliant assortment of stereotyped villains: from the street pimp and the drug lord to the south-American dictator and the Arabian prince. And the main base of the villain is even more stereotyped, it has everything a villain dreams of: a representative logo (a lion with a shuriken in his head), a lab (with scientists and all), an arena (where ninjas can perform) and an office (from where the villain can dominate the world). And the most amazing thing is that if you are dressed like a ninja you can easily enter this heavily guarded complex and wander around freely. Ninjas walk the halls, buy coffees, take the elevators, go on cigarette breaks. They are just like us, but dressed like ninjas! Black ones, blue ones, red ones, it doesn't matter. The more the merrier. I learned the lesson and I'm sure you'll all learn it too after seeing this movie: ninjas are one of us. And remember, ninjas are EVERYWHERE!",
         "Crapped out of the minds of the people who brought us: NINJA III: THE DOMINATION, CYBORG COP II, SPIDERS II: BREEDING GROUND, and +sigh+ the amazing BREAKIN' II: ELECTRIC BOOGALOO comes American NINJA III...I mean II. Whatever... Joe Armstrong and Joe Jackson go to some island paradise, which of course in infested with ninjas. Good guys meet bad guys. Bad guys go dead. All is well in the land. But THANK YOU GOLAN/GLOBUS for bringing us this trash...it might surpass DEATH WISH III as the funniest film of all time. It is perhaps one of those rare instances where every single person involved in any way with this film, was doing the most mediocre job possible. Truly some events like this only come along once in a lifetime. The fight choreography in this film is beyond comparison to anything in the modern world. It took three people to write this script, they probably thought it was clever that the first name of the bad guy \"THE LION\", is actually \"LEO\". HMMMMMM FORESHADOWING. Remember this word class....FORE SHA DOW ING. One day I will buy the rights to this movie and re-dub it to my taste. If you play with GI JOES and eat PASTE, this is probably you're favorite movie. If you're a 10 year old boy, you are forgiven. The rest of you FOR SHAME. Steal this movie if you have to...it's worth it. American NINJA II **** stars.comedy.1987",
         "I first saw this movie when i was 13 on the wgn movie of the week. This was the showcase for numerous jean claude movies and Bronson Death wish flix. But this movie stands out on its own. When I first saw it I had never laughed at a movie so much in my life, and immediately I knew I needed to own it. SO i waited around and found out when it was on next and taped it off TV. Then the studying of greatness started. There are numerous Flaws and items of interest that one should look for to help them through this classic. First and foremost is dudikoff ( the American ninja)'s delivery. Everything is said in the same monotone intense voice. For example, He would say the line \"I want to kill you!\" the same way he would say, \"I love you\" or \"The president has been kidnapped.\" And also his giant package that my girlfriend noticed last viewing of the movie which is ridiculous and pertruding. Now for individual scenes; When Dudikoff and James are meeting with Wild Bill for the first time, look at Dudikoff at the end of the scene and you will see that it isn't dudikoff at all but a stunt double. Next the scene on the beach with the first conflict with the ninjas. Not only are the ninjas super bumbling but at the end of the scene James and Dudikoff are shown jumping off a 100 foot cliff, but in the cut away they gingerly land on the back of a speed boat without injury. There are other scenes and memorable items but I must mention one more. 'THE SUPER NINJA' - There is a ninja in the movie that really isn't a character in the movie but a random ninja that is somehow immortal compared to the rest of the ninjas that dudikoff kills with a punch. This ninja flips onto a truck, gets knocked off, pulls out a grappling hook, holds on while being dragged, causes a motorcycle accident, flips back onto the front of the truck, still alive crawls up the front right before the truck that he's on flies into what appears to be a gasoline plant of some sort and into a giant fireball. Kudos. THank you golan globus. I love you.",
         "Don't go into this expecting a Steven Seagal or Van Damme type movie. This was made when the Ninja was big on the small screen. I've seen countless Videos of Ninja movies, but this one, with Ninja III:The Domination, stuck in the mind. Looking back on it, this movie somewhat tacky now but it's about entertainment more than anything. The story is feeble, but you want to see this for the action above anything else. Steve James is about the only one in the film that acts really, I really can't see how he never made top billing around all the cardboard actors on screen. I saw this movie many years ago and thought it was an excellent movie back in my \"Ninja phase\", it's bad in places and fun in others. Don't go into this with a straight face, try and enjoy it as a fun \"straight to video\" movie.",
         "Even better than the original. This one provides some true fun as Dudikoff and James go undercover to Probe the mystery why marines are being kidnapped turns out it involves ninjas (Like you didn't know that!) American Ninja II is a best bet for a late night action movie festival. Dudikoff and James last movie together (before Steve James sadly died in 1996) . American Ninja II is a must see for fans of the genre thanks to some humor and excellent action scenes. Steve James really steals the show as the sidekick who can handle dialog as well as action scenes. The film feels low rent but you can do a lot worse when it comes to this genre. American Ninja II is a likable action romp that rises above it's low budget and entertains.",
         "The 2nd in the series FAR exceeds the first and most likely is the best in the series. If you buy the dvd of the 2nd film the 3rd comes on it, in the 3rd there is no michael dudioff, and I'm not sure even if jackson is in the 3rd. I just had to put my two cents in and say THIS IS BETTER THAN THE FIRST...and does not deserve close to the score it has here..I am giving this 10/10.",
         "Here's another great martial arts action film. Prior to the first AN, American Ninja 2, provide lots of action and suspense just like the first one. This time taking on \"superninjas\" they weren't so super to me there. Both Armstrong and Jackson(Michael Dudikoff and Steve James) were always on top of things. The Marines weren't so warm to the Army Rangers at first, but when it was getting the job done Armstrong and Jackson don't play around. Armstrong was all techniques, Jackson was all power, that's why he is later named \"Powerhouse\" Jackson. He was the martial artist with attitude. Especially when he stomped on the ninja and he said, \"STAY DOWN!\" You don't play with Powerhouse Jackson. The outside fight scene with Joe and the ninjas were memorable as well. I liked the part where Joe catches the dart with his hand and took out that ninja with the shuriken(throwing star). These characters were outrageous, they'll make any brawler run home to mama. This movie is just as good as first, however it does have more action though, which I like the best. Rating 3.5 out of 5 stars.",
         "Steve James originally didn't want to appear in this first sequel, since it was to be shot in South Africa (which was still under apartheid). He later admitted that he had a lot of fun making the movie, which is evident onscreen. Like the first movie, James steals the show from Dudikoff, both in his martial arts skills and with a bouncy performance that makes him a treat to watch. The best that can be said about Dudikoff's performance is that he seems to be a lot more comfortable in front of the camera than he was the first time around. He's still very unemotional, has almost no dialogue, and it's still clear he knows little to nothing about martial arts, seeing how he does pretty simple moves (when not being doubled.) Despite the movie being weighed down by Dudikoff's presence, it's still a fun movie, certainly better than the first movie. The locations are eye-catching, giving the movie a nice backdrop. The pace is quicker, giving us little chance to be bored between the action sequences. And there's certainly plenty of action, with dozens of ninjas popping up everywhere at any time. Yes, there is a cheesiness to the entire enterprise, from George Clinton's synthesizer score to the ludicrous scheme of the villain... but hey, it's a *fun* kind of cheese, one that makes you smile instead of grit your teeth. Sometimes a little silliness is what the doctor ordered, and it's also a nostalgic blast for those into '80s actioners.",
         "When watching American Ninja 2 we must keep in mind this is a movie made in 1987 and most of all that it is\u0085well a ninja movie. There was a huge boom in this kind of flicks at the time and its elements were well defined. A lot of bad ninjas, a hero, cool action scenes and some of the worst dialog to ever appear on film. However I must admit that I was and in a way still am a big fan of the genre. Lets face it, these movies were fun. American Ninja 2 is one of the best examples. Part of a series of five films this is without a doubt the highlight of the saga. Michael Dudikoff had the looks to be the star. But unfortunately not the talent. Thus the small dialog he has. He still does an OK job as the hero and doesn't disappoint in the fight scenes but in total Steve James steals the movie with his charisma and style. This guy was great. He was having fun and made us enjoy it as much as he did. He also had some acting skills, which helped a lot since everybody else were close to amateurs. Steve James was the man! I also have to mention Jeff Weston who was very funny as Wild Bill. Good job. The story is weak but still its not embarrassingly bad. Anyway what matters is the action and while some fights didn't work very well, there were a lot of scenes so we still get loads of punching, kicking and swordplay. The music also helps. Its very 80´s of course and sets the atmosphere and the rhythm for the action very successfully. We also have some nice locations, a lot of beach and sun and even some pretty girls sunbathing. Of course the movie is cheesy but if you try not to notice all its flaws and just enjoy it for what it is you'll have a lot of fun. There's lots of action, some really bad dialog that will make you laugh really hard and of course in the end everybody´s happy. An entertaining movie even today and one of the best ninja flicks ever. RIP Steve James I still remember you!",
         "Yeah if your a true movie fan and like only fine cinema it does suck but if you love bad action movies for the sheer comedic value this is it. This is by far the best AN movie in this god awful series. You get some classic one liners out of Steve James (who is the real star of this movie), The Dude (Mikael Dudikoff) kicking people half way across the screen. What makes this movie is the bar room scene nearing the end of the film, this is where James shines he combines a bad-a$$ fighting technique and great one liners at the same time. Granted he was fighting petty thugs but its a gem. If your planning a bad movie night i do suggest getting this."
