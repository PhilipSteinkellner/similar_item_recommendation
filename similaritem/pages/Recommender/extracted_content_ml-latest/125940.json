         "I've just seen Ryan Larkin's \"Syrinx\" along with other two creations of this brilliant animator, \"Street Musique\" and \"Walking\" during the Buenos Aires Festival of Independent Cinema and I must say that this one wasn't as good as the other two, but anyway, the incredible combination between drawings and classical music let you spend 3 minutes of relax and visual amusement. I've felt it pretty much more because previously it was projected the Oscar winner \"Ryan\", which pays homage to Ryan Larkin, and \"Alter Egos\", which is the making of Ryan and a biography of him. In conclusion, it's a must see for all the animation adepts, not only this one, but clearly every single Larkin creation.",
         "In memory of the recent death of Ryan Larkin, Cartoon Brew displayed Syrinx and a short about him in its blog. This short seems to display animated chalk drawings against a black background of a naked woman with a funny-looking man following her and embracing her all around the forest before she disappears in thin air leaving the man eating grass in the end. Classical flute music by Claude Debussy is played throughout. What fascinating images by the creative but troubled Larkin. His output was brief but very influential. I hope more of his work is made available on DVD so I and many others who love animation will see what a unique talent he really was."
