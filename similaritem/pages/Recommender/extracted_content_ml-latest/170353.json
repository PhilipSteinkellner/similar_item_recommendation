The two lead performances are fantastic and the chemistry between them makes you care what happens right from the start, and the script keeps their characters developing both plausibly and unpredictably. This film is laugh-out-loud funny, surprising and surreal, sad and moving in parts...yet always true. It looks beautiful, holds your attention all the way through and sends you away happier than when you went in. \"In A World\" of clich√©s, and film franchises, Everyone's Going To Die' is the best film I've seen in a very long time."],
