      "synopsis": "In Madrid, driving down an isolated road after a secret tryst, María José (Lucia Bosè), and her lover Juan (Alberto Closas) hit a cyclist and kill him. Instead of staying and calling the police for help the two run away as their relationship is a clandestine one and Maria's powerful husband Miguel Castro (Otello Toso) is partly responsible for Juan's position as a college professor. Maria and Juan were high school sweethearts and Maria married up in class when she took Miguel as her husband so when social wannabe and hanger on Rafael \"Rafa\" Sandoval (Carlos Casaravilla) teases Maria and Juan about secrets they keep. The two lovers start to think that Rafa may know something and they confront him. As it turns out Miguel reads the suspicious nature of his wife and her lover correctly and plans to take Maria away out of the country. Juan is a mathematics teacher at the local college and consumed by guilt when he causes an altercation and student revolt due to his distracted treatment of a student. Juan has a change of heart and decides to confess to the police and asks Maria to come with him, but the woman understands all too clearly her place and what she has to lose, and she confronts her conscience in an extreme way. ---------------------- written by KrystelClaire Una carretera con tres árboles resecos a los lados. Un hombre mayor (Manuel Alexander), vestido con abrigo y pantalones, va en bicicleta, él sólo. Se le pierde de vista detrás de una curva. Inmediatamente aparece un coche en dirección contraria que frena bruscamente. Es una pareja. El hombre se baja a atender al ciclista herido. Una rueda de la bicicleta gira y gira. El hombre dice \"Aún está vivo\", pero la mujer, vestida con un largo abrigo de pieles, lo llama \"Juan, Juan\". Juan Fernández Soler (Alberto Closas) se da cuenta. La pareja se sube al coche y se va, dejando al ciclista tirado. María José de Castro (Lucía Bosé, doblada al castellano con la voz de Elsa Fábregas) es quien conduce, y Juan no puede evitar mirar para atrás continuamente. Ninguno de los dos dice nada hasta llegar a Madrid. Está lloviendo. María se abraza a Juan y afirma tener miedo. Juan la calma, se baja del coche y promete llamarla. María se va conduciendo, mientras Juan se reafirma que nadie los ha visto. Juan mira a ninguna parte mientras se fuma un cigarrillo. Un hombre y una mujer besándose en la boca. Son Miguel Castro (Otello Toso) y María José dando una fiesta en casa a unos amigos. Una de esas amigas, Cristina (Mercedes Albert) comenta que no hay otra razón para que Miguel haya comprado un brazalete tan caro a María José aparte de que los negocios le van muy bien. Mientras esperan por Carmina (Alicia Romay) y Jorge (Emilio Alonso) para cenar, María José le pregunta al pianista cómo se llama la pieza que está tocando. El pianista responde que Chantaje , a las 5:30 de la tarde en la carretera a Francia. La sonrisa se va de la cara de ella. El pianista pregunta si María José tiene algo que declarar: drogas, dinero, amantes..., a lo que ella responde que no. Rafael \"Rafa\" Sandoval (Carlos Casaravilla) es el pianista. Esa noche, están esperando para cenar a Juan. Doña María (Julia Delgado Caro) le pregunta si algo le preocupa, a lo que Juan contesta que cree que no le darán la cátedra, porque tendría que trabajar demasiado. Doña María le dice que encontes tiene que trabajar más. Juan dice que Carmina es la buena hija de doña María, que se ha casado bien. Carmina y Jorge se quedan a cenar en la fiesta con María José, así que llaman a doña María. Doña María dice a Juan que él podría ir a la fiesta. Carmina se queja en la fiesta diciendo que Juan es un desastre, que nunca quiere hacer nada, lo que es una pena, porque si trabajase más Jorge podría ayudarle a llegar muy lejos. El gracioso de la fiesta suelta un discurso que nadie se toma en serio, pero que después aparece como una noticia en el NODO. Juan en el cine ve ese discurso durante la cena, con todos los comensales ya sentados. No le gusta la noticia y se sale del cine, a fumar. María José le pide a Miguel que la lleve con él a su viaje de negocios. Éste no se opone, pero es al final María José la que da marcha atrás. En su solitaria cama, Juan recuerda lo que María José le dijo una vez, que estaba harta de ver siempre las mismas caras y que quería irse. Al día siguiente, en su trabajo como profesor adjunto, el catedrático de matemáticas tiene que salir un momento durante el examen. Juan no presta atención a la alumna que está resolviendo un problema. Al contrario, hace ruido con el periódico. Aquí es cuando lee una noticia titulada Muerte de un ciclista. Eso lo pone aún más nervioso, mientras la alumna sigue dando las explicaciones. Juan no puede evitar soltar \"¡Cállese!\". La alumna para, confundida, y parece a punto de echarse a llorar. En el hipódromo, en los entrenamientos, Miguel y sus amigos aplauden las evoluciones del caballo Emperador. Como si mantuvieran una conversación trivial, Juan le dice a María José que el ciclista murió, y que ahora sólo les queda esperar. El amigo plasta les lee los titulares de la sección de sucesos. La del ciclista y la de Piluca, a quien le han robado una joya, son las más destacadas. Corte al circo, con los niños riéndose del payaso que llora. María José se está poniendo nerviosa con las indirectas del amigo plasta. Juan le dice que pudo verla conduciendo a ella sóla, pero que seguro que no la ha relacionado con el atropello. María José insiste en que tienen que intentar averiguar qué es lo que sabe Rafa y la policía. Juan teme que esa investigación ponga en la pista a los demás sobre su relación. La pareja no se atreve a besarse en público, delante de los niños. Matilde Luque Carvajal (Bruna Corrà) va a protestar a Juan. Ella sabe que no se merece ese suspenso, y que la suspendió Juan, no el catedrático. Juan le dice que recurra al claustro. Matilde sabe que sería inútil, porque el yerno de Juan lo protejería frente a cualquier reclamación. A Juan le sienta mal que le digan que es un protegido. Juan reconoce que fue un error y que la nota es injusta, pero de todas formas no parece que vaya a hacer nada para solucionar el error. En una galería de arte. María José y Rafa están criticando unos cuadros, pero él se da cuenta de que no es de eso de lo que ella quiere hablar. Rafa dice que él da un baño de cultura a las reuniones de sociedad a las que asiste, pero que por sí solo no podría mantenerse viviendo tan bien, y que se dedica a observar lo que hace toda la gente de la \"buena sociedad\". Él le pide dinero, y ella acepta; además, Rafa está interesado en acostarse con María José. Miguel, Rafa y María José asisten a una boda en una capilla al aire libre. Rafa revolotea alrededor de Miguel y María José. Rafa le pregunta a Miguel si es verdad que se van a ir él y María José de viaje. María José atiende distraidamente a una amiga que le habla de un partido de canasta a favor de los \"niños pobres, o de los niños tontos, o de los niños algo\". Juan visita a Aurelia Gómez Tejedor en un barrio popular, abarrotado, populoso, con los críos correteando por las escaleras y todas partes. Una vecina (Matilde Muñoz Sampedro), mayor, despeinada, desastrada, con un bebé en brazos, le dice que Aurelia está en Madrid por lo del seguro. Juan se hace pasar por periodista, y le pregunta por la viuda. La vecina le hace entrar en su piso. Le dice que Aurelia tiene máquina de coser. La vecina afirma que la policía no tiene ninguna pista sobre el coche. De hecho, el bebé que la vecina cuida es el de Aurelia, y hay otro crío Toño, por allí. María José pregunta a Miguel por su conversación con Rafa, quien de repente le cae mal. Miguel le dice que Rafa critica a todo y a todos porque es su trabajo. A Rafa no le gusta que María José viaje. Juan llama a María José para decirle que nadie sabe nada, pero ella cree que Rafa sí. El sargento de la policía de tráfico (Fernando Sancho) comenta el caso con Encarna (Elisa Méndez), la tabernera de la tasca La Serrana, donde también se sirven comidas. Dicen que tuvo que ser un camión, y que el hombre podría haberse salvado si no lo hubieran dejado allí tirado. Mientras tanto, la patrona de una pensión intenta ver a la amante de María José. Juan comenta que la guerra lo dejó vacío y que ya no cree en nada, ni siquiera en la novia que no lo esperó porque se casó con un hombre rico. María José dice que todavía ama a Juan, su amor de los 18 años. Juan reconoce que a veces desea que todo salte por los aires y se descubra. Miguel y María José van a cenar con unos americanos que les podrían dar una contrata. Jorge presionará y les ayudará, como de costumbre. Miguel sospecha que Juan está muy enamorado de ella, y que otra gente envidia a María José, sus apellidos, su dinero. Le pregunta por su antiguo novio. Le cuenta la historia de un matrimonio que Rafa le había contrado a él: un matrimonio donde ella le fue infiel a él, él le quitó todo el dinero a ella y que nadie después se dignaba a hablar con ella, que perdió toda su posición social. Rafa toca el piano y entretiene a los americanos. Carmina quiere que Juan escriba una novela o algo así. María José dice a Juan que Miguel y Rafa siguen lanzándole indirectas. Juan le dice a María José que tiene que sonreír más. Rafa dice a Miguel que está en medio de un negocio con María José y Juan, pero no dice nada más. Llevan a los americanos a un tablao flamenco. La cantaora es Gracita Montes. Rafa se emborracha y dice que él sabe las cosas sucias de la gente bien. Juan acaba pegándole, y Rafa dice que es a partir de entonces cuando él va a empezar a divertirse. Hay un montón de miradas entre Juan, Miguel, Rafa - susurrándole algo a María José -. Rafa habla con Miguel y el camarero avisa a Juan de que le está esperando la policía. Juan ataca a Rafa, y este coje una botella rota para defenderse. Miguel para la pelea. Miguel le vuelve a preguntar a Rafa si realmente ha visto lo que dice que ha visto, con María José delante. Rafa afirma que vio a María José con Juan en su coche. Ella le pregunta \"qué más, qué más\", varias veces, y se echa llorando en brazos de Miguel. Rafa no entiende nada, y Miguel parece no creer a Rafa. La botella que tira Rafa, algo menos borracho, enlaza con la que tiran los estudiantes rompiendo un cristal de una ventana del decanato de la universidad. El decano (José Prada) está interrogando a Juan, mientras que los estudiantes se manifiestan en su contra. La razón es la injusticia en la nota con Matilde. El decano aconseja a Juan hablar con su cuñado para que lo apoye. Matilde lamenta todo el jaleo que se ha montado con su nota. Juan dice que algunos de ellos están ahí para montar jaleo, pero que otros sí que realmente están preocupados por la situación de Matilde. Juan dice que el hecho de que tuviese que ir a buscarlo la policía - el decano no lograba dar con él - lo había asustado muchísimo. Juan afirma que la manifestación le ha hecho sentirse joven de nuevo. Matilde se va sin rencor, y ella misma calma a muchos de sus compañeros. Hay un funeral con mucho boato. María José, para calmarlo, le dice que Rafa al final no sabía nada de lo suyo, y que Miguel no lo creyó de todas formas. María ya ni se acuerda del \"accidente\", mientras que Juan no deja de pensar en ello. María José le da un donativo para que Juan lo haya llegar a Aurelia de manera anónima. Juan quiere hablar con ella con más calma, y María José dice que lo harán, pero más adelante, ya que en ese momento necesitan ser prudentes. Juan se mueve por la iglesia como alma en pena, y un cura le pregunta si quiere confesarse, pero Juan responde que no, que ya es demasiado tarde. Las pistas de atletismo de la universidad. El entrenador (Antonio Casas) habla con Juan de los viejos tiempos en que corrían delante de las boyonetas. Juan dice que va a arreglar todo. El entrenador dice que puede volver a hablar con él en cualquier momento, y él manda besos para Magda y las niñas. Matilde aparece al otro lado de una vaya. Juan le da una nota dimitiendo, y le pide que se la lleve al decano o a secretaría. Matilde le dice que se lo piense mejor. Juan dice que se va por una larga temporada y que cuando él vuelva, igual ella ya no es estudiante, está casada y tiene críos. Juan le da las gracias por todo. Matilde se preocupa por él. Juan dice que tiene que irse por algo malo que hizo una vez. Juan llama a María José, que está ya poniendo sábanas sobre los muebles. Se van al extranjero ese mismo día. Juan dice a María José que se entregue con él. María José le dice que sí, aunque parece estar replanteándose todo. Cuando Miguel baja por las escaleras, ve que algo va bien. Doña María le dice a Juan que nunca lo ha entendido, y que no ha sido capaz de ayudarlo. Miguel se da cuenta de que María José sólo quiere de él su dinero. Miguel le dice que es ella la que tendrá que elegir: él se va a ir en avión a las 9:15 al extranjero por mucho tiempo, y es decisión de María José decidir si se va con él o no. Más tarde, Juan le dice a ella que en cuando se delaten, serán libres por fin. María José no quiere eso. Juan dice que, en ese momento, si ella no se entrega con él, él no podrá evitar delatarla y arrastrarla con él. Al mismo tiempo, Matilde la da la carta de dimisión a doña María, no al decano. Doña María piensa que Juan es incapaz de hacer algo malo. Juan vuelve al lugar donde estaban las trincheras durante la guerra. Él se pone a recordar esos años de la guerra, cuando él se consolaba pensando en María José. La tierra está baldía. En ese mismo sitio, fue donde atropellaron al ciclista. María José tiene frío - el día está despejado pero desangelado - y se mete en el coche. Ella se retuerce el pelo, desesperada, y mira el reloj, con prisa. Juan parece dispuesto a irse, pero hace una seña a María José para que se acerque. María José se aferra al volante con rabia. Cuando él vuelve a insistir, ella arranca y acelera. Se baja para mirar si ha matado a Juan definitivamente. Miguel sigue esperando en al casa, ahora cubierta de sábanas por todas partes. Ve un retrato de mesa de María José y lo rompe contra el suelo. María José conduce como una loca para llegar a tiempo junto a Miguel. Es de noche, es muy tarde, pisa a fondo. De repente, ve a otro ciclista (Manuel Alexander). Para evitar otro atropello, María José pega un volantazo y ella y el coche se caen por un puente abajo. El cadáver de María José se queda como colgado cabeza abajo. El ciclista tiene la luz de la lámpara rota, y sólo se enciende a ratos. El ciclista mira la bombillita apesumbrado, y luego no puede evitar mirar el cadáver de María José, con los ojos abiertos como platos. El ciclista sale huyendo de la escena del accidente.",

         "Juan Antonio Bardem's \"Muerte de un ciclista\" was discovered in a Cannes Film festival where it received the International Critics' Award, where it was shown out of competition. Spain was living the years after the Civil War under the Franco regime. The Catholic church dominated everything in the country. It was indeed a miracle the film even was screened! The film aroused curiosity because of the way it was received outside the country. The censure deemed it a \"gravely dangerous\" film, thus limiting a possible audience. Mr. Bardem was part of a Communist minority that didn't leave the country after Franco came into power. He, and several other film makers decided to stay and make films in which a lot of symbolism was insinuated in the stories they presented. The director despised the Spanish bourgeoisie, who supported Franco in order to justify their excesses. This film came out of an impoverished Spain in which one notices the contrasts between the classes immediately. Maria Jose, the beautiful society matron, and Juan, a man from a good family, but who hasn't amount to anything, were having an affair. As the story opens, we watch the car where they are traveling during a rainy and overcast day on a lonely stretch of a country road. Maria Jose, who is driving her car, accidentally hits the cyclist. Juan gets out of the car to see the condition of the cyclist. Noticing he is in bad shape, he tells Maria Jose, who is horrified. She prefers to leave the man on the road to fend for himself as they flee the scene of the crime. The accident is a catalyst in their illicit relationship. Maria Jose cares more about her good name and her status in society and what it will do to her and her husband. Juan, on the other hand, struggles with his own conscience. To make matters worse, Juan, a university professor makes the mistake of shutting up one of his female students who is working a math problem. Maria Jose's life takes a turn when Rafa, a critic that moves in her circle, insinuates he knows about her affair, without coming out in the open. Their guilt play tricks on the lovers. Their love suddenly is challenged by Rafa, who is a dangerous man. Rafa will stop at nothing in his desire for Maria Jose as it appears he will try to black mail her at all costs. Jose, who can't live with his conscience anymore decides to turn himself in. Maria Jose will not let him; she will do anything to stop him, even hitting him deliberately with her own car. Maria Jose, in her frenzied state, almost hits another cyclist, in avoiding hitting the man, she ends up going off the bridge. Mr. Bardem, who contributed to the screen play of the film with Luis Fernando de Igoa, wanted to show the hypocrisy of the upper classes in their collaboration with Franco. He also pointed out to the nepotism that was rampant during those years the way that Juan gains a position thanks to his influential brother. Matilde, the young female student, and her class mates at the university, point out to the new type of citizen that would question the system under Franco. The sublime Lucia Bose, one of the most beautiful faces in the Italian cinema of the years after WWII, is one of the best things in the film. She is equally matched by Alberto Closas, who gives his Juan the right tone for his character. Carlos Casaravilla, makes a wonderful villain, Rafa, the man who is a parasite and envies the moneyed types that tolerate him and use him. Bruna Corra, who is seen as Matilde, has some good opportunities. The black and white cinematography by Alfredo Fraile shows us the Spain of the 1950s that evokes some of the best Italian masters of the era. Isidro Maiztegui's musical score works well with the film. Ultimately this film stands together with another Juan Antonio Bardem's masterpiece, \"Calle Mayor\", as two of the most important works of the Spanish cinema, bar none, an achievement if considered the times in which they were done.",

         "Up until the last couple minutes of this film I was very impressed by DEATH OF A CYCLIST. It was an excellent and well-constructed tale about two individuals and the different ways that they respond to their perpetrating a hit and run that killed a bicycler. I especially appreciated how the lady and man responded so differently--with one eventually rising to the occasion and the other sinking deeper and deeper into evil. So as a character study, it was wonderful as well as very dark. However, in the last couple minutes a \"good ALWAYS triumphs over evil\" ending is tacked on the film that just doesn't work at all and undoes almost all the greatness of the film. The director apparently did NOT want to give it this cheap and horrible ending, but he was forced by the fascist Spanish government to include this ending against his wishes. And, true to the director's vision, the ending they used did destroy the impact of the film. What exactly the bad ending is you can see for yourself. It's really a shame because just before this final scene is one of the BEST scenes when one of the two criminals turns on the other one--a brilliant piece of film making. PS--It's interesting that after only a few weeks, this review has gotten three negative comments. If they score it this way because I didn't like the ending and found it took away from the film, this is ALSO the way the director felt about it as well. It was wonderful, but that ending just was a let-down and the director was understandably angry that he was forced to make this concession to the government censors. On the other hand, if the negatives are because I am dead wrong, then I willingly accept them.",
         "Breaking the Rules Juan Antonio Bardem's Muerte de un ciclista (Death of a Cyclist) The Formation of a Unique Hybrid of Spanish Cinema 1955. At the height of the cold war, almost twenty years under the Franco regime, Spain, a country fiercely divided by poverty and societal division prepares with the support of the United States, to enter into the United Nations. American investors arrive in Spain for the chance to buy into the developing Spanish economy. Meanwhile on a cold winter's day, dusk is falling and the Sun's dying rays hit the highway. Enrique Arízaga cycles past and off into the outlying horizon. Almost as soon as he has gone out of sight, a screeching of brakes is heard in the distance and a black car slams to a halt around the bend; the cricket chirps. A man jumps out and rushes over. On observing the cyclist is still breathing, he calls over to the woman, inside the car. She gets out and calls back over to him. The woman beckons him again to desert the scene of the accident, leaving the cyclist to die. The car moves off again disappearing towards Madrid. In the immediacy of its establishing sequence, Juan Antonio Bardem's Muerte de un ciclista (Death of a Cyclist) already outlines the foundations and circumstances behind the film's plot. An adulterous couple, Juan (Alberto Closas) and María José (Lucia Bosè) run down a cyclist on their way back to Madrid after a clandestine meeting in the outskirts. Rather than call for help the couple, fearful of the discovery of their adulterous relationship, flee the scene of the accident. Bardem's film focuses on the tribulations and strains on the characters' relationship from that point onwards and the lengths they go to keep their crimes of adultery and murder under cover. Spanish director Juan Antonio Bardem (1922-2002) explored and made use of a variety of genres within his early career. In Esa pareja feliz (1951) and ¡Bienvenido Mr Marshall! (1953), both joint ventures with contemporary Luis García Berlanga, Bardem through the conventions of comedy was able to develop a structure of parody and political satire. In Cómicos (1954), Bardem was heavily influenced by the genre of Hollywood melodrama, in particular that of films such as All About Eve (1950), a convention he would continue to develop throughout later films including Calle Mayor (1956). Throughout Muerte de un ciclista Bardem develops a compound of contrasting style and genre to represent key issues within Spanish society. Prominent themes and genres within the film include film noir and the femme fatale mould, the Hitchcock suspense thriller, Italian neo-realism and soviet montage. Bardem uses these contrasting elements directly after one another in order to create what Marsha Kinder refers to as a 'rupture' within the centrality of the plot of the Hollywood melodrama. In the same way as the unnatural cutting and contrasting imagery Bardem uses, the film is able to ideologically expose corrupt and immoral elements of the Franco regime. The focus of this essay is to explore and to investigate these various elements and analyse the way in which they come together in forming a hybrid that is unique within the history of Spanish cinema. Through the usage of a variety of contrasting elements and genre Bardem is able to ideologically expose the corrupt elements of the Franco regime. Today Muerte de un ciclista stands as a critique of the conformist values that it ridicules and attempts to tear apart. It breaks all the rules and shows the power of cinema to revolutionise daily life. In the same way as Bardem's characters of María José who breaks the conformist gender rules of Francoist Spain, Matilde who rebels against the institutional system and Juan who goes against the corruption and falseness of his class background, so too does Muerte de un ciclista rebel both by taking a stand against the corrupt Franco regime and also by breaking the rules of mainstream conventional cinema in order to present something vitally fresh and unique in Spanish film. Alfred Hitchcock once noted that it is important to know the limits of commercial cinema. Bardem is able to successfully use a clash of genre to stretch the viewer close to an absolute limit and is subsequently able to breakdown and underline the key political issues surrounding contemporary Spanish society. In the same way as the moral courage that the character of Juan is able to attain, Bardem seeks to signify the same moral fibre that the Spanish regime strove to repress. Like the broken window imagery that Bardem puts forward towards the end of the film, so too does a hole within the melodramatic centrality serve as a central element within the film's plot in order to be clashed with and torn apart. It is through this hybrid and \"rupture\" of genre that Juan Antonio Bardem's Muerte de un ciclista has been able to create a quintessential feat in Spanish cinema.

         "on the Franco dictatorship, the class system of Spain in that era, and how people are in their own microcosm, and live in their own world until it is shattered by crime. Maria Jose Castro (portrayed by the lovely Lucia Bose) is married to wealthy Miguel Castro (Otello Toso). It is a marriage of convenience, she has everything she wants materially, but nothing of love or emotion left in the marriage. She spends her days in a circle of bored friends, attending lunches, but wishing to be with her lover Juan Fernandez Soler (Alberto Closas). The cinematography here is intriguing and sinister. Stark landscapes, cold winter, yet the people involved are comfortable and corrupt, drinking and dining. Of course the character of Rafa Sandoval (played by Carlos Casaravilla) is excellent and elemental to a pivotal part of the story. He has seen the couple in their car on the highway, but just how much he has seen he will not divulge to Maria Jose. It is an ongoing teaser that we watch in suspense...we are not certain what each character will do. Juan Fernandez, a professor of mathematics is merely existing, he resents his job which was acquired through his in-laws. He is tired of keeping up appearances. There is a twist and you should watch this film more than once for the subtle nuances and character actors who play a part in the mood. It begins with the death of a cyclist, but evolves into study of society, politics, and how people act out to endure their mortality, or the prison of their mortality. In the end it is their choice. 10/10.",
         "An excellent film and I've enjoyed the comments and observations. There's really not a lot I can add that hasn't already been written other than the following: For the most part, I don't see how the ending of this film can be classified as either being 'over-the-top' or as a 'deus ex machina'. I simply see it as the logical function of the analytical geometry motif Bardem employs throughout the film. Remember, Juan is an assistant professor of Analytical geometry and Bardem finds a number of ways to reinforce the idea throughout this fine crafted 1955 Spanish B&W film. In the opening scene we see a lone cyclist ride away from us and, essentially, out of the frame, but he never really leaves the film as he provides both a question and an answer to some of the many riddles this film presents to us. Early on, we see a mathematical formulation written on blackboard which shows a completed, albeit, circular construction: it is a wrong that is eventually righted, but, as in life, there is a cost attached. The music itself has a certain geometry and it too plays a role in the film. I may be wrong here but I don't recall Rafa ever completing an entire piece of music while at the piano. Juan eventually realizes his mistake (thanks in part to the incident set in motion by the blackboard scene) and wants to do what he thinks is the right thing by trying to correct the mistake, but there are just too many outside factors at play here for his solution to work. However, the geometrical motif is eventually completed - in its own ironic fashion - at the end of the film when the bicyclist apparently does the right thing and reports the accident. So,with that in mind, I think the ending is appropriate. Please note that I'm not saying that its the right ending or even the wrong one, just that its appropriate. But, if I've learned anything from watching Film Noir (and I'm not saying this is one -- although it does has a number of similar elements) sometimes you just have to let the idea of a clean & tidy plot go and allow the story find its own way home. Besides, there are just too many other great cinematic elements going on here - lighting, camera angles, acting, atmosphere - to enjoy rather than wondering whether or not the plot will be wrapped up in a nice pretty bow at the end. Symbolism plays a major role here as well: angular barren trees at the scene of the initial accident, athletes being timed while running around a circular track along with the ritualized marriage ceremony and funeral service -- which, in and by themselves, can be seen as a form of circular geometry as well. And, of course, there is the central issue of political allegory, but that's been discussed already. Sometimes, thanks to Hollywood, I think we tend to expect a story to have a 'neat and tidy' conclusion. As for me, I enjoy movies that are like life: because, to my way of thinking, I can't imagine all my big questions will get answered when my 'movie' ends either. peace, David \"One thing led to another and then he led with his left\" ~ The Dark Corner ~",
         "Juan Antonio Bardem's 1955 pelicula spectacular, Muerte de un ciclista, is a golden example of mid- twentieth century Spanish cinema going against the Franco grain. Bardem endured multiple battles with Spanish censors, and as many know he had to completely alter the ending in order to release the film in Spain. The corruption and lack of ethical and moral character of Spanish bourgeoisie is a main theme throughout. The two primary characters, Juan and Maria-Jose, refuse to deal with the moral consequences of hitting a cyclist and leaving him to die. In the beginning, both are too caught up in the selfishness of their own spoiled lives to be troubled by \"the nuisance\" of the cyclist's death. While Juan eventually has an epiphany that involves 'purifying' his corrupt ways by coming clean to the police, Maria-Jose is keen on keeping her wealthy and privileged position intact at all costs, even if it means murdering her long term lover, Juan. Many viewers have commented Muerte de un ciclista's end was simply too compromised by Francoistic constraints put on Bardem (the 'bad' lady dies after she murders the 'good' man), but I feel he did extremely well considering the dictatorship surrounding him as he made the film. With regards to the ending, I think Bardem's angle was more subversive and future-thinking than merely 'righting a wrong' to pacify conservative falange-Catholic values. Notice the intertextual elements of Maria-Jose's extreme close up shots when she's hanging from her car. As Jo Evans noted in the article, \"Sex and the censors: the femme fatale in Juan Antonio Bardem's Muerte de un ciclista\", this cinematic moment \"can be considered a reference to Mussolini's executed mistress Carla Petacci, hanging upside down in the Piazzale Loreto next to her lover, Franco's former ally.\" Bardem could have shot Maria- Jose's body in a variety of creative death poses, but he chose this one in particular to include in the film. Thus Bardem shows in these final moments his wish for death to the corrupt bourgeoisie, and the possibility of death to Francoist Spain, Italy's one time fascist mistress.",
         "These deus ex machina endings are simply a reminder from the director: this is a movie. Sure, it's a shock, but there you have it. I found this to be a wonderful film, even more so in that the Spanish (with subtitles) was easy enough that I could understand most of it. I don't think one has to be embroiled in the politics of the time to understand it. Like all great art, it works on many levels. The lead actress is not just selfish, she represents the life force -- the will to succeed, accompanied by the corruption that goes with all success. By the same token, the hero could be seen as finally possessed by a death instinct, the urge to purify oneself by relinquishing all desire to live normally. I was rocked by many little surprises during the film. I liked the moment at the end where the actress plays with the different options open to her as she turns the key. This is no doubt far-fetched, but I remember a scene in King of Marvin Gardens when the actress plays with the gun and chatters about what might be done with it. The critic/blackmailer was an amazing actor, and it was a pleasure watching the change of attitude in the woman who was failed in the course but who came to admire the teacher responsible for her failure. I liked the hero's talking about our repeating mistakes like bugs running into a mirror, but how the glass had been broken. I remembered the many Bergman moments with insects running into glass -- I think there was one in Passion of Anna, for example.",
         "Having gone on bicycle tours across parts of America and China, I was immediately interested in this story about a couple involved in an illicit affair who accidentally kills a cyclist on the way home from a shady rendezvous, and decide to leave the man, still alive, to die on the road rather than take responsibility for their actions. You see, they would face not only the criminal repercussions of vehicular manslaughter (whatever that implies in Franco- controlled Spain), but also the destruction of their reputations, which is presented as the worse of the two consequences. I studied Spanish cinema when I was in college several years ago, but a lot of what I have learned about Franco's stifling regime and its effect on the film industry has faded somewhat. Mostly what I remember from that class is that Pedro Almodovar films are just not my thing. But the social commentary about upper class life in mid 1950s Spain is still pretty clear, and my understanding is that it was a scathing indictment of parts of the upper class at the time of its release, and I always appreciate movies like that. Maria and Juan are involved in an extramarital affair, and after the accident, they agree to cover it up but their guilt evolves in different directions, allowing for some almost Hitchcockian suspense through much of the movie. There is a man named Rafa who apparently saw something, and there is a wonderful device for suspense as Juan and Maria try to discover if he just saw them together in the car, which would have been an unseemly act in itself because they are both married, and not to each other, or if he also saw the accident. They don't know and neither do we, and you can feel the strain that it puts on them as their \"normal\" worlds gradually crumble. It's interesting the way the police involvement is portrayed. There are two motorcycle cops discussing the dead cyclist and hypothesizing about how he was killed. The prevailing theory seems to be that it was a truck, and they laugh at the suggestion that it was a couple on an illicit affair. Maybe they don't realize how strange truth can be sometimes. The development of the story involving Rafa is also beautifully handed. He holds this threat of exposure over Juan's and Maria's head, finally in a drunken rage telling Maria's husband the whole story about the affair. This is a frightening occurrence, but he doesn't believe Rafa, basically condemning him as a liar but clearly looking at his wife in a slightly different way from then on. It is uncertain at this point whether Rafa's revelation of what he saw and Miguel (Maria's husband) not believing him will cancel out the Rafa threat or only serve to pull the rope tighter, as now Miguel will be watching both of them even more closely. The social commentary is at it's most obvious in two particular scenes in the film. One is one in which the students at Juan's school where he teaches gather en masse outside of his office, organized to demand his resignation because of a supposed love affair that he had with one of his students. That student comes upstairs to talk to him, and he tells her that the demonstration doesn't bother him at all. It doesn't matter if they want him fired or promoted, he explains to her. \"They just want to shout.\" Later, after the threat of Rafa seems to have been removed (and after he inadvertently let them know that he didn't see the accident after all, Maria becomes visibly relaxed and tells Juan that she hopes they can do something for the victim's family, \"Now that we're safe.\" Juan, however, wants them to turn themselves in, leading to a great tense scene near the end where he is trying to convince her that they should go to the police, while she is sitting behind the wheel of her can, contemplating running him down. One of the things that the movie does best is to show that lies beget more lies, and covered crimes can also lead to more crimes. Unfortunately, the end of the movie drags a bit, running too long for the tension to remain high, giving it a feeling that it is spread a little too thin. There is a nice piece of symbolism in a beautifully framed shot near the end of the movie that is so good that it seems automatically to become the iconographic image of the film. It's an interesting story of deception and murder and the subsequent effects of trying to get away with it in an oppressive society. A fascinating depiction of disintegrating upper class Spanish life!",
         "A mix of noir psychological thriller and political examination of class and privilege in Franco's Spain, this reminded me as much as anything of Antonioni's 'Story of a Love Affair', although I liked this even more. For me there were more thematic and emotional levels explored in more interesting ways. The film is beautifully made with a striking use of transitions to keep us off base, and an alternating mix of neo-realist, and slick Hitchcockian camera work that evokes the separation of class in society. The story is simple. A pair of upper-class lovers accidentally hit a cyclist on the highway, and leave him to die, for fear of being discovered as lovers and losing all they have in society and with each other. The rest of the film is about both the moral questions of responsibility and ego versus a sense of communal responsibility, and the gut wracking tension as to whether the two will be discovered. I was occasionally bothered by the heavy handedness of some of the film. Sometimes it was just a too on-the-nose politically ironic line, but particularly an important sub-plot about a student the male half of our anti-hero couple, has treated unfairly. This sub-plot, while beautifully shot and well acted, feels like it exists only to make political and thematic points, and pulled me out of identifying with the film on a human level. Likewise, a couple of crucial character twists, while interesting, feel forced or sudden -- more there to make a point then to honestly continue the narrative. But these are small flaws compared to the film's great strengths, and it is very much worth seeing."
