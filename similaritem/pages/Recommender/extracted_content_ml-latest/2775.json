         "Head On is an amazing film. Its beauty and treasures lie in not judging the journey taken in the film but opening up to the experiences of a young man lost and hidden. Its not a bright, gay film but rather a fiery drama which doesn't offer answers but depicts a painful truth which many would prefer to disregard. This is a film about the loss of hope in the jaded nineties. It is very much a local film (shot in Melbourne) and an Australian film, but I think it offers up wider and more general issues. Few films capture the mood of the 1990s quite like Head On. It is a film embedded with characterisitics which intuitively identify the strangely blank decade that edged up to the 21st century. If the eighties was - though simplistically - regarded as the decade of high paced materialism. The 90s can be seen as a time of conservatism and cautiousness - again too simplistically - which could be regarded as the tired decade. A time imbued with a feeling that everything had already been done. Grunge embodied this, as did the increasing popularity of pastiche and remakes such as the way television shows were more and more the source for films. It was a time where even moreso than in previous decades - the answers and ideas were sort in ready-made forms. Reused, resurrected and exploited. Sarcasm and cynicism became law. Pettiness became more and more common. Many of us were just tired out. Ari, the central character in Head On played with brilliant vibrant vividness by Alex Dimitriades, is the embodiment of this tired feeling. He reacts to the world by going to extremes in an attempt to register some feeling, a momentary intensity. Since there is nothing new to be found, he embraces fleeting bursts of passion and uses anything that helps him escape the exhausted sensation whether through drugs or sex, people or music. Anything that he can do to keep himself isolated and inside his own individual mind, he races toward. Head On. He's gay but not proud. He's Greek-Australian but not interested. He's young but may as well be old. History is an excuse to crap on and foster negativity. Ari can't contemplate love because he's lost between the cracks of a society he doesn't care for and doesn't want to contribute to maintaining. He doesn't trust but he yearns, somewhere deeply, for some sense of security or truth. The film follows his search for reason in the chaos of his life in a world of silences and charades. But for Ari, there can be no reason. He feels doomed. Sensation is his only food, the only way to quench an indiscriminate, blind thirst. Dimitriades puts his body and soul into the role of Ari. Its the performance of commitment and intense passion for the role. He doesn't flinch at the frontal nudity or gay sex scenes as other actors might have and hence brings to the role an authenticity which is the spine of the film. But the supporting cast are equally well cast and powerful. Paul Capsis radiates every scene as Toula/Johnny, Ari's gender-bending cousin. Julian Garner is perfectly contrast as the one person who loves Ari enough to try and show him hope rather than dismissal. In fact, the script ensures even the smallest roles are provided with weight through the powerful and serious screenplay. The book from which this film was born - Loaded by Christos Tsiolka- is an excellent expansion of the films vision. The soundtrack is split between roaring alt-rock and techno-pop with some interesting surprises. The whole film comes together with a precision and ease which never feels unnatural or artificial. This is a raw but tight film. It deals with issues intelligently and strongly without judgement or fear. The loss of hope shown here is left to be dealt with in our own lives, and with the people we meet. I think the film provides a welcome opportunity to reflect on the destructiveness of notions like identity and truth in a world which increasingly blurs examples that aren't suitable or fashionable.",
         "Disturbing, powerful look at a few days in the life of a gay Greek-Australian man named Ari. He's very handsome, muscular, young (21), lives unhappily at home with his parents, is closeted, addicted to drugs and prefers anonymous, degrading sex. He can't find a job or any escape. Then he meets hunky, attractive Shawn who loves him. Will this change his life? The answer may surprise you. This is NOT a feel-good gay film. It's bleak and depressing but just great. Alex Dimitriades is very good in a difficult role--the sex scenes are degrading and brutal and there's a humiliating interrogation scene by the police. Dimitriades deserves credit for appearing nude (a great body, by the way) and showing frankly how much Ari hates himself and feels he deserves all the pain he's taking. Obviously this is not for everyone but I find it an incredible portrait of a thoroughly destroyed man.",
         "The kettle is on the boil and 19 year old Ari is about to burst with a combination of his culture, sexuality and drug intake, colliding to create a mixed up youth with a cause. His parents migrated to Melbourne, Australia, from Greece and with them they brought their strong culture that they hang onto while back in Greece the culture changes with the times. This we don't see but it is the fact of life for every second generation immigrant who has to fight the ignorance and hypocrisy of their parents and social surroundings. This creates a monster Ari carries on his back, a destructive energy within him that is wasted in back street alleys, public toilets and where ever he can get it. And when people don't come to his side of life, he manipulates them with sexual advances, testing their moral grounds. Through his love of Greek dancing, Ari yearns to keep part of his ancestral culture intact for identity purposes, but with his own freedom of passion. Can the two mix? That's what he's journey is. A journey for self expression without any rules of repression. This is Alex Dimitriades' cake as he eats Ari up and plays the character with conviction. Director Ana gets right into the heart and soul of Ari, via the camera with a confronting script dealing with issues aimed at any migrating culture.",
         "After getting thoroughly discouraged by the (lack of) quality of films that hit the gay circuit/film fests, this one reaffirmed my faith that a film can include gay subject matter and shed light on the human condition without compromising artistic vision. GLAAD's bevvy of media Nazi's hasn't completely destroyed cinema, but you do have to look outside the US to find it. Of course, the fact that it's a straight woman from Australia that directed this gem should surprise no one. In fact, it seems that the only good films that include homo themes are made outside the US. Most US films on this circuit are made & consumed by bourgeois gay men, for whom the ideal life & dramatic interest is replaying \"The Big Chill\" but with a gay twist (the straight version wasn't any good, why would a gay one be worthwhile?). Head On succeeds because it presents its subject matter (the pain & difficulty in dealing with one's sexuality as an ethnic minority) honestly. In spite of the existence of many social & political organizations, the gay \"community\" (a misnomer if there ever was one) is hardly a welcome wagon for ethnic minorities, suffering the consequences of racism, economic disenfranchisement, etc. Let's face it, gay men spend more time in bars & seeking casual sex than they do in helping someone find a job or housing, so any comments that this portrayal is \"negative\" are clearly missing the point of the film. In spite of the development of many organizations in this day & age, men have become sexual objects more than ever before (moreso for ethnic minorities who are often fetishisized for their ethnicity). This makes Ari's character quite appropriate. The world of gay running clubs & PFLAG meetings are just as invisible to Ari as he is to them (except of course if he were to take his shirt off). He bounces back & forth between the world of johns & drag queens/drugs with the world of his family........neither of which he finds comforting. In such a scenario, sex is more of a release of frustration or an attempt at bonding which was doomed before it started. He blows the one chance he has to change this precisely because he never had the tools/experience to handle a relationship. Though the film is emotionally draining (not necessarily a bad feature), it is true to its subject. Anyone who denies this is not being truthful to themselves.",
         "Head On is almost certainly the best film I'll see in 1998. I saw The Travelling Sydney Film Festival on the same weekend. So Head On is in exalted company indeed. And Head On is an Australian Film! Our strongest artistic expressions are cross cultural; those mergers and clashes that result from our second and third generation migrants growing up in Australia. Until the last few years we Aussies have tried to kid ourselves that we are exclusively Anglo Saxon people on the big screen, conveniently forgetting Eastern European and Asian migration, not to mention our Aboriginal brothers and sisters. So we've tended to wallow in vague Dad And Dave rural soapies, Horse Operas of the Phar Lap type or nostalgic, ANZAC and Breaker Morant homages to the mother country, ignoring the fact that we are one of the most urbanised countries on the planet, and that most of us have parents who weren't from within five hundred ks of London. Head On is about Ari (Alex Dimitriades), a 19 year old homosexual Greek Australian living in St Kilda Melbourne. He's a lost soul, enveloped in a broiling sea of parental conflict, drugs and sex. He's \"not proud to be Greek. He just is.\" A myriad of urban dilemmas are raised in Head On, nearly all of which are profoundly realised, but only through the briefly attentive eyes of a spaced out malcontent like Ari. I was reminded of that masterful scene in that early Scorcese film called Mean Streets; a scene which has never been bettered at showing what it is like to be drunk. But Ari isn't only drunk, he's on a cocktail of speed, cocaine and God knows what else and he's full of resentment. There's a scene in Head On where he and another unhappy soul, his cousin Betty (Elena Mandalis), slump in a toilet together, sharing their unhappiness, in a brief interlude before the madness resumes. It's a poignant, sad scene, where we realise just how desperate and empty lust and drugs alone can be. But when Ari is offered love he rejects it, violently. And that's a pattern repeated in Head On. People lurch in and out of Head On who have yet to, or one suspects may never, achieve a viable feeling of self worth. They strike out against commitment and self worth, indulging in hedonism because they can. Their parents have made the sacrifices. That looks boring to the children. Materialism is as easy as the next drug deal. Love is as easy as the next screw. Head On (the alternative title Hard On is a particularly apt Freudian slip, one that I've been guilty of) is about the alienation of youth, particularly homosexual youth. It's also about the generation gap, magnified by Ari's Greek migrant parents. And Head On is about a dozen other, contemporary urban issues. Racism is addressed with some feeling, in the film's weakest segment, but Ari's not too concerned really. He's reasonably happy just if he gets stoned and laid; sad but true of so many. Writer/director Ana Kokkinos has masterfully introduced us to the Ari's turbulent St Kilda world. Her film is fascinating and world class. Alex Dimitriades (Heartbreak High) is fantastic. Head On is spot on.",
         "Truly a great little movie! The story moved at a good pace through-out and kept me very interested to see what would happen next. With so many movies these days, I keep checking the time because they are so terribly uneven and my interest is not held. Not with this one--very riveting and moving story. It did an excellent job of \"showing\" what our young protagonist (someone used the term anti-hero for him--I like that) was going through. Really liked the way the drug highs were portrayed. The voice overs were sparse--this film did not talk me to death or insult my intelligence by explaining everything. How very refreshing! Visually you went with Ari where he was going whether you liked it or not. I also really liked it because it was at times raw and visceral--life is like that sometimes for us, and for others like Ari, it's like that most of the time. Hurray for the male frontal nudity! It's not only women that have beautiful bodies. Johnny only had a couple scenes, but he upstaged Ari in every one. What a remarkable character to throw into the mix! I would be friends with him in a heartbeat. If you like movies about real people trying to figure out their place in the world, do yourself a favor and see this film.",
         "Wow! What a powerful film! I have seen it twice and am amazed at the grip it holds on the viewer. The cast performs brilliantly. The themes are difficult and honest--our hero (who really is an anti-hero) recognizes his faults but cannot overcome them. No comic book, Hollywood film this! It is brutally honest with all its characters and so rich in acting and Greek music that I must say it ranks as one of the finest films I have seen in the past 10 years. Yes, the ending is sad, tragic, but real. Four stars for this excellent effort.",
         "Alex Dimitriades is stunning as a nihilistic young Greek-Australian on a wild binge. This talented actor pretty much carries the film on his broad shoulders, having totally immersed himself into the antihero's persona. Dimitriades leaves no stone unturned in responding to Director Ana Kokkinos' explicit direction. One may feel revelation or revulsion, but one cannot easily dismiss the impact of Kokkinos' graphic images and depictions. How one values this film will depend on personal taste. At the foreign film series in which I saw it, the audience was completely drawn into the drama, responding to subtle lines, and one could feel the deep involvement of all the viewers. Jill Belcock's sharp editing and Nikki DiFalco's atmospheric production design certainly enhanced the proeedings. At times one felt one's sensibilities being assaulted under the sheer impact of the presentation. The value of the film from a personal perspective is a quite realistic slice-of-life consideration of a quintessential \"looser,\" and being able to identify (if not fully sympathize) with his alien plight. It is also an informative dramatization of a subculture which has become quite ingrown in its attitudes and customs. Its community has become so exclusive that its larger Australian setting becomes of secondary importance. Dimitriades brilliantly depicts the contradictions and confusions of his character, depleted of creative energy by physical and emotional abuses. It is a performance of enormous courage and conviction, which becomes almost hypnotic as the film progresses. \"Loosers\" are not normally satisfying subjects for dramatizations, especially characters who fail to grow, and who in the end are little or no different from the way they were in the beginning. It is therefore all the more commendable that Kokkinos' fine cast manages to involve the viewer in an endless series of unforgettable images and scenes, creating a powerful mosaic of lasting impact.",

         "When the booked \"Loaded\" was released the author explained that the reason he wrote the book was that there were already enough gay friendly movies and books out there to allow him to write an honest portrayal of gay life. It is not negative, it is simply honest. Ari (played by the Hunk of Australian TV and movies Alex Dimitriades) is a young Greek man who is gay but is definitely not going to come out of the closet. He desires nothing more than to have a girlfriend, a family and be normal. But he knows he can not. So we follow on day in his life. It starts with him masturbating in the house he slept the night. He then faces a day of numerous challenges. Losing his money during a gay encounter (of the wink wink, nod nod, go into the back alley for a head-job type encounter). Getting the money so he can buy drugs, more sex, more drugs, more sex, drugs (surely it would fall off with that much use), police harassment. But there are ways out. He can be a gay guy and have a loving open gay relationship, he can marry a lesbian and pretend to be straight, he can even go to the extreme and be a drag queen or he can stay the way he is. This movie is packed with messages. Every scene has a meaning and as a result it is often considered pretentious. It is a movie about being gay and the issues with it. What makes it different is it doesn't spend the whole movie agonizing over the issues and boring the audience stupid, instead it bombards you with them leaving your head spinning by the time you leave the cinema. Oh...and if you love big dark skinned, dark haired Greek guys you will love this movie."
