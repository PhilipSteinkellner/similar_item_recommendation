         "I saw this movie two weeks ago and was very impressed. I believe that, no matter how great translation English speaking viewers get, they will still be lacking the profound message the movie sends. It certainly caught every single detail of a Bosnian house and family along with relationship between husband and wife, love for grandchildren and inevitable involvement of neighbors into everybody's life. Even though it certainly contains comic elements, it also brought tears to my eyes several times. 'Amidza' and 'amidzinca' reminded me of my late grandparents and all the attention I was getting in their house. All credits to Sasa Losic for music and soundtrack. Well done!",
         "How to describe this movie without writing \"it is a wonderful movie\" million times is a heavy task. Namik Kabil, one of more active screenwriters in the Balkan wrote a fantastic screenplay about a normal life in a shadow of a lingering death, which was converted into the fantastic movie by promising director Pjer Zalica and a fantastic crew of actors and tech. IndieWIRE had it right when they said this was one of the best 15 undistributed movies in the 2004. In my opinion it was the best movie in 2004, much better than LOTR:Return of the King, who cleaned up Oscars for that year, and far, far better than Les Invasions Barbares, which won the best foreign film Oscar. If I said this film is about Fuke (Senad Basic) visiting his elderly uncle and aunt Idriz (Mustafa Nadarevic) and Sabira (Semka Sokolovic Bertok), to fix their broken water-heater, you would think this must be the most boring movie ever, but it is far from it. It is as dreamy as early Italian new wave, but with the fragrance of Iranian films all brought together in this fantastic movie about feelings, and not action. The movie will make you think about the feelings projected without a word said. This is not sex-filled-bomb-blasted-car-chasing kind of film. This is a film about the rhythm of the life. It allows you to float into the steady current of their quiet lives and be touched by the love they have for each other. Wonderful movie, one of the best I have seen in my life.",
         "How many times did you see a movie made in a scenery of a land, torn apart by a war, in a city where not even one building has traces of that war. \"Kod amidze Idriza\" (for English speaking people: \"Days and Hours\" is such a movie. The movie starts with Fuke, a guy who visits his uncle Idriz and Aunt Sabira, to fix a broken boiler. He soon finds out there's a lot more that needs to be repaired. Idriz and Sabira aren't ready to accept the loss of their only son in the Balkan war, seven years earlier. When Fuke's car doesn't want to start Fuke has to stay in their house to stay over. He meets a lot of old friends and neighbours. It's so good to see a movie that really shows the effects of a war without even mentioning the war. The neighbours are a weird bunch of people, there a woman who seems to have borrowed a whole lot of plates from Sabira, there's the son of that woman who is boxing against a boxing ball and running around all the time. Real people who could live anywhere besides this little village in the hills near Serajevo. It's not a movie about heroes but a movie about sad people who want to live a normal life, said the giant director Pjer Zalica when I spoke with him at the Northern Dutch Movie festival. A real treat when you wanna see something else than a Hollywood movie !!!",
         "The native title of the film translates as \"At uncle Idriza's\". Imagine visiting your old grandparents in their village house, do not expect more than that, certainly nothing spectacular. However once you accept this fact, the film is very nice! The director's accuracy in portraying the typical is stunning! Every single detail of the people's habits, that I know by actually meeting people like the characters in the film, is there. I was quite fascinated to discover how much the same we are across families and even across countries, down to the smallest jests! This neighbourhood and these granddad and grandma could be in the outskirts of Sarajevo, could be elsewhere in former Yugoslavia, or could be in my country, Bulgaria... There is something that sets this Sarajevo apart though - the tragic and irretrievable loss of a son seven years ago. The war is invisible to us but thinly feels through, being part of the past of everyone there. Indeed, it is maybe the main point of the film to show us that a troubled society will naturally return back to a completely usual and inconspicuous life, yet the pain will never fully disappear within those generations. I would think the film might be too literally close to everyday life to be exciting for its native audience (as not a native to language, I could have missed slight hyperbolisation and humour?). It would be mostly appealing to those who have left their countries in the region, as a nostalgic memory of home, and for those foreigners with genuine interest in studying Balkan life. One day when the capitalist society, God forbid, has been completely established here and the family/kin/neighbourhood relations had fully disintegrated, the film will be also of great documentary value."
