         "\"Switchblade Sisters\" is one of the most awesome and amusingly incompetent trash/gangsploitation movies ever made; only back in the period when it got released nobody ever intended to make a bad film, of course. Personally, I enjoyed the privilege of seeing this film in a genuine grindhouse theater and with no less than writer/director Jack Hill present there to introduce the film and answer questions from the audience. Hill explained how he always dreamed of filming his very own version of Shakespeare's \"Othello\", yet this story was probably the closest he ever came to realizing that project. Irrelevant info, I know, but this just to illustrate \"Switchblade Sisters\" once actually was a remotely ambitious film and not just a piece of lesbian trash. The recent revival of drive-in & grindhouse cinema (courtesy of Quentin Tarantino, who's also a giant fan of this particular film) enlarges the sleaze-elements and silliness of 70's movies even more, but you should always at least try and see it in its framework of time. That being said, \"Switchblade Sisters\" is first and foremost a delightfully absurd gang-wars movie and a thoroughly flamboyant portrait of female empowerment. This baby has it all! Stereotypical gang members that easily look over 30 but still attend high-school, big fat ugly lesbian prison wardens, romantic rivalry, jealousy, treason, roller-skating shootouts, secretly desired rape sequences and \u0096 last but not least \u0096 female Maoist guerrilla fighters. Maggie is the ravishing and potent new chick on the block and she eagerly joins Lace's Dagger Debs gang after proving herself in a knifing contest. The Debs are the girlfriends of the Silver Daggers and all together they hang out in a ramshackle hangar to play pool and sell dope. There's a gang war with the Crabs in the offing and jealous Dagger Deb Patch inflicts a dispute between best friends Maggie & Lace when she notices they both fancy the same hunk. If you can overlook (and you simply must when you're interested in this type of cinema) the sometimes atrocious performances, one-dimensional characters and the absolute lack of logic & coherence, you will find great enjoyment here! The clichéd situations inside the penitentiary (with the obese lesbian warden), out in the schoolyard (with the nervous principal) and in the skating hall (random M-16 gunfire!) are all sublime. The whole finale, from the actual virulent street war up until the main Jezebels' showdown contest, is simultaneously suspenseful, spirited and even a bit touching. The soundtrack is great, although clearly not as enchanting as the ones featuring in Jack Hill's ultimate Blaxploitation masterworks \"Coffy\" and \"Foxy Brown\". Speaking of which, this movie perhaps lacks the powerful and attention-demanding presence of a starlet like Pam Grier, but the girls here are still more than adequate. The supportive characters are actually more convincing than the main ones. Lace, played by Robbie Lee, is an often intolerable and whiny child and Maggie simply appears too cherubic to play a rough chick. I vote for Patch to be the Jezebel's unhinged leader! She's unreliable, deceitful, mean and stark raving mad. Awesome film, highly recommended to slavering sick puppies like myself.",
         "This film is pretty much a second-rate Russ Meyer film (in fact, it was written by a F.X. Maier...coincidence??;) The dialogue isn't as clever, nor as tongue-in-cheek, and the acting is definitely second best. but on the other hand, Quentin Tarantino (who re-released it in '97 through Rolling Thunder Pictures) was right when he said in USA Today `There's more action is Sisters than in Twister\u0085' The film is fast-paced, full of thrills (gotta love those low-budget, campy 70s films where everyone loses their shirt eventually...) and most of all, fun! Aside from the few scenes that just seem utterly pointless, and aside from Robbie Lee's incessant whining, it's a great film to watch; full of giggles and smiles. As long as one doesn't take this film seriously, or compare it too closely to Faster Pussycat of Ultra-Vixens, it will be enjoyable to anyone looking for a cheezy laugh or three. And the prison scene is *priceless*.If I were to take it seriously it wouldn't rate higher than a five, but all things considered, 7/10.",
         "Sure this is a really, really stupid movie, but you've got to see it to believe it. The story of the toughest girls ever, The Jezebels, will leave you on the floor in a fit of laughter. Performed totally straight, this is like a really bad comic book brought to lurid life, complete with ear-wiltingly stupid dialogue. The action is so improbable that it may as well be taking place on another planet! Don't miss it, and look for Don Stark (Bob Pinciotti on \"That '70's Show\") in an early role as gang member \"Hook\"(so called because a unique anatomical feature). Drink a six pack of tall-boys and get ready to crack up; you won't be disappointed!",
         "It's a VERY cheesy movie, but in a great way that makes you laugh WITH the movie and not feel stupid. The movie is entertaining all the way and there's not one boring moment in it. I just love this movie! The fact that it's old only makes it look more stylish. Just wait untill you meet those nasty gang girls! Rent the movie and see it with your friends for a great night at home!",
         "Jack Hill's 'Switchblade Sisters' is a wild ride that will have you hooked from the get go! It's everything I hoped Ted V. Mikels disappointing 'The Doll Squad' was going to be - a trashy, campy slice of 1970s exploitation that manages to be self-parodic AND take its subject matter seriously simultaneously. Happily, 'Switchblade Sisters' is so good you'd think you'd dreamed it yourself. Robbie Lee plays Lace the Debs' leader, and fulfills all the promise she showed in Roger Corman's 'Big Bad Mama' the previous year. She's cute but deadly, and why she never became a major star is hard to fathom. Most of the other girls, particularly gang newcomer Maggie (Joanne Nail), and Lace's former second in command Patch (Monica Gayle), are also sexy and dangerous, but none show the sheer charisma of Lee's Lace, surely up there with Tura Satana, Pam Grier or Raven de la Croix as a proto-feminist icon of the drive-in era. 'Switchblade Sister' is trash par excellence. You will both laugh at and laugh with the Dagger Debs and their rival gang, the disco-dudded Crabs, who could easily walk off this movie and straight into 'The Warriors', another surreal gang movie, directed by another Hill, Walter. Both Hill's deserve their place in psychotronic history!",
         "Here's a girl gang film where the members wear leather boots and hot pants and pull tricks in their high school bathroom for five bucks a pop. So how can you not enjoy this? Story is about the Dagger Debs that is led by Lace (Robbie Lee) and she and her bunch of gals hang out with a boy gang named The Daggers. These two gangs go to the same high school and patrol the same turf and Lace is dating the Dagger leader Dominic (Asher Brauner) but they hear that another gang is to transfer to their area and conflict is inevitable. Lace and her gang run into a new girl in the neighborhood named Maggie (Joanne Nail) and after testing her Lace is impressed by her toughness. They all get busted at a burger joint and after the lesbian Warden and her guards try to rape Maggie the rest of the Debs get involved and beat them. Later Maggie gets out of juvenile hall and gives Dominic a letter from Lace but he puts the moves on her instead and practically rapes her. *****SPOILER ALERT***** Lace and the rest of the Debs get out also and plan on attacking a gang led by Crabs (Chase Newhart) but Lace hears that Maggie and Dominic have been more than friends. After a terrible shootout at a roller rink Dominic gets killed and Lace lands in the hospital but while she is mending Maggie starts taking over the Debs and renames them the \"Jezebels\". Lace's authority is challenged and she must reclaim her role in the gang as it's leader. This film is directed by Jack Hill who made a career out of making some of the best exploitation films of all time and helped make Pam Grier a star. Sure this is low budget junk but that's the appeal to these types of films. The dialogue is clumsy like \"If you leave me it's going to be bad\" and the casting has Lenny Bruce's daughter Kitty playing a chubby gang member named Donut who spends the entire film getting slapped around. But I did take note of the performance by Robbie Lee who has been described by many as \"Whining\" but I disagree with that and while I won't consider this on the level as Charlize Theron in \"Monster\" I do think her performance carries the film. Lee reminded me a bit of a female James Cagney with her toughness and the way she speaks through her teeth and there is even a scene where she flips a coin up and down while talking tough with the Warden. A few other familiar faces pop up in small roles like Kate Murtagh and John Voldstad but Monica Gayle as Patch does make an impact in her part and she seems to be secretly in love with Lace. Hill creates a silly but fun film to watch that has a few shots of nudity but the emphasis is strictly on action and melodrama and no matter how far fetched this is this is still a lot of fun to view.",
         "Film focuses on two gangs--the Silver Daggers lead by Dominic (Asher Brauner) and the Dagger Debs lead by Dominic's girlfriend, Lace (Robbie Lee). A new girl in town Maggie (Joanne Nail) joins the Debs and becomes friends with Lace--but Dominic wants Maggie. Evil Deb Patch (Monica Gayle) knows this and manipulates Lace into hating Maggie. Also there's a rival gang, the Crabs, who are trying to take over. Silly but very engaging trash movie--it's really an excellent movie OF ITS TYPE! There's prison fights, lesbian guards, rape, prostitution, feminism, politics, a black female gang and tons of violence and action. There's also a hilarious (and exciting) shoot out at a skating rink! There was a twist halfway through the movie that I didn't see coming and it all ends up with a climatic switchblade fight. I can honestly say I was never bored and enjoyed this thoroughly. The script is terrible but it never takes itself too seriously. As for the acting--Brauner is OK as Dom; Nail is lousy as Maggie and Lee is TERRIBLE as Lace--easily one of the worst acting jobs I've ever seen in a movie (and that's saying something). Gayle was actually pretty good as Patch. Also of note is Kitty Bruce (Lenny Bruce's daughter) who's character (Donut) is treated like dirt. The is NOT a good movie but an excellent trash film. Next to \"Coffy\" and \"Foxy Brown\" probably director/writer Jack Hill's best film... although he DOES call this a piece of trash. He's right!",
         "As in all thing's this was not made for everyone, it was intended to latch onto a genre that makes money, however, I think Jack Hill has done some great work with this, if one has an open mind, they just cant help but feel for the characters as the story develops, it's interesting the whole way thru, with lots of humor violence & sex involved.",
         "Fun little exploitation film by Jack Hill. It contains a few different kinds of movies all rolled up in one. Campy would be the most predominate though. The story follows the lives of the female gang, Dagger Debs, later called, the Jezebels, which by the way, was the original title. The gang meets a new fish named Maggie who at first fits right in with the gang but later has conflict with the leader, Lace. This movie starts out campy fun then gets real serious then back again. While this technique worked for the most part I felt this could have been a great serious film if it wanted to be. While only slightly bothered by the conflicting tones of the film, it is still a fun movie to watch. You really do even care about the characters by the end which is a compliment to its creators. Quentin Tarantino has often raved about the movie and there's enough good in it to like if you watch it with an open mind. Clearly the character of Patch, one of the gang members, inspired Daryl Hannah's character in Quentin's own \"Kill Bill 2\". Overall a fun little romp with some good special features on the DVD. Check it out!",
         "For whatever reason, Quentin Tarantino feels that Switchblade Sisters is Jack Hill's best film. And while I found a lot to enjoy in the movie, it doesn't come close in my mind to equaling some of Hill's other films like Spider Baby or the movies he made with Pam Grier. Not that any of Hill's films are set in reality as most of us understand it, but Switchblade Sisters is just too unrealistic for me rate among his best. The problem is with the casting decisions. The girl gang members aren't threatening. Why would anyone be threatened by Robbie Lee's Lace? She comes off more as a Girl Scout on her way to sell cookies than a vicious would-be killer. The other girls, from the too soft Donut to the too pretty Maggie, were no more convincing. The guys fair no better. Being stupid is not the same as being tough. I did, however, enjoy the over-the-top plot and action sequences. The final battle between the two gangs, the skating rink scene, and Maggie stealing Crabs' medallion were all cheesy highlights of the film for me. But my absolute favorite moment comes at the very end of the film. That speech Maggie makes to the cops as they are dragging her off to jail is incredible. Yeah, sure, it's as unrealistic as the cast, but it's a lot of fun. You don't hear dialogue like this just every day \u0096 \"No, let me give you some advice, cop. You can beat us, chain us, lock us up. But we're gonna be back, understand? And when we do, cop, you better keep your ass off our turf, or we'll BLOW IT OFF! Ya dig? We're Jezebels, cop - remember that name. We'll be back!\" Awesome stuff!"

The Daggers have a ladies' auxiliary, The Dagger Debs, who rumble just as hard as the men, but one day chief Dagger Deb Lace meets her match in Maggie, a new kid who won't back down. When a scuffle lands Maggie and the Debs in jail for the night, Maggie comes to Lace's rescue, and Maggie becomes Lace's new right-hand woman. However, fellow Deb Patch is jealous of Maggie's friendship with Lace, and begins spinning a web of deceit to destroy Lace's trust in the new deb. In the midst of the infighting, the Silver Daggers find their turf challenged by a rival gang who pose as a community action team, and the Debs join forces with a revolutionary political group."
