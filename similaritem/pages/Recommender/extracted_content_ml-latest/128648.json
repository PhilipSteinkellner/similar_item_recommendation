         "It seems like no one has really seen this film aside from a very few, and I tend to not see films until I've heard enough reactions because, especially with indies like this, they always seem to, well, not be so good. This surprised me a whole lot. I thought it was going to be a horror film, and on some level it is, but it plays out like a coming- of-age drama. It reminds me of Let the Right One in/Let Me In in its slow pace, atmosphere, and pair of leads at the core. I think it's pretty fantastically directed, and the script, while not without its flaws, does a really good job setting up these characters and really giving some meat to the story. I strongly recommend this",
         "I really enjoyed this movie. There is no gore or stupid special effects, and is a drama more than a \"scary\" movie. The acting is good and the characters believable. I agree with the other user that this is a haunting film as It left me speechless and melancholy. Please give this film a chance-there are parts that my husband seemed to be bored with, like maybe they dragged out too much for him, but I found every minute to be intriguing, endearing, or slightly disturbing. I would watch this again but I need time to recover from watching it the first time. It took something out of me and I believe this is because the characters are so real and you feel their emotions.",
         "The first time Jamie becomes alive is in his afterlife. He consoles another dead girl. A girl no one cared about when she was alive. Completely mistreated by her parents. She is in perpetual limbo as she cannot forgive her parents for creating the hell on earth that she had to endure while she was alive. Adam gets to witness the maturation of Jamie as he begins to find his place in the afterlife. This is a fresh and thoughtful movie about what it means to be loved. Only in death does Jamie begin to feel loved by other human beings. He was treated like a piece of trash his whole life and literally pizzed on by others. Only in death, can Jamie begin to have a friendship, unfortunately he..is dead. Adam is not dead, and as much as Adam wants to maintain an emotional connection with Jamie, he has his waking life to live. It's a very sad movie. I wouldn't call it a horror movie. Definitely not a shocker. It's an intelligent, well-made movie.",
         "A very nice piece of a movie. Sad and disturbing, but not a horror film. This movie should make you think about life and the meaning of it; The way we treat other people around us. It should make us remember our own mistakes and re-think them. It made me remember scenes out of my own school days. I turn almost 40 now, but that makes me sure- everybody above the age of 18, will definitely have similar memories. Love is a big message. Maybe sometimes we love to little or should show our feelings to other people more. I really did like that movie; The characters are well written and the storyline is perfect. Don't watch if you await a horror movie! It's more like a \"coming of Age\" Drama with a great message.",
         "This is truly an inspiring story about something more than just being a teenage and how hard can it be for some people. It teaches us that we can find a true friend in the most unlikely of places, that that friend can be someone we never expected. Maybe, if we go deeper, this could be a way to tell us to not waist our time waiting for the right moment, because that moment is now, at every hour, at every minute, at every second. It's not really a horror movie, but a sad coming-of-age one, with a fantastic and touching storyline, well-played characters and a peaceful soundtrack that makes it slow sometimes but never boring.",
         "A beautifully sombre and understated ghost story with full, believable characters and honest emotion. In the same way that Occulus reminds me, at times, of The Shining, and I am not fully sure why, this film reminds me of Donnie Darko, without bearing any real resemblance. Perhaps it's just a feel. The real take on teenage angst, free of any and all melodrama; the dreamy, surreal quality, where one is never sure if what is going on is occurring in the tangible world or in someone's, anyone's, psyche; or maybe that strange feeling that you are on the threshold of different states -- someone is ready to depart, another is clinging on to the known, to be reborn or hurled further into denial is unknown, and that's what makes this so effecting. Beautifully done.",
         "Jamie Marks is Dead is an originally told downcast drama about two teens brought together after a classmate is found murdered in a rural town. Carter Smith writes and directs Jamie Marks is Dead, drawing inspiration and adapting Christopher Barzak's debut novel One for Sorrow. Jamie Marks is found murdered, naked and discarded amidst the detritus of decaying tree branches along the side of a creek. Classmate Adam becomes sympathetically absorbed in the death of the teenage boy who was not popular and often picked on. He and Gracie, the girl who discovered the body, become close from the murder when Jamie's ghost begins to appear to each of them. Cameron Monaghan is Adam, the classmate inexplicably drawn to Jamie's death. Monaghan is a budding talent and brings a realistic and unexaggerated angst to the role. Jamie Marks is Dead is about the melancholic connection of the characters and unfortunately Morgan Saylor's Gracie and Noah Silver's Jamie fail to deliver. Jamie Marks is Dead is original, moody and extremely dark. We examine the character's familial and interpersonal relationships through Jamie's death rather than being a suspenseful mystery to unveil the killer's identity. All the pieces for the plot are there but for some reason it never comes together believably. Adam's preoccupation with Jamie's death seems unfounded, and the character's evolution that yields the resolution seems premature. The story itself is laid out extremely slowly. Director Carter Smith uses this time to create a gloomy outlook of the characters' world through clear and decisive cinematography. The film is beautiful to look at, capturing the dark and austere bleakness of rural life and balancing it with perfect lighting for watchable scenes.

         "I LOVED this movie. It's about a couple of gay teenagers who don't get to know each other until after one of them dies. I don't understand why other online reviewers keep saying how sad it is, because to me it's marvelously positive, encouraging, romantic and satisfying. Those reviewers must think death is a big deal. The story is fascinating and completely believable, which is extraordinary for a movie about the supernatural. The dialog is always perfect - economical and powerful. The direction, the acting by every actor in every role (especially Liv Tyler as Adam's neurotic mother and Noah Silver as Jamie - he's fantastic in a marvelously sweet, subtle and sexy performance), the cinematography, production design, sound, music, etc, could not be better. This is a fantastic movie. The only huge flaw is the Frances character. She's unnecessary, contrived, unbelievable and very, very annoying. I almost quit watching when she became such a huge part of the story. The fact that I didn't, and that I'm giving it ten stars in spite of her, is testimony to how very, very good this movie is.",
         "The title is very clear on one thing. Which doesn't mean we don't get to see the character (rather the actor playing that character) on screen. It's a very weird movie with a strange feel to it. It's tough to describe especially because our main character is very inactive and very closed to himself. But that makes him interesting (not only for the viewer but for other characters as you'll see). You might not agree and find this \"boring\", which is a possibility and wouldn't be surprising with a movie like this. But if you can stay and stick with this, there is something there that you won't find in many other movies. For better or worse this is different!",
         "A local boy is tormented by the ghost of a young man who was killed some time ago. Watching this for about 30 minutes for me was interesting but after I reacher 80 minutes I had to stop it because I was bored. The idea is good combining mystery with horror elements although is not a scary film but when I see a ghost immediately I think of the horror genre. This is more like a drama with sad elements in it. Still there are some flaws about the death of Jamie is not elaborate the viewer known only that he was murdered. The young cast did their jobs very good because the acting was tolerable. The dark atmosphere adds some extra chills, but even so it doesn't save the boring story, those long scenes made me finish the film in the second day. If you are a patience person then this is for you. Bottom line, a movie with both good and bad parts witch made me lower my vote cause of the boredom."
