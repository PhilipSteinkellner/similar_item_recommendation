         "Everyone knows how hard is to make a movie based on a comic book that really captures the feeling, and this one was made based on several comic strips, and I gotta say WOW they really made it. Based on several titles of Angeli, most of his characters are there. The screenplay deals with a lot of different comic strips , but they did a real nice job in a way that it flows like it was made specially for this movie. If you know the characters and read the strips the movie works like a recollection of greatest moments with a plot, if you never saw you'll have a bunch of puns and punch lines where no one is safe ( From Old Hippies to Communist Conspirators),Rita Lee as Re Bordosa (a real drunk-bukowski kinda girl) is a must see. Above all the expectations !!!",
         "I really like Angeli, and I think he's very talented, funny and intelligent but this movie was a very big disappointment. Very slow, poor in music and animation. Is a movie just for fans of the artist. The plot... well there's no plot, just repetition of what was published as comics, who read it, gets bored, nothing new happen. Even Rita Lee was really bad as Re Bordosa. I hate to say that but Angeli deserves something better than this worst than flash movie. Even Fritz the cat made in 1972 had a better animation. The voices of the characters are almost out of synchrony. I see the efforts to make something different but even as a low budget project one have to be very paternalist to say it is good.",
         "About 90% of this movie was wasted on recycling old jokes from the comic books. Rê Bordosa's dubbing was atrocious, she sounded like Mumm-Ra from the Thundercats. The movie's pace is mostly boring, and all the jokes follow the comic strip formula (line-line-punchline). The coloring is terrible as well, it looks like it was colored with photoshop. In 1996. It was very nice to see a lot of Angeli's characters in the movie, such as Mara Tara - a personal favorite. The ending was very good though. I wish the rest of the movie were as good as the ending. Next time, please hire a good writer. This way the movie would appeal more to the fans of the comic strips."
