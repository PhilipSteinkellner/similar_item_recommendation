         "...Nor is it any number of other Asian films I could name. The first time I watched \"Soo\" (2007, Korea) I thought it was boring. The second time I watched it I thought it was good but needed approximately 90 minutes edited out. Last night I watched it for the third time and was captivated from start to finish. It's truly one of the most effectively depressing films of the past decade, and is essential viewing for lovers of slow-burning, psychological, dramatic revenge films with heaping quantities of character development. The key to enjoying this film is to pay attention to the subtle details. Even the most ordinary dialogue is used meaningfully here. These characters have experienced horrific acts of death and violence in their pasts and have also experienced dysfunctional relationships with others. These dysfunctional relationships are communicated in a fragmented, nonchronological manner that's similar to most East Asian horror films. There's also some slight ambiguity, but only in little patches that can be filled quite easily with some common sense and logic. It's important to achieve that understanding though, because absent this understanding the viewer will never be able to appreciate the characters' suffering nor the motivations for their actions. And let me tell you, these are some of the most gloomy, disheartened, and interesting characters you'll ever see. The acting is what we've come to expect from South Korea, first rate. Joo-hyun Jun gives one of the best performances of her entire career. She's utterly convincing in an atypical, dark role that establishes her diverse acting range once and for all. Her depression isn't presented in a typical, psychotic, over-the-top manner. It's a very restrained exhibition, even in those few cases where she suffers a mental breakdown of sorts. The film uses her character's interaction with others, a steady tone, and a longer running time (2 full hours) to slowly but surely communicate her despair to the viewer. It's impossible not to sympathize with her and hope for her recovery. The quality of acting doesn't begin and end with Joo-hyun though. Everyone comes off looking well here. Another important point to make is that the entire foundation of this film is human suffering inflicted by humans. Contrary to what one might expect, there's really revenge activity present at all. Even the opening 30 minutes, which makes the film seem like it's going to travel oft-explored revenge themes, can be interpreted as entirely psychological. Almost all of the revenge sequences focus on disturbing historical events involving horrific accidents or murders that are presented in disturbing ways despite the absence of graphic violence. It might seem like an oxymoron to say that \"Art of Revenge\" has more balls than the slew of vacation torture movies of recent years, but it really does trump those movies in pure guts because the acts of violence here are inflicted upon very fragile, defenseless victims. Some sequences are, in fact, jaw-dropping because most filmmakers (and their producers) are too timid to show such things. This is a damn good film that somehow fell between the cracks during the oft-referenced (but not entirely accurate) period known as the \"hey day\" of Asian revenge (circa 1998-2005). I never hear it mentioned or referenced, but it deserves more attention than overrated, boring tripe like \"Oldboy\" (2003). Watch both films and it's fairly obvious that \"Art of Revenge\" is the better of the two in almost every conceivable aspect of film-making.",
         "The idea of the film is nice, but it's only good until the one brother dies. We also get some well shot cut-back scenes on how the brothers were separated in the first quarter of the film. Although some would call these scenes pathetic the don't fail to attract. But when the vengeance story starts the film gets bad. The reason is simple: logic leaves the story. The reaction of the dead brother's wife may be perhaps plausible for Koreans, they seem strange in European eyes. But OK, watching a film from a culture I am not really familiar with makes me overlook that problem. What I am really complaining about are major plot holes and a very unrealistic amount of injuries the main character can take without being really affected from them: After he is hit with baseball bats (among other things), subbed several times and shot at he can still walk and fight on. It also annoys me that in every fight scene the hero is almost always attacked only by one opponent. That's not the way gang thugs would do it. ------SPOILER AHEAD------------------ These are some of the plot holes: 1. How did the mobsters find out that the carpenter revealed the name of the firm? ( *assuming* he had to die for this betrayal) 2. Was knowing the firm's name plus the meager tip from the guy at the rooftop enough to really find out the mobster's location? We see how the female lead puts the facts together with a map, but what did your hero do? 4.Why does the hero return to the carpenter? What did he still want from him? 5 How did the police find out that the dead brother was involved with the mobsters ? 6. Where did the mountain climbing equipment for rappelling from the roof near the end of the film suddenly come from ?",
         "I like Korean movies in general. They have a certain style to them, but they also have some mannerisms, that are new (maybe even alien) to me, but are always great to watch. One of those things, is the violence that is portrayed in a gritty way. Not stylized and most of the time it doesn't even look like it's choreographed, but this raw power/energy has a vibe that translates great onto the big screen, like in this case. The problem here though is the story. It's a shame, because it could be a real great movie (especially with that showdown/ending), but it misses out on some points (at least for my taste). It makes for a nice viewing then, but never achieves grand status (in my book)",
         "SOO: REVENGE FOR A TWISTED FATE is one of those (extremely) violent revenge movies you either like or you don't like. I like it- up to a point. A PLOT point (or two), I should add. Sure, there are a number of things that just don't add up, but the CRAFTSMANSHIP involved here is impressive indeed. (Think about this: when was the last time you complained about the inherent logic- or lack of same- in, say, a Clint Eastwood western or a Chuck Norris one-man slaughterhouse movie or any OTHER so-called \"action\" movie...?) One rarely (if ever) plunks down money to see how the \"story\" unfolds in an ACTION movie. (If Logic were a prerequisite for an Action movie, the genre itself might not exist...) If it's Revenge and Action you're looking for, SOO: REVENGE FOR A TWISTED FATE has both- in spades.",
         "The fights are pretty much what I enjoyed in Soo. Raw, brutal fight using baseball bat, knives and metal pipes. This fights looks like they're not acting at all, it's a brawl out with chocking, eye-piercing, ducking, rolling, etc etc. Like Chaser, Bittersweet and Oldboy, I can only put the fight to be very realistic, imo. The rest are just bad and close to decent. I didn't try to scrutinize the story when I realized the plot holes keep getting bigger and bigger, enabling me to enjoy the movie. The revenge story is nothing new but the progress isn't noteworthy at all, not enjoyable really. Male lead is just bland as vanilla, female lead was given the ridiculous role of making advances to the male lead which she sees as a replacement. And the male lead just 'accepts' it, despite being seen as an image and not as himself. This scripted part just annoys me. The ending is just terrible and confusing. despite being sliced up pretty badly, the hero still managed to walk away from the bloodbath. Why did the female lead started shooting? And all of the sudden she started weeping, as scripted as that can be.The movie didn't end beautifully or epicly, just at some dark dirty corner! Soo is a sadly mediocre compared to other revenge tales like Sympathy from Lady Vengeance, Oldboy, Bittersweet Life and Chaser. If you like a good fight though, go ahead!",
         "The movie description on the back of my DVD cover (German release) compares this movie with 'A Bittersweet Life' and 'Oldboy'. Usually I wouldn't trust these cheap advertising lines of the distribution companies anyway but I was still lured by the \"revenge with a twist\" theme of the movie plot description. The first half of the movie isn't too bad at all, we get to know the killer trying to find his long lost brother. He finally finds out where he is and that he is a cop but at their first meeting the cop gets shot dead right before his eyes. As you'd expect the killer wants to find out who killed his brother and to take revenge. He takes the identity of his brother, disguises as a cop and starts the action. A series of flashbacks into their youth adds on to how they had been separated and introduces a few more characters. So far, so good... nice little twist in the script, killer turns cop, movie not bad so far. Unfortunately after that the movie gets worse and worse... plot holes, an almost never-ending overdone showdown ... I won't develop that much more, just read the previous 3 user comments who already pointed out most of the weak parts. As for a simple revenge action film the average viewer will normally accept a few plot holes but there are just too many and also the behaviour of the characters are just too absurd to take it seriously. To make it worse: choreography of the action scenes in the final showdown is too slow and almost makes you look for the 'fast fwd' button on your remote control. What does this movie then have in common with 'A Bittersweet Life' or 'Oldboy'? Except for the revenge theme and a stylish photography not much unfortunately. On the whole this movie is rather a waste of time. Don't hesitate to see 'A Bittersweet Life' however if you have missed it so far. Another nice one from South Korea is 'Mr. Socrates'. And I must admit that I had enjoyed Travolta's 'The Punisher' or 'Death Sentence' with Kevin Bacon more than this one...",
         "This movie is a total waste of time. it tries so hard to be dramatic in action and romantic sense but ended up stupid. the dialogs and the acts are just senseless. I don't know if that's the way Korean speak or it's just the moronic script. I guess it's the latter. Then the Soo who is supposedly a professional killer turns out to be just a mindless freak who can't die after numerous stabs and shots. no well-planned attack? always prefer choking than using his knife and letting himself got stabbed from behind? Even I could fight better when I was in junior high gang. Professional killer my ass. And what's with the annoying girl? The only good thing is he knows how to effectively stop downward cut from his opponents which is by locking the movement of the down-swinging upper arm. while the rest are just stupid. Whatever you do, don't watch this movie!"
