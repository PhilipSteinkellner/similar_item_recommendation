      "synopsis": "In the cellar of the local cursed castle, Satanists are cutting out the hearts and drinking the blood of virgins in order to keep alive their Great Mistress Isabella Isabella Drupel [Rita Calderoni], a witch/vampire who was staked through the chest and burned to death in the 14th century. They currently await \"the 25th moon\", when Isabella (chained to a wall and with a big hole in her chest) will be able to fully reincarnate in another body. Neither the stories about the castle being the site of the Inquisition, nor the heartless village virgins being found all over, nor the fact that some odd occultist [Raoul Lovecchio] and his servant are also living in the castle, phases Jack Nelson [Mickey Hargitay], the castle's new owner. In fact, one of the first things Jack does is to throw an engagement party for niece Laureen [Rita Calderoni] who is marrying a local boy, Richard Brenton [William Darni]. Jack doesn't care about the castle's notoriety because he is actually Count Dracula, and he's been waiting 500 years for the day when his beloved Isabella will return to him. He doesn't care about the occultist either, because it was he who helped remove Isabella's body from the stake all those years ago. In fact, many of the male guests are also vampires who have been awaiting Isabella's return, and most of the female guests are reincarnations of the same girls who were shouting \"Burn the witch!\" all those years ago when Isabella was suffering. [Herein insert a good 45 minutes of scenes with no continuity and even less sense, mostly of Isabella being staked and burned, the virgins being seduced by the vampires, Christa [Christa Barrymore] being buried alive and then returning as a vampire, lots of bare breasts and women being held by the torturers, and Laureen escaping from a tightening cage of knives and falling into amnesia about what happened to her.] This kind of stuff goes on until Richard stumbles upon one of the occultist's books that explains how Vampires need blood uncontaminated by semen (i.e., from virgins) and Jack and the occultist explain how everyone there has paid a role, past and present, in Isabella's death. It is the night of the 25th moon. All the vampires suddenly go on a feeding frenzy. Two of their victims escape but, while they are running through the valley clothed only in a black cape, a lightning bolt strikes a wooden cross and sets it on fire. The villagers see the cross burning and, like in the old days, start screaming there be witches here. The villagers attempt to kill the girls, but the occultist suggests that they be allowed to pass the altar at the crossroads where it is said no demon can pass without being incinerated. The villagers agree, and the two girls are promptly engulfed by fire and disappear, reappearing in the castle cellar where they rejoin the other girls being held as sacrifices to Isabella. Tired of all the mysteries and disappearing girls, Richard confronts the occultist who delivers the moral of the story: There is a thin line between the known and the unknown, the real and the unreal, and maybe the things we see are just the things we want to see. Profound? Meanwhile, Laureen has disappeared again. She has become the Chosen One, the one who will provide the eyes and ears of the reincarnated Isabella. Only Laureen must be a willing body donor. In a drugged state, it looks like Laureen is going to consent, but just as Isabella begins to awaken, Laureen cries out \"Monster!\" and the spell is broken. Laureen then kills Jack, and the next thing we know, Laureen is waking up in her own little bed oblivious to it all. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl]",

         "This movie is best known as 'The Reincarnation Of Isabel', though I watched it as 'Black Magic Rites'. It's also sometimes titled 'The Ghastly Orgies Of Count Dracula'. Anyway, whatever you call it this is one freaky movie! This kind of quasi-psychedelic Eurohorror is I admit an acquired taste, but as I'm already a big fan of this kind of thing I find it hard to be objective about it. Despite (or maybe because of!) an impossible to follow plot, plenty of lousy acting and any excuse whatsoever to get the babes topless this is one of the weirdest and most entertaining movies of this type I've ever seen! Rita Calderoni from 'Nude For Satan' co-stars with Mickey Hargitay, the former bodybuilder and husband of Jayne Mansfield, who appeared in 'The Bloody Pit Of Horror' (by the way, if you're curious you can see Arnie play Hargitay in 'The Jayne Mansfield Story'). If you've seen 'Nude For Satan', imagine it was re-edited by someone tripping on acid and you'll have some idea of what '...Isabel' is like! If I resort to cliches and say you have to see it to believe it, it's because it's true... The plot... well, who knows what the plot is about! Some guys dressed up like Satanic superheros are sacrificing virgins in an attempt to resurrect their long dead leader, the witch (or was that vampire?) Isabella, who was burned at the stake by angry villagers hundreds of years before. I think. Oh, and Dracula's in there somewhere but I can't quite recall why. There are lots of flash backs and just about everybody plays two roles, so it's quite difficult to work out what the hell is going on most of the time! But you know what? It doesn't matter. I loved every minute of it.",
         "Directed by Renato Polselli \"Reincarnation of Isabel\" has been long considered to be missing,disappearing after its failed initial showing in 1972-1973.The film is pretty confusing and badly written,so fans of bizarre Italian exploitation won't be disappointed.There is some gore and witchery plus plenty of sleaze.The women in this film take almost every opportunity to strip down-and that's not a bad thing in my book.A Satanic cult,as a part of an ancient rite to revive a witch who died 400 years earlier,must sacrifice a group of seven virgins.Trouble erupts when one of the prospective victim's lovers interrupts the rituals,and the witches turn into vampires and wreak havoc on the town.Renato Polselli managed to create a dreamlike atmosphere punctuated with many scenes of naked women attacked,raped,terrorized and murdered.Overall,I enjoyed this film and you should too,if you like Italian sleaze.",
         "A group of people are having a party in a castle one of them (Mickey Hargitay) has just bought. The castle is haunted by the malignant presence of a witch who was burned 500 years earlier and who, not surprisingly, looks just like one of the guests (Rita Calderoni). Yet another rip-off of Mario Bava's \"Black Sunday\"?--of course, but this movie is much, much more than that. All the male guests are either reincarnations of the earlier historical figures or vampires who have been living for centuries waiting for the opportunity to reincarnate the witch, Isabel. The women meanwhile are all virgins because, not only are virgins necessary for the ceremony, but as one character eloquently puts it, \"Vampires need blood uncontaminated by human semen.\" (This leads one dumb girl in a particularly hilarious scene to give up her virginity to her nymphomaniac friend and a fat, ugly guy with a severe facial twitch). Obviously, the main appeal of this movie is sex and nudity, but anyone watching it SOLELY for that purpose might be a little frustrated as this a Renato Polselli film, a man whose directorial style can best be described as completely deranged. While there are acres of flesh on display here, Polselli often seems more interested in the bizarro camera angles, the staccato editing sequences, and the pulse-pounding score than he is in lingering on the action like some of his hack contemporaries (or more modern-day \"erotic\" filmmakers) would have done. All the actors and actresses from Polselli's more famous film \"Delerio Caldo\" show up again here, and while the latter are even more naked than they were in \"Delerio Caldo\", some of them turn out to be pretty untalented as thespians(and Polselli doesn't have the good sense to kill them off quickly like he did in the other film). Meanwhile, the stronger actors like Hargitay, Calderoni, and Krysta Barrymore are pretty much wasted in the incomprehensible chaos the film quickly descends into. Regardless of whether you like this film or not, however, I GUARANTEE you'll never see anything else like it.",
         "Well you sure can't fault director Renato Polselli for not trying to entertain us that's for sure. The Reincarnation of Isabel like his deranged giallo Delirium before it is a non-stop barrage of sleazy thrills and gore. Polselli was certainly not a director who could be accused of being understated. His films are deranged and borderline incomprehensible, and full to the brim with naked women. He was clearly an unashamed exploitation film-maker who just got down to it and served up the goods with no consideration whatsoever to good taste and decency. But you know what? His movies do have a definite style � albeit a pretty haphazard one. The Reincarnation of Isabel is a perfect example. It's about a group of vampires who keep the body of a witch in the basement of a castle, awaiting a chance to resurrect her with the blood of several virgins. Cue the arrival of a party of knuckle-heads with the requisite gaggle of � deeply unconvincing � virgins. I suppose it's a rip off of Mario Bava's Black Sunday in a way. Not that you'll probably notice as other than the witch idea it's a pure sleaze-fest with some gory violence chucked in for good measure. Every woman who appears in it gets naked and is terrorised at some point. Its sexist stuff of the first order naturally, although not quite as misogynistic as Delirium. The story sort of makes sense some of the time but you'll be forgiven for wondering what's going on a lot of the rest of the time. Polselli's haphazard style is the reason for this, as scenes are edited together bizarrely and characters act in ways that can only be described as insane. The film stars the always entertaining Mickey Hargitay and Rita Calderoni, both of who appear in Delirium along with most of the other cast members from that film. I was also astonished at the appalling haircuts sported by most of the girls � in virtually every other Italian production from the time the women all look like they have been groomed by super-chic stylists; the chicks here look more like they have been dragged through a hedge. But what the hell, they all get naked right? Anyway, the soundtrack is pretty good - quite moody and at times psychedelic, while the camera work is sometimes inventive and the dungeon set is admittedly pretty funky. Overall, it's a very commendable example of Euro-Trash. Senseless? Yes. Gratuitous? Of course. Laughable? At times. Entertaining? Oh yeah.",
         "\"Reincarnation of Isabel\" is a great example of good Euro-trash. It triumphs over its obviously low budget through a combination of gore, unintentional humor, a great score, flashy camera work, and large amounts of gratuitous nudity. It is surprising that this movie has not received a cult status yet, being that it is better than many cult movies. Thanks must be given to Redemption (the company that put this out) for finding a print of this movie, which was long considered lost, and giving it its first domestic release ever. The \"plot\" is as follows: A woman named Isabel is burned at the stake when the Inquisition comes to her small village. Apparently they are not too far off, either, because she actually was a witch. Her husband and another local take her body and put it in the dungeon of a castle. Flip to present day: The husband and some of the locals who were on his side have been reincarnated (no explanation is given), and through some twist of fate know it. The husband then attempts to reincarnate Isabel with the hearts of young virgins in some satanic ritual. There is actually much more to the plot (something to do with vampires, and many unnecessary characters), but it all becomes a confused mess. This lack of plot can be forgiven, though, because the plot is not what the movie is trying for. \"Reincarnation of Isabel\" is one of the most enjoyable Euro-trash movies, containing everything one has come to expect from this genre. Well, not quite everything. This movie unfortunately lacks in violence and gore. After the violent opening, the movie contains no more realistic effects (it does, however, contain some unrealistic effects. For example, a few \"witches\" are scratched with sticks, which is fine and dandy (they were topless, after all), but the effect was so cheap it was unintentionally humorous. It was achieved through the use of rubbing a blunt club with wet paint on the end against the skin of the two \"witches.\"). The fake violence was not the only source of unintentional humor; the subtitles were actually much funnier. On the plus side, the acting was surprisingly good and solid, the music was decent, and the direction was pretty solid. It should also be noted that \"Reincarnation...\" gets better with every viewing. It should be viewed at least twice to get the wanted effect. Recommended for all fans of Eurohorror. My rating: 7 out of 10.",
         "If the box indicated non stop naked female sacrifice, who would believe it? Well, there is, from the opening credits to the closing title. In between such scenes there is the odd bit of vampirism, some Italian style Gothic horror, psychedelic moments with coloured lights and mini skirts and even time for comedic moments, not forgetting the non consensual threesome and other odd sexual antics. Total nonsense of course and seemingly two or more films stuck together judging by the jumps from misty castles to crystal clear soft core. But, who cares? It looks good most of the time, at no moment does everyone have their clothes on and the soundtrack although appalling is varied. Not much horror but some stunning images, some great faces, and lots of lovely Italian girls happy to show that they are lovely all over.",
         "Jack Nelson (Mickey Hargitay) arrives a gloomy looking castle with his fiancé Laureen (Rita Calderoni) and strange things start to happen immediately. Why? The hell if I know but it is somehow related to Laureen being the reincarnation of Isabella, a witch who was staked and burned alive 500 years ago. Oh, and there are some vampires wandering around too. This is my second Renato Polselli flick (after the previous year's DELIRIUM, also with Hargitay) and I'm not quite sure what to make of it. It is great in spots (moody lighting and an interesting editing technique) and completely lousy in others (totally fake rubber bats and easily exposed black backdrops outside of set windows). The biggest problem is it runs way too long (1 hour and 49 minutes) and doesn't make a lick of sense. Worth seeing once just for the 70s feel and the abundance of nudity.",
         "Renato Polselli's \"Riti, Magie Nere e Segrete Orge Nel Trecento...\" aka. Rites, Black Magic and Secret Orgies in the Fourteenth Century aka. \"The Reincarnation of Isabel\" (1973) is a clear case of style over substance that might well appeal to my fellow fans of bizarre Italian Horror / Exploitation productions whereas others are probably better advised to skip it. Polselli is probably best known for his 1972 Giallo \"Delirio Caldo\", whereas this film remains relatively obscure. This is understandable, since the weirdness, confusion and lack of logic presented in \"The Reincarnation of Isabel\" simply cannot appeal to everybody. Nonetheless, this film is recommendable to my fellow Italo-Horror buffs as a particularly bizarre and unusual production. The plot centers around a witch burning in the 14th century, when Isabel (played by the stunning Rita Calderoni) is accused of witchcraft and burned; centuries later, people who seem to be (reincarnations of?) the accusers and the accused gather at a party in an old castle, and mysterious events begin to occur... or something. The films wonderful visual style and elegant presentation of sleaze almost make it forgivable that the plot is utterly confusing and lacking any structure whatsoever. Visually, Polselli's film ranks only slightly below the works of masters such as Mario Bava and Antonio Margheriti - and this is a comparison I do not make frivolously. The cinematography is gorgeous, as are the ravishing actresses (Rita Calderoni above all). The film is as wonderfully sleazy as it may be expected from an Italian Occult Horror / Exploitation flick from the early 70s, and neither does it scant with the gore. However, there is simply no coherent storyline, but simply a collection of elegant, sleazy sequences attached to one another by a thin yet confusing plot. Apart from Rita Calderoni and a bunch of other beauties in the female cast, the film stars bodybuilder Mickey Hargitay. Once the husband of Jayne Mansfield, Hargitay spent most of his acting career in Italian Cult productions, including director Polselli's own \"Delirio Caldo\", \"La Figlia Di Frankenstein\" (\"Lady Frankenstein\", 1971) and the unintentionally hilarious \"Il Boia Scarlatto\" (\"The Crimson Executionner\", 1964). \"The Reincarnation of Isabel\" is, simply put, weird, weird, WEIRD, and while some people (myself included) will have a great time watching it, others will roll their eyes. Personally, I enjoyed the film; however, the film's plotlessness manifested in my drink consumption while watching it - when the film began, I opened a beer which I thought was the only one I'd drink that night, but once the film was over I was drinking my fifth.",
         "Most people that see this film use the word 'nonsense' to describe it and it's not hard to see why. The Reincarnation of Isabel utilises the age-old horror plot line of a witch being brought back to life; but unlike other films of it's ilk, this one jumps straight in at the reincarnation stage; thus forsaking any explanation as to why the witch was exterminated, and why there are people that want to bring her back. These things are explained somewhat a bit later on; and it's these scenes of 'explanation' that really highlight this film's problem. It's practically impossible to differentiate the flashback sequences from the main action, and if it wasn't for the fact that the woman about to be burnt at the stake was called Isabel, the audience would be none the wiser as to what is actually going on. The film features many scenes that appear to be completely random - some of them may be flashbacks explaining the story, I don't know! However, one thing that I do know is that this isn't a story based film - and when it comes to pure Eurotrash, this film excels! The film features a very gritty European style, and every scene looks great. The lighting is superb, with several sequences seemingly existing only so the director can show off his impressive lighting techniques. The score is suitably creepy, and this is flanked by some excellent set design. The scenes involving the black magic rites themselves are particularly great because they seem to exist in dreamscape. These scenes look fabulous, and even though they're not making much sense, they still allow the film some credibility. No Eurotrash flick would be complete without gore and nudity, and this film features plenty of both. Beautiful girls wearing little or nothing are plentiful, and the gore tends to be of the 'realistic' kind, meaning that it's not gratuitous; but it looks real, and is all the more shocking for that. The film runs at almost 100 minutes, which is a bit on the long side considering it doesn't really have a plot to speak of. I recommend this film to anyone who likes films to look nice. If you're someone that sees a coherent plot as an essential element for a successful horror movie, then there's a good chance that The Reincarnation of Isabel is not your thing.",
         "This movie makes no sense (like most Italian horror films I've seen), but has enough sleazy nudity, blood and weirdness going on that it doesn't really matter. What made the film work for me was the haunting, erotic soundtrack! I liked this about as much as the similarly ridiculous NUDE FOR SATAN (also from Redemption/Image). Worth a rental if you enjoy this type of nonsense, but I can't see anyone buying the disk and watching it more than once."
