         "I have previously seen Kassandra in Il Guardino and now actually saw her in Cleopatra (showing during one of my trips to Europe on the plane!), this time there was no Italian dialogue just movement and a face. Did I ever imagine Kassandra as Cleopatra.... well who wouldn't especially after seeing her in Ricky Nelson as Cleopatra (yes .... again). GREAT.... GREAT.... loved it and I am so looking forward to see her again in some bigger parts. I actually had the chance to meet her personally at \"Il Guardino\" Premiere and she was so genuine and a true beauty, no harsh attitude, no prima dona just Kassandra Marr. I hope she stays that way and will be following closely her future endeavors as, I believe she is a star in the makings. A great STAR.",
         "During the Roman occupation of Egypt a tidal wave swept away portions of Alexandria. Cleopatra was the last of the Ptolemy dynasty to rule an Egypt free of Roman rule, and many of the buildings in use in Egypt under Cleopatra were still in use at the time of the tidal wave. These buildings included a palace near the harbor, believed to be used by Cleopatra herself. Underwater archaeologists are attempting to locate and map the portions of Alexandria which the tidal wave took into the sea, particularly Cleopatra's palace. This documentary tells the story of that search in the murky harbor, and uses reenactors to put the archaeological discoveries in perspective. My rating of \"5\" is intended to be a neutral rating in between the top and bottom. This documentary is neither better or worse than a standard television documentary of this type, and people with a particular interest in Cleopatra, archeology, or scuba diving might find it interesting."
