         "The acting is terrible, the choreography and fight scenes are abysmal, and the plot, if you can even call it that does not hold attention at all. This films just screams low budget, with poorly trained actors and mediocre (at best) martial artists. It almost reminds me of Arena as it has many similarities, but worse, much much worse if you can believe that. Ultimately it is not worth your time, not to buy or rent, you couldn't give it away without offending the other person. Stay away at all costs, trust me. You're best watching an actual good fighting film such as; Undisputed 2, blood sport, IP man and the like.",
         "i don't know why guys said it was bad acting and bad fight scenes. what were they watching? the acting was OK and story was OK for a low budget movie but the fight scenes were very good. i watched almost every martial arts films that came out and these guys can fight. these guys were trained from shaolin so i don't know why guys wrote that it had bad fight scenes. there were some plot holes, but what movie doesn't? but most importantly the fight scenes, which why u watch these kinds of movies for, made up for any shortcomings. i hope these guys make more movies and for the haters, i don't know what u were watching or have against these guys.",
         "I'm a big fan of martial arts movies and i think nowadays it's quite difficult to find a movie with legible fight scenes and an interesting scenario that make you watch the whole movie. Die Fighting is one of those that keep you on your seat until the end cause it's not only about the martial arts but also about something real,human,that could have happen, not some vendetta crap like we often see those days. I think the idea of the plot was quite imaginative and genuine. About the martial arts,the choreography was amazing,Wushu style(Chinese martial arts)the directing was great with actual shots where you can see the actors are real martial artists,(like The Raid)i think this movie was made with brio",
         "The film revolves around a band of actors who wish to become major action stars, when one day the lead Fabian gets a mysterious phone call saying that his wife has been kidnapped and the four friends must follow all directions from the mystery man on the phone. The actors soon learn that they are part of a film and they must use their martial arts skills to take on all comers or Fabian's wife will be killed�. It's a low budget but despite that the story is very entertaining for a martial movie, some acting part could have been better but the most important film part of any martial arts movie is whether the fight scenes are good or not and they are truly amazing, all scenes are beautifully choreographed. This is the most enjoyable martial arts movie that I have seen, since the raid. For all fans of martial arts films Die Fighting is definitely one to see.",
         "For all the direct to DVD action movies that usually hit the bargain bin their are a few hidden gems among them. Die Fighting would definitely rank up their as one of the better titles that are a part of the genre. Fabien Garcia is definitely a name to look out for in the future for the genre. The movie provides on a wall-to-wall succession of impressively shot and choreographed fight sequences that are sure to provide thrills. Of course the acting may not be the greatest, but the main actors do perform their own stunts and combat sequences which surely earn them respect for action fans. The story may remind you of another solid martial arts action movie BKO: Bangkok Knockout, but they do add a twist in their to make it more unique and fact that the story and characters pretty much mirror the real life of the actors makes it more interesting to watch. Overall, a must watch for fans of movies like Undisputed II and III, Ninja II and other Direct to DVD/video action titles. If your one of those guys who enjoys these types of films, than sit back and enjoy the action and don't think too much. 6/10",
         "I really loved DIE FIGHTING. This movie highlights the awesome fighting and choreography skills of Z TEAM. The action is non-stop, and the fights deliver powerful, acrobatic punches, kicks, elbows, and knees that you feel right down to the bone. No extreme close-ups or \"shakey-cam\" to cover bad choreography. Just great action! The plot is simple enough to follow, but the twists are exciting and keep the characters motivated to the end. It reminded me of THE RAID and UNDISPUTED 3. The fights are some of the best Hong Kong style fights I've seen. The skills of the fighters are amazing, and each has a unique style, which is refreshing. The editing was sharp, and the soundtrack was very nice. I would definitely recommend this movie to action fans. Check it out today!",
         "When you prepare yourself to watch a low budget action film, you can expect there's going to be a certain amount of gratuitous violence executed in a style that might be considered passable at best. But Fabien, Lohan, and their \"Z Team\" deliver spectacular balls-out choreography, brilliantly executed, at par or better than most big budget feature films. And much like any Jackie Chan film, story isn't really that important, but this is actually a fairly cool premise with a satisfying twist. Keep an eye on these guys. I'm sure we'll be seeing them again soon. That is if they don't beat the crap out of each other first.",
         "The fighting alone makes it worth the 6/10. The acting was hard to watch.. The story was nothing worse than what you'd find in other martial arts movies like Ong Bak, etc. The movie has A LOT of fighting in it, and thankfully you don't have to sit through to much of the painful acting. The majority of the fights are really well done (especially those with the lead actor). The fighters themselves can seriously fight. They have technique and speed that I've seen from more famous actor/fighters (Tony Jaa, Iko Uwais). The lead actor is especially fun to watch. If you're a martial arts fanatic like myself, you'll really appreciate the skill that he has. It's a shame these guys don't have a bigger budget to work with or may never getting the fame and reputation of guys like Tony Jaa but I truly believe they have the same level of skill as the famous guys. I really hope to see more of these guys in more professional shot/ editing movies.",
         "I wouldn't get near giving this a 10 .. but i also wouldn't call it the worst Martial Arts movie that i have ever seen (and I've seen a bunch). Since the main listed actor did the directing etc too, I'm guessing this was a project of passion, but the dude sure has a mean kick. Low budget obviously, and a pretty weak plot and average acting, but still worth a watch for the fight Choreography. I didn't think that i would make it thru the whole movie but i did . Filmed with multiple cameras, most simulating some kind of CCTV cameras which is an interesting choice.. seems to work with the plot. So yeah .. worth at least one watch, but don't look for many Oscars in its future. EDIT: When i wrote this i wasn't quite finished with the movie.. now that i am .. the ending actually caught me off guard.. it was very well done.",
         "Alright, so I heard about this movie on Martialartsmoviejunkie, and being in a fighting-movie kind of mood, I checked it out. Lets get down to it. The fighting is pretty good. Good choreography, and pretty well shot. (no shaky cam thank god) The action is over all not bad. Although the shoot-out scene drags on and suffers from low budget. Bullet penetrate just one side of cardboard boxes? Really? Come on. What is not good though, is the acting. The drama. Oh god, the drama. First off, 3 of the 4 main actors are not really American, but speak English none the less. Broken English, that is. And they can't really act that good, it's not horrible, but it's in no way good enough. At least not good enough to have dramatic scenes with crying and stuff. The movie is just good enough for me to watch it to the end, and SPOILER the ending is kind of a not too bad twist that I didn't see coming. If you really love fighting movies, this is alright. But there are plenty others to see before this one."
