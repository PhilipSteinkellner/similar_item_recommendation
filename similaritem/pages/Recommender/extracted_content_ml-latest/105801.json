A bunch of wonderful characters and cast, this is somewhat entertaining. Takes place in the backdrop of Disneyland, Florida. Focused on a small family with two little kids having a nice time in the theme park. The story centres mainly on the father, who unable to resist the attraction towards two young French girls seen everywhere he goes. Which leads him to make mistakes being a father. Moreover, strange and unrecognisable events jeopardises the unity of his family.\r\n\r\nA bit of fantasy and reality, the film has a style. I thought it was just a flow that's taking it to the other end of the film, but the twist caught me by surprise. Nothing like a mind blowing, but for this kind of small flick, it was good enough. I don't think in any way the film offends the Disney park and Disney fans. Though the Disney did a fine job ignoring it rather than creating more publicity for the film by suing. It was just a possibility of life event which can take place anywhere, anytime. So, that's how it came into the life with this children's favourite theme park. Despite where it sets in, the film is for the adults. I think it is worth a try without any expectation.\r\n\r\n_6/10_",

         "My high review of this will likely make it stand out (and possibly not in the best way), but hear me out- this movie is the punk rock of cinema right now. It simply doesn't care. It's dark, twisted, hilarious, unnerving, and very Terry Gilliam. This isn't a movie to be looked in very deeply (as admittedly the symbolism is a bit confused and the plot takes a very strange turn), but it's fascinating, strange, and incredibly entertaining. It's certainly not a movie one will forget about quickly. It breaks the basic rules of film and never comes off as pretentious- it pokes fun at itself, and not in an annoying way. It's strange and fantastic. Recommended in general, but highly recommended to film buffs and fans of the bizarre. Definitely worth a watch.",
         "While this may not exactly be Heaven's Gate, Escape From Tomorrow is a case of the film's production being far more interesting than the film itself. Surreptitiously shot at Disneyland without any permission at all, this film can still earn its title of ultimate guerrilla film based on that fact alone. However, the most interesting factor is that not only do Disney now know about it, but they're not doing anything about it. Evidently it's not worth the effort but boy is is that a hook beyond the film's context itself. Everyone loved the idea of this film. It's a great juxtaposition, a surreal David Lynch/Terry Gilliam-esque nightmare in Disneyland. Unfortunately the films we concocted out of our imaginations are much better than the material Moore thought about. This is the work of an eager amateur. Contrary to expectation, Escape From Tomorrow has an incredibly mild execution, focusing on cheap gags and slapstick rather than scares or atmosphere (black and white film is not atmosphere). Granted, I'm sure Moore had a lot of challenges and maybe the film doesn't match his initial vision, but the scenes away from the parks match the weirdly off tone so maybe this is who he is. The photography is only okay. The technical aspects do suffer, particularly with sound and visual effects in green screening, but that's forgivable given the circumstance but not forgivable given the script. The fundamental problem is that the acting is very unconvincing. Instead of a protagonist undergoing an understandable mid-life crisis, he ends up like Lester Burnham without the charm, acting just like a terribly unlikeable 16 year old pervert. And this guy is supposed to be a parent. Perhaps Moore wants us to be uncomfortable watching him, maybe there's things to be said about man's desire for young women, but it's not the kind of meaningful discomfort that really makes a viewer think, it feels thrown in there as a character quirk. It's hard not to go into these types of films without expectations, but it simply didn't go as dark as I would've wanted and ended up feeling random instead with too many plot threads. The film could've saved itself by its final minutes by tying up all of them in an interesting way that actually says something, but instead they vouch for a single one that negates the others. It can be interesting and engaging at times, but as a whole it doesn't really work since Moore doesn't have anything to say about the human psyche, just that this would probably be cool if a film shot in Disneyland about bad things happening existed. Please make this a curiosity viewing only and don't get too excited. 5/10",
         "The infamous film that was shot almost entirely at Disneyworld. The thought was, when it opened at Sundance in January, that Disney would sue it out of existence, that maybe you'd only ever be able to see it if it popped up online at some point. In the end, though, Disney just decided to ignore it (some have pointed out that the company's infamous litigiousness is more a thing of the past). So the next question has to be, does this actually work as a film, or is it just a curio? In my opinion, it very much is a curio, but not just because of the circumstances of its production. It is, in fact, an extremely weird film. It's far from perfect, but, really, it's so weirdly entertaining that I don't really care. The one thing I really love about it is the black and white cinematography - it's really gorgeous and eerie. The film has a hypnotic quality. It's well worth checking out.",
         "Here's the thing. Yes this movie is getting a lot of press from filming in Disneyland without \"their\" consent, but it's still a good movie. It's an interesting journey of one mans perversions. Are they real? Are they in his head? The filmmaker explores these issues in a way that keeps your attention. My thoughts are- it could have been filmed in your local park. Where or how it was filmed, isn't the point. The story, direction, and actors is what makes it worth your while! The fact that a small independent film is getting a major theatrical release is important in the current state of the film business. This film gives hope to the up and coming filmmakers who have a good story, vision, and collaboration with production members, that you can still do it on your own.",
         "My first thought was what the *beep* did I just watch? It was however, a very interesting, well made film that, to me anyways, didn't make much sense. At times hilarious, genuinely frightening, surreal, and creepy, this black and white film seems to tell some sort of message about Disneyworld, though I'll be damned if I know what it is. That's all I'll say about the movie, which in fact takes place in Disneyworld in it's entirety. If David Lynch and Terry Gilliam had a baby, and that baby grew up in an insane asylum watching Disney movies day in and day out, this is the film I would expect that individual to eventually write and direct. I'd also like to add that the movie had nothing to do with pedophilia, as at least one other review suggests. The topic isn't even touched on. I wasn't bored for a minute and I would definitely recommend this one to any fans of fantasy/horror. 8/10.",
         "I didn't expect to walk out of this movie praising it in any way, however the way it was filmed was intriguing to me and the fact that it was controversial enough to get a rise out of the Disney Corporation. However, after seeing this film my mind was racked with different themes and metaphors portrayed in this film. It's actually really good. Even with its occasional flaws, Escape from Tomorrow is one of the better amateur films I have seen in recent years. It deserves praise. It's well thought out and shows the dark side of a corporation like Disney as well as the dark side of an average man's dreams. I say its defiantly worth a watch.",
         "Just as a preface, I'm a huge fan of Disney World, I've gone there multiple times and I appreciate and love nearly everything about it. From the atmosphere, the technology, and just the overall experience, I find it to be a wonderful place. Anyways, for those who don't know, this was a movie entirely shot inï¿½Disney World/Land which that alone is absolutely mind blowing. The movie could have been complete crap and it still would have been interesting but it was still an actual decent movie regardless of plenty of muddled plot/symbolism stuff that doesn't entirely make sense. It is the last day of Jim White's (Roy Abramsohn) vacation at Walt Disney World with his wife (Elena Schuber) and two children (Katelynn Rodriguez and Jack Dalton), he wakes up to find out he has been fired from his job. He keeps the news to himself and just wants to enjoy his last day at the Magic Kingdom with his family. We quickly come to realize that Jim is a bit of a pervert, he is obsessive about following two teenage girls (Annet Mahendru and Danielle Safady) throughout the day. And remember, this entire thing is shot in the Magic Kingdom. People are there. Real people. Not extras, nothing of that sort. Each shot I just keep thinking to myself, \"How?\" How did they manage this? How did nobody realize it? It's absolutely insane. Jim constantly sees images of horrifying images on It's A Small World, Winnie the Pooh, etc, etc. As the viewer, we have no idea what is real or what is in his head. The movie constantly has images of confusion. We, for ourselves, have to ask what is real. The special effects aren't that great but I give the movie the benefit of the doubt. It's a low budget movie, again, SHOT IN Disney WORLD. That alone makes this movie a significant feat. The last 30 minutes will make your head explode from wondering what is actually going on, the insanity of the entire movie, and just questioning the fact that this movie exists. The movie has plenty of things that just don't make sense. But, then again, I don't care. Again, I give this movie way too much of the benefit of the doubt but I can't help but not. It deserves it just because of how insane the last 30 minutes really are. Also, Jim is having a mental breakdown which only really helps make the movie slightly more substantial in it's confusion because we have to guess as to what is actually real. The last 30 minutes are truly like a strange, insane, David Lynch movie or something of that measure in it's pure weirdness. This movie is something that everyone should watch, it's risky in nearly every way and I'm glad to see that Disney didn't sue them. Sure, the movie had moments of bad acting, special effects, etc. (but, it's surprisingly well-shot for the most part), it doesn't matter though because of how wonderful this movie is in terms of experimentation. I may have some bias, I will admit. As a huge fan of Disney World, I loved it. I wouldn't be surprised if some people were offended by it if they were huge Disney fans but I wasn't really in anyway. It wasn't really offensive and more satirical essentially. Poking fun at. But, seeing all the rides and the park on screen in this weird, slightly psychotic, and horrific way made me laugh/enjoy the hell out of it. Overall, it has it's problems of bad special effects, acting, plot/symbolism that doesn't entirely make sense but EVERYONE should see this to actually believe it's even real.",
         "The idea of a man finding out he's been laid off or fired on the last day of his vacation, then suffering a mental breakdown has an interesting appeal. However, the plot was uneven (some mental breakdown, some interest in way-to-young women, some random interludes with older women). The guerrilla filming was great, but the story of mental breakdown could have (should have) been better, instead of being a random set of stories of a degenerate man who isn't faithful, and puts his needs above his family's. Based on descriptions, I expected a story about mental breakdown due to stress, but instead, it's more about the guerrilla filming style. He should have spent more time on the script.",
         "Look, it's a bit of a journey but when you really get this movie, it's troubling. 1st off this movie is unnerving in a way I haven't seen in quite some time simply for being sheerly strange. Like, I though of David Lynch a lot while viewing this and simply, it is a portrait of what it's like to go to these parks as an adult. I went to Disney last summer as an adult and lemme tell you...every family is like this. Dad = pervert sleaze Mom = Nag Kids = stupid. Straightforward as that. Now addressing the cat flu thing, this kinda stuff happens there. People bring all sorts of weird diseases to that place. As far as I can tell, this movie paints a picture of what it's like to be there. What it's like to see this world of creativity and fun from the outside. From the lenses of a hand-held. Why is this movie good? Because it's right. Then, the next guest arrives for their week in Hell.",
         "Based on the published storyline I was expecting a low-budget, home-move style, shallow Disney-bashing with perv undertones. Not so. Though set in the empire of the mouse, the tale goes beyond the familiar fantasy world, drawing us in and submerging us in an anxiety ridden, nightmarish landscape where reality and fantasy merge. Black and white alienates us from childlike enjoyment and reminded me of what Lon Chaney said about the face of a clown in the moonlight. We realize that without familiar touchstones of reality our imagination, once adrift from the safe moorings of our everyday life, is easily guided and can become lost. As our hero and the storyline begin to spin out of control your only thought is 'What the ....!?' Ultimately, once you have visited and so been transformed you will wonder if you ever leave."
