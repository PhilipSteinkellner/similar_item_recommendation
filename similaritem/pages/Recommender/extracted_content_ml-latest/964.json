            "content": "What about the Bible? You can't throw it away, that would be bad luck.\r\n\r\nAngel and the Badman is written and directed by James Edward Grant. It stars John Wayne, Gail Russell, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Irene Rich, Lee Dixon and Stephen Grant. Music is by Richard Hageman and cinematography by Archie J. Stout.\r\n\r\nQuirt Evans (Wayne), a notorious gunman is hurt and on the run. Taken in by The Worth's, a Quaker family, Quirt forms a \"special\" bond with daughter Penelope (Russell). With the law and other badmen on his tail, will Quirt change his ways before it's too late? \r\n\r\nJohn Wayne's first film as a producer and star is also his most romantic. That's not to say it lacks action or Wayne's fine tuning of his macho image is halted, because that's not the case, but this carries a dreamy like old fashioned value that has helped the film endear over the years. It's a touch too slow at times for its own good and runs for ten minutes longer than was needed, things that no doubt stunted its financial growth at the 1947 box office, but there is much to enjoy here.\r\n\r\nTechnical values are high, from Stout's photography that beautifully realises locations in Sedona, Arizona (Monument Valley standing out, naturally!), to cast performances from Carey, Wayne and the gorgeous Miss Russell (chemistry unbound between the three actors), film never lacks for quality. Memorable scenes are plenty, such as The Duke sitting in a chair facing down three henchmen led by Cabot's Laredo Stevens; his gun empty, a free-for-all punch up in a saloon, and some very tender moments between Wayne and Russell. While narratively there's the deft pitching of Quaker values into a wild west setting.\r\n\r\nA lovely film which also manages to pump the adrenaline as well. 7.5/10\r\n\r\nDVD version viewed was Region 2 taken out of the John Wayne Out West 6 film Box Set. A good quality black and white print.",

            "content": "RELEASED IN 1947 and written & directed by James Edward Grant, \u201cAngel and the Badman\u201d is a Western starring John Wayne as a gunslinger in Arizona who finds temporary sanctuary with some pacifistic Quakers. And maybe love too with the beautiful daughter (Gail Russell). Bruce Cabot plays the gunman\u2019s nemesis while Harry Carey plays the aged-but-still-formidable marshal. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s too bad that this was shot in B&W because the locations are spectacular. Wayne was facing his 40th birthday when this was filmed, which is funny because the daughter\u2019s mother (Irene Rich) keeps referring to how \u201cyoung\u201d he is. In any case, John was lean and relatively youthful-looking. On the other side of the spectrum, Gail is utterly stunning with her captivating eyes. Speaking of the feminine cast, saloon girls Joan Barton and Rosemary Bertrand are nothing to sneeze at. \r\n\r\nOne problem is that the romance is too blatant and develops way too quickly. But there are a few praiseworthy action sequences. One notable scene involves a couple in a wagon going off a cliff into a body of water. \r\n\r\nThe subtext relays three philosophies on violence: (1.) living it as a lifestyle, (2.) resorting to violence only when justifiable and more peaceful ways have been attempted or (3.) relying completely on nonviolent methods. Needless to say, the middle position is the best one and is, in fact, what the New Testament supports.                 \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 1 hours & 40 minutes and was shot entirely in Arizona (Sedona, Monument Valley & Flagstaff). \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-",

      "synopsis": "A man on horseback is being chased by gunmen who shoot at him. He outruns them, and races across gorgeous scenery in an arid landscape. Quirt Evans (John Wayne) falls from his faltering horse. A beautiful girl Penelope Worth (Gail Russell) and her father Thomas Worth (John Halloran) see him fall and approach to rescue him, as he is wounded. Before accepting attention to his wound, Quirt insists on going to the telegraph office, where he sends a telegram to claim some land and have it recorded in his name. When he gives his name, the town telegrapher Bradley (Olin Howland) recognizes him as a notorious gunfighter. Quirt loses consciousness and falls into Penelope's arms. Penelope and her father take Quirt to their home and send for the doctor. Dr. Mangram (Tom Powers) gives Quirt laudanum to anesthetize him, but Quirt remains very restless while unconscious, until the father realizes he is instinctively reaching for his gun. After the gun is emptied of bullets, it is put in Quirt's hand and that relaxes him so the bullet is extracted and his wound is cleaned and bandaged. Dr.. Mangram is a pragmatic atheist who immediately recommends that the family should get Quirt out of their house, but the family refuses because it is their duty as Quakers to tend to the wounded man. Quirt sleeps in bed for two whole days. While Penelope watches over him, he talks in his sleep about gunfights and women, especially one named Lila. In the kitchen, Penelope asks her mother (Irene Rich) about how she met her father, and how they fell in love. When Quirt wakes, and hears a noise, he gropes for his gun, which is under the pillow and rises, gun in hand to face a startled Penelope. Quirt's earlier lifestyle of fast draws, fast women, booze, bar fights, and so on doesn't bother the family as they believe there is good that can be nurtured in every person. Quirt gets stronger and relishes the mother's sausages, eggs, donuts and cakes that melt in your mouth. In town, telegrapher Bradley brags about having a long friendship with Quirt, because Quirt is notorious and feared by everyone in the territory, though he only saw him once when he sent off the telegram. Laredo Stevens (Bruce Cabot) and two henchmen, the gang who had shot Quirt a few days back, come looking for him, question Bradley, and eventually approach the Quaker home. When Quirt is aware of Laredo's presence outside the house, he jumps out of bed and dresses and gets his gun but it has no bullets, as Mr. Worth had emptied it. Talking tough, he bluffs, holding the gang off with his unloaded gun. Laredo wants the land Quirt had secured, and Quirt agrees to sell for twenty thousand dollars and signs a deed. Laredo hands over five thousand, promising to give the rest of the money later when Quirt comes over to collect. Quirt is respectful of the Quaker family's ways, he hangs his holstered gun outside, never allowing it inside. Exposure to the ways of the Quakers starts to change not only gunfighter Quirt but also the cynical, atheistic doctor who attends to him, grumbling all the time. When Quirt is able, he helps the family in their farm work, and is very grateful for their loving care. For Penelope, it has been virtually love at first sight. Quirt develops feelings for her as they chat about each other, farm work, and Quaker beliefs. In little time, Quirt kisses her, and she reacts ecstatically. They are interrupted by territorial Marshal Wistful McClintock (Harry Carey) who questions Quirt about his recent whereabouts. Penelope's statement that he hasn't been outside the farm for days is totally believed, but the marshal warns about his habits and promises he will be watching closely. Quirts romantic feelings can't help but increase. At one point Penelope confesses her love for Quirt, and is surprised he doesn't feel the same: \"I never thought it could happen to one and not another.\" Her outright innocence is incredibly touching and endearing, and affects Quirt deeply. Quirt doesn't want to let the love take over because of the life that he leads and because he will be out looking for revenge on the people who shot him. The tug of his old ways is still strong. Quirt's reputation as a gunslinger comes in very handy in settling a dispute with a neighbor who has diverted water that used to flow toward the Quaker settlement. Neighbor Frederick Carson (Paul Hurst) is convinced by Quirt by the power of his menacing reputation, to \"be a good neighbor\" and remove the top two boards holding back water that used to flow into flumes and irrigation ditches. Nevertheless it is the genuine and uncritical welcome the old man subsequently receives from the Worths that converts him from obnoxious neighbor into friend. As Carson is happily taking home a basket of pies and donuts from Mrs. Worth, he remarks to the as yet vacillating Quirt, about how good helping his neighbors makes him feel. As Quirt stays with the family longer, their life becomes more attractive to him. On the way to a surprise arranged for him at a [Quaker] meeting, Quirt is seen by the passing Randy McCall (Lee Dixon), who is an old friend and former partner in crime. Randy reverses course and goes along. At the meeting, the Quaker group thanks Quirt publicly for solving the water problem, and is given a Bible. Randy is impressed, then enthralled by the Bible given to Quirt, and takes to reading it out loud at any opportunity. During the gathering, the young and handsome local blacksmith approaches Penelope and his interest in courting and marrying her is obvious. Quirt becomes jealous but isn't ready to take responsibilities. Randy takes Quirt aside after the ceremony and tells him that he knows that Laredo is planning to rustle a large herd as it is driven through a nearby valley the next day. Quirt, overwhelmed by the Quakers' gratitude, and convinced that he isn't good for Penelope, takes the opportunity to get away and try a return to his old life. He takes the blacksmith aside and tells him to quit stalling and marry Penelope, and immediately departs with Randy. The Laredo gang's attempt to rustle the herd is foiled by Quirt and Randy and another friend. First there are galloping horses, guns blazing, falls from horses, and a stampede, as Laredo attacks, but then Quirts gang comes from behind and one by one picks off the rustlers by using long wooden clubs. Next we see Randy and Quirt drinking at a saloon and casino in Red Rock, where Lila (Joan Barton) is entertaining with her singing. Quirt is no longer the old Quirt. He gambles and wins a pile of chips that he gives to Lila as a goodbye present in honor of their old relationship. Then he picks a fight with a group drinking at the bar by rudely pushing them aside and yelling \"More Whiskey!\" to start a massive saloon brawl. He makes it back to the Worth farm and wants to resume with Penelope. McClintock is not convinced of his desire to reform. He remarks \"I'm patient, that's what hangs all you fellas in the end, I'm patient\", although his regard for Quirts reputation is almost respectful: \"You know Quirt, I always figured on usin' a new rope in hangin' you\". McClintock keeps dropping by to see Quirt and to interrogate him, reminding Quirt that he is going to enjoy hanging him and is waiting for a showdown with Laredo so that he can \"... hang the winner\". Later, when he takes Penelope on a buckboard wagon to pick blackberries, Quirt leaves his gun behind in deference to her wishes. The scene where the two pick blackberries is a romantic idyll, which ends abruptly when Laredo and his gang spot them from a distance and menacingly approach in galloping horses. Outnumbered, without a gun, and with Penelope at his side, there is no option but to run, and there follows a thrilling chase of a wagon on a road being pursued by men on horseback. Quirt maneuvers and takes jumps and steep and narrow paths, one man collides with a tree branch, but eventually his wagon runs off a ledge and falls from a great height into a deep narrow river. Quirt manages to swim to hide below the rocks, pulling an unconscious Penelope with him. Laredo looks upon the scene from a height a few moments later, and assumes Quirt has drowned. Later, Quirt walks into the Worth farm carrying the unconscious Penelope in his arms, and the doctor is called. The prognosis is bad, the skeptical doctor takes up his sermonizing as to how dangerous Quirt is to those around him, and how frustrating his profession is, that he works to patch up people who keep on doing dangerous things and being hurt again and again. Quirt, who believes he is losing the great love of his life, wants revenge, and goes into town to face Laredo when he is told Laredo is in the saloon. He enters one end of town, walking alone, the townspeople scatter. Laredo is shocked to be told Quirt is at the other end of town, inviting him to come out. First he sends one of his henchmen to peek out to verify. Then, he decides to take another swig of a whisky bottle, and waits. Meantime, Penelope has recovered consciousness, and, weak as she is, demands to be driven to town in the wagon, lying down. The Worth wagon arrives on the scene. Penelope insists on trying to talk Quirt out of violence. Quirt turns his back to the saloon to talk to her, just as Laredo emerges. In part to protect Penelope who would be in the line of fire, Quirt drops his gun and turns to face Laredo weaponless. It might have been a sad finale, were it not for the vigilant McClintock, who has his rifle pointed at Laredo from a distance, and shoots as he sees Laredo reach for his gun. So the bad guys die by causes that are natural to them, namely bullets, but Quirt doesn't do the shooting. As Quirt departs on his way home with the Worths, the Marshal picks up Quirt's gun and announces he will hang it in his office along with a new rope, in memory of the adversary who never was.",

         "A man on horseback races across the arid landscape. His horse faulters and throws the man. This is how The Angel and The Badman begins. Wayne is Quirt Evans, a man with a past. He is rescued by beautiful Gail Russell, a Quaker girl with a strong, silent father and a marvelous, generous mother who makes donuts and cakes that melt in your mouth, but according to her are, \"not very good, the flour you know...\". Poor Quirt never has a chance. He is healed body and soul by this devoted family. But not before he must taste his old way of life one more time, which leads to a dramatic conclusion. John Wayne never looked better on film then in The Angel and The Badman. In one scene, he wakes from a coma, hears a noise, gropes for his gun, which is under the pillow and rises, gun in hand to face a startled and stunning Russell. The sight of John Wayne, shirtless, his hair un-combed and his gorgeous, almost purple eyes taking in the lovely lady in front of him, is something no woman from 6 to 106 should miss. If you are a fan already and have seen this delightful film, you know what I mean. If you are new to John Wayne, check to one out and fall in love. Harry Carey plays the Marshal of the territory who keeps track of Quirt, not completely convinced of his conversion, until the surprising climax. Carey's quiet authority is wonderful to watch, and his sly humor a tonic. The Dr. here over-plays his role, but he can be forgiven. The neighbor who has denied water to the Quaker settlement but is convinced by Quirt(without the force of his famous gun), to \"be a good neighbor\" and remove the top two boards holding back the water that used to flow into flums and irrigation ditches, is a real old west character. Films today just don't use actors with faces like his any longer. Too bad. Yes indeed, The Angel and The Badman is a wonderful, old fashioned film. The kind they don't make any longer, but should.",
         "ANGEL AND THE BADMAN is a film that many John wayne fans may not have seen; nonetheless it's one of his best that shows a very different side. Wayne as Quirt Evans is wounded and taken in by a gentle Quaker family. After he recuperates he notices their daughter--the absolutely drop dead gorgeous Gail Russell. The plot of AATBM is remarkably similar to Harrison Ford's WITNESS (probably a remake). But what ultimately makes this movie work is Wayne's performance, and Russell's natural \"Angelic\" qualities. The camera really loves her. There's one scene where she confesses' her love for Wayne, and is surprised he doesn't feel quite the same: \"I never thought it could happen to one and not another.\" Her outright innocence in this scene is incredibly touching, and endearing, and you see how this affects Wayne in the same way.",
         "Fun movie about a cowboy named Quirt (John Wayne) who is wants to reform his ways after he meets a sweet Quaker girl. When he is shot, the Quaker family takes care of him, and after he wakes up the daughter (Gail Russell) falls in love with him. It's goofy and cliché, sure, but there's a really fine movie to be found in the familiar setup. Writer/director Grant create many good vignettes. There are several wonderful supporting characters who add a lot of worth to the proceedings, including Harry Carey as a marshall, Lee Dixon as one of Quirt's friends and old partners in crime, Tom Powers as the local, scientific, atheist doctor, and Olin Howlin as the town telegrapher. Howlin's character is pure comic relief, very humorously claiming a long friendship with Quirt, though he only saw him once when he was almost unconscious. Then Carey's character is wryly comedic: as the marshall, he's constantly stalking Quirt. He's sure that someday he'll get to hang the guy, and he harps on it constantly. The chemistry between Wayne and Russell adds an unexpected poignancy to the film. The scene where the two pick blackberries is simply beautiful, and their wordless climactic exchange is perfectly performed. Good action sequences, as well. 9/10.",
         "The Angel and the Badman is a milestone film in the career of John Wayne. It was the first film in which he had a substantial role behind the camera. My guess is that he must have lobbied Herbert J. Yates at Republic films for some creative control and Yates gave in to his studio's biggest moneymaker. Though Wayne at times didn't have the best judgment in regard to his own personal projects, The Angel and the Badman is a winner in every way and doesn't get near enough credit for the work it is except from Wayne partisans. Wayne plays young gun hand Quirt Evans, a most feared man in the territory, who wounded falls in the hands of a Quaker family who nurses him back to health. Wayne starts eying pretty daughter Gail Russell. Pretty soon under her influence Wayne starts questioning the direction his life's been going in. Of course the Quakers do cheat a little on this question themselves. Though they don't believe in violence, the Duke's reputation as a gun hand comes in mighty handy in settling at least one neighborly dispute with Paul Hurst. My favorite scene in the film and one of Wayne's best in all his films also involves his reputation. When Bruce Cabot and two henchmen find him at the Quaker home, Wayne runs one terrific bluff holding them off with an empty gun. This was the first time Wayne and Cabot worked together. In the sixties Cabot became a regular in Wayne films. Angel and the Badman also has two other Wayne attempted reclamation projects. Gail Russell was one of the most beautiful women ever on the silver screen. She had a lot of tragedy in her life and died young. Wayne at one point gave her the lead in a film Seven Men from Now that he was producing, but not starring in, with Randolph Scott. She gave a good performance, but a lot of substance abuse had taken its toll. Paul Hurst later on got a pay day from Wayne in Big Jim McLain in a scene he portrayed from a wheelchair. He was terminally ill with cancer and in fact took his own life shortly afterwards. The money was no doubt needed for Hurst's medical expenses. Later on in McLintock Wayne said in one scene he doesn't give jobs, he hires men (and women). This was his idea of charity and something that never gets talked about enough by people, even some of Wayne's most devoted fans. As this was his first film as producer, I have no doubt that the Duke wanted Harry Carey, the man he patterned his cowboy image after in this film. One of Carey's best screen performances as the \"patient\" federal marshal who's waiting for Cabot and Wayne to shoot it out so he can hang the winner. Wayne's good friend James Edward Grant wrote and directed the film. Later on Frank Capra disparaged Grant as a bad influence on Wayne when they quarreled during the filming of Circus World. Grant did write some of the more conservative on Wayne's films. But I certainly can't fault anything he did in The Angel and the Badman. In fact it's a winner in just about every respect. Even some Wayne haters might like this one.",
         "John Wayne got to kiss a score of pretty ladies on screen, but his romance with Gail Russell as Penelope, the \"Angel\" in this story, shows the best screen chemistry I can recall. Wayne is the \"Badman\" Quirt Evans meaning that he settles a lot of arguments with guns a'blazin'. He's used to fast draws, fast women, booze, bar fights, and so on. Penelope is a gentle Quaker woman living in the wilderness of the Old West. She and her parents model their lives on the teachings of scripture, especially the \"Love your neighbor\" ideal. Quirt gets shot in one of his many battles with gun wielding black hat bad guys; Penelope's family takes him in and nurses him back to health; during which time Quirt and Penelope get a look at each other with the obvious chemical reaction. Her sweet and vulnerable demeanor mixes splendidly with his gruff but awkwardly gentle persona. When Wayne's nemesis Laredo (Bruce Cabot) shows up, Wayne is faced with the conflict of adapting the peaceful ways of Penelope, or reverting to his violent shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later lifestyle. Wayne's inner conflict to change his outlook on life is illustrated well, a great performance for the Duke. This all goes on under the watchful eye of the Marshall (Harry Carey), who serves as not only a foil for Wayne constantly threatening him, but almost like a self-appointed guardian who sees Quirt's potential for good, trying to steer him toward the light. Carey's humor, and good spirit plays off Wayne perfectly. The film builds to a brilliant finish, with Quirt forced to choose between peace or violence once and for all. One of my favorite westerns. Great cast, great story.",
         "One of my all-time favorite movies and, in my opinion, one of the Duke's best. This one's got it all...comedy, drama, and redemption. Both the Duke and Gail Russell give fine lead performances supported by a colorful cast of characters. I highly recommend this movie to all.",
         "Angel and the Badman has always been a favorite movie to me. Angel contains humor and drama, action and romance. The movie can be enjoyed by anybody regardless of age or gender. I have a well-worn VHS copy and wanted to acquire the movie on DVD and enjoy DVDs superb quality. Now, after several months delay, Barns and Noble finally delivered a copy issued from the Roan Group. Unfortunately, this DVD does not meet with the DVD promise. What could be wrong with Angel and the Badman? The first thing I noticed was the soft image quality. The video lacks the high detail one expects from digital playback. The contrast range is compressed and requires fiddling with display controls to get almost acceptable brightness range. Another interesting and annoying issue is the constant blue and pink sparkle in and otherwise black and white image. The playback seems to jitter slightly as if the framing is not consistent. How could this be? When played back on a PC the answer becomes clear. At the top of the image the observant and knowledgeable viewer will spy the first line of scan beginning part way across the screen. This is an artifact of interlace scanning and indicates this DVD's video source originated from a VHS tape---not the original film print. This is a very sloppy conversion with apparently no attention to details important to creating a quality product such as captioning or alternate languages. Don't waste money on this DVD from the Roan Group---buy a VHS tape instead.",
         "This is one of Wayne's best movies, the simple but powerful story of a man changing for the love of a woman. It is always a great introduction to John Wayne for someone who has not appreciated his work, his best movies are about love and redemption. The Quiet Man, Stagecoach and The Angel and The Badman, are among the best movies ever made.",

Rare and enjoyable beauty , she was to be groomed one of Paramout's top stars , but the alcohol took her and she was found dead and it attributed to the drinking . Gail was only 36 years old . Had it not been for the alcohol , Gail's career could have been one of the biggest . Besides , there appears Harry Carey Sr. as a tough sheriff , Carey was a veteran actor who played numerous Western . The motion picture is finely directed by the Wayne's usual screenwriter named James Edward Grant . There's also a lousy version in computer-colored . The flick will appeal to John Wayne fans and Western moviegoers . Rating : Nice and well worth watching .",
         "John Wayne's performance was riveting as he portrayed \"bad guy\", \"good guy\" in sometimes the same scene. The movie was a joy to watch also for the fact that this definitely fit the John Wayne \"cowboy\" mold. The concluding scenes still left one wondering about the outcome."
