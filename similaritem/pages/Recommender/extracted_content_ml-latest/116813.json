         "\"The Brides of Fu Manchu\" is the second of five Fu Manchu movies produced by Harry Alan Towers and starring Christopher Lee.The film is definitely the most entertaining of all the Fu Manchu films.The production values are top notch and the film is well-directed and acted.This time Fu Manchu wants to conquer the world(\"In a few moments,the entire world will capitulate to me.This is the destiny of Fu Manchu.\"-Fu Manchu).Fu Manchu's new evil plan is to send explosive energy via sound waves to small receivers placed in various cities throughout the world.It's up to Nayland Smith(Douglas Wilmer)to stop him...Anyway I enjoyed this film and you should too,if you like British horror/crime cinema.All the actresses starring in it are beautiful,especially Tsai Chin,the evil daughter of Fu Manchu.Fu Manchu returns a year later in \"The Vengeance of Fu Manchu\"(1967).",
         "The second film in producer Harry Alan Towers' Fu Manchu series is the only one to be filmed entirely in England, and went before the cameras only one month after \"The Face of Fu Manchu\" premiered in the USA. This compact little thriller is harmed by some last-minute cost saving measures, made in response to the disappointing boxoffice returns of the first film. It was not filmed in cinemascope and was processed in eastmancolor, the cheaper cousin of technicolor. The resulting film is dark and actually ugly-looking at times; its predominant color is washed-out red. Choosing to emphasize the sexual aspects of his story, Towers arranged an international beauty contest to find the world's most beautiful women to play the title roles. The contest, held after the film was already finished, was a publicity ploy to generate interest in the film as it sat on the shelf for almost one year before release. The \"brides\" were actually actresses and models, cast through standard agencies and for their willingness to appear in nude scenes for the racier European version. A lesser film than \"Face\", \"Brides\" is still an acceptable diversion, especially considering the nosedive the series would take after this. It would be director Don Sharp's last film in the series, and his considerable contribution would become evident after his departure.",
         "Second entry in Fu Manchu-Christopher Lee series set in London and based on Sax Rohmer's characters . At the film there are action, adventures, thrills, sadism and atmospheric outdoors filmed in London . Produced , as always, in average budget by Harry Allan Towers and also written under pseudonym of Peter Breck .

The best installments were ¨Face of Fu Manchu(1965, Don Sharp)¨, and ¨Brides of Fu Manchu( 1966, Don Sharp)¨ , followed by the inferior ¨Vengeance of Fu Manchu (1967 by Jeremy Summers ) and most critics felt the outing ¨Blood of Fumanchu¨ was one of the weakest entries along with ¨The castle of Fu Manchu¨, both of them directed by Jess Frank with similar casting , plenty of stock-shots and a Z-series style. Rating : 5,5 , average .",
         "Evil Oriental mastermind Fu Manchu (CHRISTOPHER LEE) abducts ten beautiful girls from around the world whose fathers are distinguished scientists and engineers. He then forces them to construct a \"death ray\", which generates phenomenal energy through radio waves. First he uses his new weapon to destroy \"The Windsor Castle\", an ocean liner, which was carrying several VIP's in order to show the world the extent of the damage he could do unless his demands are met. His next intended target is London's \"St Paul's Cathedral\" where an international arms conference is to take place. Nayland Smith (DOUGLAS WILMER) must locate his arch enemy's new installation and destroy the weapon, but in such a way that the lives of the girls will not be threatened. THE BRIDES OF FU MANCHU was the first sequel to the popular FACE OF... (1965), which went into production at the legendary Bray studios (once the home of the Hammer horror factory) on 12 January 1966 while its predecessor had barely completed its run of the UK's cinemas. The film also came with a huge publicity stunt, in which Lee would travel around different countries in Europe and select ten suitable girls (not necessarily an actress) to be Fu Manchu's brides in the film. THE BRIDES OF FU MANCHU is in no way as stylish as its predecessor, but its not bad as sequels go with the James Bond style plot carrying a little more weight than any of its subsequent successors. Director Don Sharp was wisely retained in the director's chair along with Cinematographer Ernest Steward whose lighting did so much for the first film. Between them they still brilliantly recreate the period atmosphere of 1920's London giving it a Conan Doyleish edge. The main problem with the film is that the script places more emphasis on torture and sadism here (one of the faults in subsequent entries) like when Fu Manchu forces one of the girls (in a state of trance) to throw another into his snake pit so the light-heartedness of the original is gone. A more explicit version filmed for overseas audiences apparently exists and Douglas Wilmer who was very popular on British television at the time as Sherlock Holmes is a disappointing substitute for Nigel Green as Nayland Smith. In summary, though by no means a perfect film, The Brides Of Fu Manchu is still the last of the good Fu Manchu's. From this point on the series was to sadly degenerate into shambling nonsense with lacklustre scripts, lower budgets and poor overall execution.",
         "This is the sequel to 'The Face Of Fu Manchu'. Once again Harry Alan Towers is the writer/producer, Don Sharp is the director, and Christopher Lee plays the fiendish Dr Fu Manchu, criminal mastermind. Fu Manchu's arch enemy Nayland Smith is played this time around by Douglas Wilmer ('The Vampire Lovers'), replacing Nigel Green. I miss Green but Wilmer is pretty good and Lee is terrific as always. Smith's Watson-like sidekick Dr. Petrie is once again played by Howard Marion-Crawford, and Tsai Chin returns as Fu Manchu's evil daughter Lin Tang. Horror buffs will get a kick out of seeing Heinz Dracher ('Circus Of Fear') as Franz and Rupert Davies ('Witchfinder General') as Jules Merlin. Also keep an eye out for Burt \"Kato\" Kwouk as Fu Manchu's assistant Feno. The plot concerns Fu Manchu's development of a death ray with which he plans to dominate the world. He kidnaps beautiful girls from various countries who are the daughters of prominent scientists or politicians to force them to cooperate. But Nayland Smith (who is kind of Sherlock Holmes to Fu Manchu's Moriarty) is soon onto his scheme and it becomes a race against time to stop Fu Manchu from taking over the world. I always thought that Sax Rhomer's Fu Manchu was a terrific villain, but in these politically correct times it's unlikely we'll see him return to our movies screens. Even the recent comic adaptation 'The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen' left his character out. Lee makes a perfect Fu Manchu even if he is sometimes let down by a mundane script and budgetary limitations. 'The Brides Of Fu Manchu' is just as entertaining as 'The Face Of Fu Manchu', so if you enjoyed the first movie you'll have fun watching this one. There were three more movies in the series and it is generally thought that each was progressively worse than the last, so proceed with caution...",
         "Fu Manchu's up to his old tricks � he's trying to take over the world. This time he's kidnapped the daughters of several esteemed scientists to use as blackmail so their fathers will help him with his plans. He's constructing something akin to a laser that can destroy entire cities. As usual, Nayland Smith is hot on his trail. I believe I've seen all of the Christopher Lee Fu Manchu movies and this one, The Brides of Fu Manchu, is to me the best. What sets this Fu Manchu movie apart from the others, especially those made later on, is the lively direction, the competent editing, and a much more coherent story. I'm one of those who will often defend Jess Franco till I'm blue in the face, but I can't do that with his Fu Manchu movies. Compared to The Brides of Fu Manchu, Uncle Jess' Fu Manchu movies are almost unwatchable. If you don't believe me just take a look at The Castle of Fu Manchu. It's God awful! Getting back to this movie, another plus for The Brides of Fu Manchu is the seemingly always enjoyable Christopher Lee. Lee is solid and certainly had a knack for playing the baddie as good as anyone. He imbibes Fu Manchu with a real sense of evil. You get the feeling that he's a man capable of doing anything to anybody at anytime. The rest of the cast is good, but nothing to write home about. Although not terribly memorable, it was nice to see Carole Gray in another film. For someone new to the series, The Brides of Fu Manchu would seem to make a good place to start. It's not perfect, but it is entertaining. For what it's worth, I'll give it a 7/10.",
         "Sequel to \"The Face of Fu Manchu\", \"Brides...\" is even better if you look movies just to be entertained. It's the kind of silly, funny, absurd, kinky time capsule movie that never loses his charm. Of curse, plot holes and mistakes are a plenty (it's in the 20's but girls looks very 60's) but Lee's terrific performance and a good cast full of familiar faces (even Pink Panther's Cato is here!) helps to sustain interest. Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie are a later version of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, but Fu Manchu is the main character here, cruel, sadistic and totally evil, probably the best villain ever, sadly forgotten today due to his racial connotations. The franchise will continue on three more films, but \"Face...\" and \"Brides...\" (both directed by Don Sharp) are the real thing. By the way, the 5 films are available now in a box set released in Spain by Manga Films (region 2), but beware: the last 2 movies (by Jesus Franco) are in Spanish without subtitles.",
         "Shrewd, ruthless and fearsome Chinese criminal mastermind Fu Manchu (the impeccable Christopher Lee in peak villainous form) kidnaps the beautiful daughters of the world's leading scientists and demands that they help build him a lethal death ray or else he will kill all of the lovely ladies. It's up to Fu Manchu's cagey and stalwart longtime nemesis Scotland Yard Inspector Nayland Smith (nicely played by Douglas Wilmer) to stop him before it's too late. Ably directed by Don Sharp, with an absorbing and eventful script by Peter Welbeck, a constant brisk pace, crisp, lively color cinematography by Ernest Steward, several exciting and well-staged action scenes, a rousing, spirited score by Johnny Douglas, a reasonable amount of tension, an admirably serious tone (there are no cheesy one-lines or needless campy humor to get in the way of the story), and a stirring fiery conclusion, this picture overall really delivers the entertaining goods. Moreover, the solid acting from a sturdy cast helps matters a whole lot: Lee naturally excels as the deliciously wily and wicked Fu Manchu, Wilmer makes for a properly resolute Smith, plus there are sound supporting performances by Tsai Chin as Fu Mancho equally evil daughter Lin Tang, Marie Versini as feisty, fetching nurse Marie Lenz, Heinz Drache as hot-headed chemist Franz Baumer, Howard Marion-Crawford as Smith's competent partner Dr. Petrie, Rupert Davies as beleaguered scientist Jules Merlin, Kenneth Fortescue as the eager Sergeant Spicer, and Burt Kwouk (Cato in the \"Pink Panther\" movies) as Fu Mancho's loyal henchman Feno. A neat little flick.",
         "The diabolical Chinese architect of doom, Fu Manchu(Christopher Lee, imposing as ever) still carrying a devious desire to control mankind across the globe, has orchestrated a new plan to destroy the top military nations' generals and Commander-in-chiefs who are gathering together in London for a service dedication at St. Paul's church. Through a method using energy(..provided through the use of light, heat and power, transmitted by sound waves), Fu Manchu needs the cooperation and know-how of the top industrialists and scientists, and in getting that he kidnaps their wives and daughters(..they are the \"brides\" of the title), using hypnosis with his incredible mental powers, removing their will and in doing so can command them to do anything he so desires. Fu Manchu's arch nemesis and wily adversary, Scotland Yard Assistant Commissioner Sir Dennis Nayland Smith(Douglas Wilmer), along with pathologist Dr. Petrie(Howard Marion-Crawford;Smith's Dr. Watson, you could say)and Parisian Inspector Pierre Grimaldi(Roger Hanin), must discover his plans and stop him before the cunning mastermind is able to remove the great military leaders which help to keep our world's countries safe. The film has three basic settings. London where Fu Manchu has dacoit soldiers attempting to kidnap Marie Lentz(Marie Versini), the daughter of a great scientist needed to assist the madman in equipping his machines with the proper settings to bomb major cities. Marie's fiancé, German research chemist Franz Baumer(Heinz Drache), helps Smith and company in their efforts to find Fu Manchu's headquarters, buried underground in the foothills of a specific French mountainside. The film often shows the trapped women imprisoned in Fu Manchu's headquarters, and slave Abdul(Salmaan Peerzada)who plans to save them. A certain industrialist, Jules Merlin(Rupert Davies), is chosen for his expertise in building little wireless sets which enable Fu Manchu's henchman to set up their operations in small locations. The film shows Merlin's daughter Michel(Carole Gray)imprisoned which motivates him to do what Fu Manchu asks. When Marie is finally kidnapped in a well orchestrated siege in an opera house, she will coordinate an escape plan with Michel. Baumer will also infiltrate the headquarters posing as his fiancé's father. The film also has scenes in Paris where Merlin's business is centered. Marie doesn't know that her best friend, Nikki Sheldon(Harald Leipnitz)is actually working for Fu Manchu and assists in having her captured at the opera house. Fu Manchu's corrupt organization is under the disguise of Wireless International. Showing his capabilities, Fu Manchu destroys a cruise ship, The Windsor Castle, which will prompt Smith to move faster in stopping him before he's able to carry out his ultimate plan. Using Marie's father, Otto Lentz(Joseph Fürst)expertise, they will hatch a plan to use a stronger signal to counteract Manchu's with the lives of many important figures' lying in the balance. Plot-heavy, exciting, fast-paced fun with a great cast and dangerous situations creating an exhausting thrill-ride with Lee in great form even though he doesn't even attempt to sound Chinese. Wilmer is effective at portraying Fu Manchu's adversary;he presents the commissioner as fast-thinking, wise, and courageous. Smith has to have certain attributes if he's able to somehow defeat a villain such as Fu Manchu, with lives at stake. I think Wilmer is convincing, selling his Smith as someone we can count on to catch the terrorists out to cause chaos and global mischief. There are some thrilling set-pieces, such as the opera house kidnapping, the fight that breaks out between the \"brides\" and Fu Manchu's dacoit soldiers, and an attempt at hi-jacking Marie in her hospital of employment. We get to see Baumer beat the hell out of Fu Manchu's men and the destruction of the Windsor Castle ship as Smith and his men failed in saving those killed is quite a stunner. Unfortunately, Fu Manchu's headquarters inside the foothills look like cheap sets(..it's clear, I believe, that producer Towers desires to mimic Hammer), but that did very little to distract me from the perilous situation the madman was creating for our heroes. There's so much going on, you have little time to catch your breath. Director Don Sharp once again shows his skills at creating a lot with little, crafting a nice adventure out of the money producer Harry Allan Towers was able to give him. Rounding out a solid cast includes Tsai Chin as Fu Manchu's daughter Lin Tang, ever supportive and willing to obey. Burt Kwouk(the Pink Panther movies)is Feng, Fu Manchu's top scientist who is leader over the mechanical operations functioning the energy sent to destroy targets at his boss' command. It's great to actually see Asians portraying Fu Manchu's Chinese soldiers.",
         "I love these old movies that were made when the words 'politically' and 'correct' were never used in the same sentence together. It is a bygone age of cinema where it was as simple as 'he's the good guy, that's the bad guy, sit back and be entertained'. Once again Christopher Lee absolutely owns the film whenever he's on the screen, such is the attention the man commands. Fu is a diabolical genius, he would probably be branded a terrorist in today's times. He has abducted the beautiful daughters of some of the world's prominent political figures and is using them to manipulate world politics. It's up to the equally nutty British cop Nayland Smith to cross swords with Fu (once again) and stop the yellow peril!! Not as good as 'The Face of Fu Manchu' but enjoyable nonetheless."
