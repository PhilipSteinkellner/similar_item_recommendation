         "I just watched this movie. Firstly, movie is not near as good as Sniper 1. And secondly some words about this so called Serbian fighters. I'm from Slovenia and I speak Serbian language. But in this movie I didn't understand not even one word. At the end of the movie I saw this list of actors. Those names are not Serbian but Hungarian. I don't know who (I know only that he's mind doesn't work as it should) said to director of this movie that Hungary and Serbia is one and the same country. Language, habits, mentality,�nothing is the same in these two countries. It's very sad that someone is making a movie about country and he doesn't even knows basics about this country. Movie quality: 3/10 Geography knowledge: 0/10",
         "After renting this movie by mistake, I said to myself 'how bad can it be, I'll just sit tight and give it a try'. My dear Lord, what a mistake. I am a war movie buff myself, and I can swallow a lot of inconsistency, dumb dialogue, poor acting, thin plot and lousy sets, but this was way below the threshold. This movie was full of each, and than some. Tom Berenger is at the age when he should be enjoying his retirement benefits in Florida. Who was he fighting at the end - Hungarians, Serbs, Muslims? I know that, by now proverbial bad guys, the Serbs (which itself tells you how 'cliche' the plot was) were the target, but they ended up speaking the Hungarian, and this in a scenery that screams 'This Be Happening in Hungary'. For God's sake, do you think that the viewers are so uneducated. I could continue ranting, but the main point is, don't waste your time as I did with mine. Mr. Smith gives it 1/10, only because there is no 0 rating.",
         "Yes, it's not a historical drama, but credibility about the milieu is a must even for action movies, otherwise they may easily get ridiculous, like this one. 1. Hungary is (was) a neighbor to ex-Yugoslavia, but never part of it. So Hungary was also absolutely out of the ethnic conflicts and remained greatly neutral throughout. 2. We should imagine the whole movie happens in Serbia (the biggest of the successor-states of ex-Yugoslavia), however, everybody talks Hungarian, which doesn't even sound alike. (Serbian language belongs to the Slavic group of Indo-European family of languages, while Hungarian belongs to the Finno-Ugric group of Ural-Altaic family. Different grammar, different pronunciation, different intonation, different rhythm, not a word in common). It may not matter for the Americans, but Eastern Europe (even tens of millions in Western Europe) clearly understand the difference. 2/a. On top of this, the written Serbian is using Cyrillic letters, while Hungarian is using Latin letters (with certain vowels bearing special accents). Whatever is written in the street scenes of the movie - e.g. the \"Szent Erzsébet\" (Saint Elizabeth)statue in front of the cathedral - is written in Latin letters in Hungarian language. 3. The Serbians are basically orthodox catholic by majority, while the Hungarians are basically Roman catholic. The cathedral bearing a central role in the movie has no connection to anything in a typical orthodox church in Serbia. 4. All cars in the streets bear Hungarian license plates, showing the country code (H) and Hungary's national flag left of the 3-letter/3-digit combination of license plates. 4/a. All military vehicles in the movie have Hungarian military license plates. 5. To make a street scene, which the movie-makers believed as typical, they collected and showed all kinds of lousy Eastern-European cars (even including the infamous Polish van called Zuk), but no Western cars even by mistake. Such street picture was typical in Hungary up to the early 80s and in Yugoslavia up to mid-70s, whilst the story is happening in late-90s. 5/a Only one car does not appear in the whole movie: the Yugoslavian-made Zastava, the newer models of which were still in quite a quantity in the streets of Serbia in the late-90s. 6. The Serbian police cars, which are hit and blown by the tram in the movie, are all of East-German-made Wartburgs (3-cylinder/2-stroke engine). Yugoslavian/Serbian police never had a Wartburg (unless a few sample/test cars, which I may not know). The typical Yugoslavian police car was locally built Zastava (originally Fiat-based cars), but in the late-90s (when the story is played) there were already hundreds of thousands of Western cars in Yugoslavia and even the police had many. 7. The tram-cars are of Hungarian-built UV models, never exported to any country (not even to Yugoslavia) and they have Hungarian route-boards installed on their noses. You don't need to make a historical drama to be correct about elementary basics like geography, era and ethnography of your story and not to mix up everything into a terrible and greatly stereotyped mess. Being a European, it doesn't matter what is happening in the movie, you don't know whether to laugh or to cry as it is completely impossible to empathize the story under such visual and verbal circumstances. When we make a movie which story is playing in New York, we don't show agave fields instead of Central Square with people in sombreros, eating chili con carne and taco in the streets and drinking tequila in the bars, even though Mexico is the neighboring country to the USA. So the American makers may have believed the whole world is completely stupid and believes what they think a stereotyped Eastern Europe should be, however, for us living in this region, it is like a direct insult. So I believe it is a big mistake to play this movie in European TV channels (it is also a mistake to play it in the rest of the world because it is misleading people and don't give any realistic background about real Serbian milieu, but at least non-Europeans don't know all those mistakes). Finally, compare this cheap lousy nonsense with Evita, the street scenes of which were also filmed in the streets of Budapest instead of Buenos Aires, but you cannot catch it because all details properly fit. Big shame on the producers of Sniper-2 !!!",
         "Tom Berenger is back! on a new secret mission to snipe a Serbian general who is responsible for ethnical cleaning towards Muslim people. Very Mild Story Spoiler: Tom Berenger who is out of the army gets a visit of CIA officer and a millitary captain, to discuss about a \"suicide\" mission. Tom easily admits YEAH! \" if i want to die, i want to die as a soldier\" looool :-), he wants his former military rank back \"in return\" Tom requests for a backup \"Bokeem Woodbine aka Cole\" comes and joins Berengers one man platoon. After that they will be dropped within enemy lines. And the rest will is for your eyes only! I feel sniper 2 is worthy sequel, ok we don't have Billy Zane anymore but Bokeem Woodbine \"Cole\" performed pretty well. If you can't enjoy a movie like Sniper 2 you can't shutdown your brain, and you shouldn't watch a movie like this in the first place for \"the criticism\". Call me a cheater but Berenger deserve some respect as B actor, therefore i rate it: 7/10 Hopefully we will see him back in Sniper 3 \"that would be something\" :) All and All.... Cool Berenger Movie! Cheers",
         "Sniper 2 is the sequel to the 1993 film SNIPER, both starring Tom Berenger. In this installment Beckett (Berenger) has been drummed out of the marines due to the finger he lost in the first film (I had to go back and see if that happened -- it did). He's down on his luck and getting by as a hunting guide and by winning sniper competitions when the government contacts him. They will give him anything to return to action and kill a rouge Eastern European general. Beckett's \"anything\" turns out to be his uniform and rank returned. He is then hooked up with Cole (Bookim Woodbine) and dropped in enemy territory. The mission goes well, Beckett kills his mark but then things take a terrible twist. The rest of the film is a rather exciting adventure where things are not what they seem to be. I found this film on Cinemax and really enjoyed it. Great action from the first to the last frame. Berenger looks great and reprises his role with class. Woodbine is a bit smug at first like he's enjoying a joke we don't get, but he gets better as the film goes on. The twist is very clever and I never saw it coming. As I said I watched the original after I saw this installment and will vouch that the sequel is far better. It's non-stop action with a couple of great lines.",
         "Tom makes this film, and it is a decent late night film that was intended to a b film, What surprised me was the budget, what the US dollar can get in Hugary. I mean they got tank, choppers, lots of troops, and a believable military actors. This is still a B movie, but watchable. PS they leave room for Sniper 3 with the ending. It was a power one. 6/10",
         "I liked the first \"Sniper\" movie and especially liked Becker (played by Tom Berenger). He's a solemn and sometimes grumpy sniper who bickers and argues (but also looks after) anyone he's partnered with on a mission. I saw the original film as more of a `character study' of this solitary Becker character, and was not disappointed that the sequel was mostly a character study as well. Though of course there is plenty of action and suspense as well! \"Sniper 2\" re-works the same formula as the first film, but with some differences. Becker is a little older, but he's still grumpy (but protective) as ever. The guy he's partnered up with in this film is different than the somewhat green and annoying Billy Zane character in the first film. I liked this new guy pretty well. And I liked seeing Becker again. I'd grown fond of Becker in the first film, and I thought the sequel held up well. Sure, it could have been better, but really, it was not bad at all. It's a solid film--not earth-shatteringly great, but if you enjoyed the way the first movie went, and especially enjoyed the characters, then you'll like this film.",
         "In this directors world, Serbs speak Hungarian, Budapest is capital of Serbia and Muslims have been living in eastern Europe for 600 years. Nazis and Communists are killing Muslims in the Eastern Europe LMFAO! Acting does not exist. Ed Wood's \"Plan 9 from outer space\" has nothing on this movie. This is stupidity at it's best made by and for the Average Joe; so he has something \"easy-on-the-brain\" to watch when he comes home from working at the burger shack. I am putting this as the second worst movie i have ever seen, first one being the \"Dracula 3000\".",
         "I found this movie well thought out and for the most part well executed. However, it most glaring flaw was with its technical aspects. In the scene, where the underground partisan, Sophia, brings Sgt. Beckett beneath a tavern, to a store of WWII arms. Sgt. Beckett picks up a rifle and calling it a German 8mm Mauser. But in reality it is a Russian 7.62 Mosin Nagant, to which he adds the proper Russian sniper scope and mount. I was very surprised at this and wonder who was at fault. But otherwise, I felt this film is another success for Tom Berenger.",
         "The first \"Sniper\" was one of Berenger's best action movies, so I was hyped when I heard they made a second one. I ended up picking \"Sniper 2\" up at Half Price Books for a dollar so I guess I wasn't expecting that much. The story is simple. Berenger plays an older Thomas Beckett, now being pitched on a mission to assassinate a general who is responsible for a genocide on his native land. Bokeem Woodbine plays Cole, another tough guy being sent on the mission with Berenger. As a lower budget action movie this served it's purpose well. Berenger is a great actor who has sadly been tossed into roles that are below his acting capability but he does a great job as Beckett. Woodbine also turns in a good performance. Despite the budget the cinematography is really quite good. The setting is realistic (I'm sorry but I didn't pay attention to the dialects in relation to the geography, come on, watch a movie for the entertainment value). The costumes are believable. Conclusion, I enjoyed watching a classic actor like Tom Berenger dole out some harshness in a cool action movie. If you don't expect that much you should too."
