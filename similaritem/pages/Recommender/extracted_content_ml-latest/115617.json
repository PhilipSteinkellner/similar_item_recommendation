      "synopsis": "In the city of San Fransokyo (a portmanteau of San Francisco and Tokyo), Hiro Hamada ( Ryan Potter) is a teenage prodigy, but seems to be unable to use his intellect for anything more than trying to enter illegal, back-alley bot-fights. His older brother Tadashi ( Daniel Henney) wishes to change Hiro's mind, and tricks his brother into coming to the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology, where Tadashi is a student. While there, Hiro is introduced to a number of Tadashi's 'nerd school' friends: Go Go ( Jamie Chung), Wasabi ( Damon Wayans Jr.), Honey Lemon ( Genesis Rodriguez), and Fred ( T.J. Miller), and the different inventions they have constructed. Tadashi then shows Hiro his own project: an inflatable 'nurse' robot, named Baymax ( Scott Adsit). Thanks to a chip that Tadashi programmed with numerous medical analysis information, Baymax is quite knowledgeable, impressing Hiro. Once he has performed his task, Baymax returns to sleep mode by being told, \"I am satisfied with my care.\" The three also meet Robert Callaghan ( James Cromwell), the head professor of the Institute, and after he compliments Hiro on the miniature battle-robot he's made, Hiro wants to enter the Institute. Tadashi then encourages his brother to come up with something that will impress Callaghan at the next robotics exhibit coming up. After Tadashi encourages his brother to 'use that big brain of yours,' Hiro then uses the robotic technology in his battle-bot, and crafts them into thousands of micro-bots, controlled by a neural transmitter. Whatever the wearer thinks, the microbots will do. Needless to say, Hiro's presentation wins over a number of people at the exhibition, even impressing a high-profile technology guru, named Alistair Krei ( Alan Tudyk). Alistair offers to purchase Hiro's microbot invention on the spot, but Callaghan claims that Krei is not a trustworthy man with technology. Hiro then declines Krei's request, but is excited when Callaghan presents him with a letter of acceptance to the Institute. Hiro, Tadashi, and their friends head off to celebrate, but the mood is cut short when a fire erupts within the exhibition hall. With word that Callaghan is still inside, Tadashi rushes into the building to save him. However, as Hiro watches, an explosion rocks the building, blasting him back. After Tadashi's funeral, Hiro becomes distant from his friends, still working through his grief. His aunt (and guardian) Cass ( Maya Rudolph), tries to encourage Hiro to go to the Institute and take advantage of his acceptance letter, but he seems unwilling to do so. After accidentally hurting himself in his room, Hiro is surprised when Baymax appears. Apparently, Tadashi had brought him back to their shared bedroom before he died. Baymax attempts to help Hiro, who is reluctant to accept it. However, the mood is broken when Hiro finds one of his microbots wriggling in a pocket of his jacket. Putting it in a specimen container, Hiro tries to ignore it, but Baymax notes inquires if he can try to determine where the 'small robot' wishes to go. Hiro casually affirms this...not realizing that the robot will follow his commands. Chasing him down, Hiro and Baymax find themselves at an old warehouse. Sneaking inside, Hiro is surprised to find a machine churning out similar microbots, with numerous containers filled with them. However, his surprise turns to shock, when a masked man appears, attempting to kill Hiro and Baymax with the miniature robots. Hiro first goes to the police station to report what he's found, but the officer taking down his story seems reluctant to believe him. It also doesn't help that Baymax's battery starts to run low. Hiro manages to get him home to be recharged. It is then that Baymax inquires where Tadashi is. Hiro attempts to explain to the robot that his brother is 'gone.' When Hiro explains that the fire was an accident, he then begins to wonder, given what he saw today...what if it wasn't, an accident? Deciding to figure out who has stolen his invention, Hiro decides to upgrade Baymax. After creating a carbon-fiber suit for the robot, Hiro also programs a new chip that includes numerous martial arts moves, inserting it into an additional slot in Baymax's 'heart' drive, right next to Tasashi's chip of Baymax's programming. The two then return to the warehouse, only to find it empty. However, Hiro notes his microbot has started to move again, and the two follow its movements to the docks off San Fransokyo. However, something pulls the microbot out of the container, and it disappears off into the misty bay. However, moments later, the masked figure appears, using the microbots as a transport means, and carrying a large object with the symbol of a red bird on it. Hiro is just about to send Baymax to get the masked man, when they are accosted by Hiro's friends. Baymax's invite for them to help cheer up Hiro got through, but just then, the masked man attacks them. The group pile into Wasabi's car, as the masked man gives chase. In the aftermath, the car ends up driving into the bay, but the group is saved by Baymax, who has shed his armor, and helps the group float to the surface. After getting on land, Fred leads the group to his home...which happens to be a large mansion owned by his parents (who are away). While recovering, Hiro shows the group the red bird symbol he saw on the piece of machinery to his friends, but none have seen it. The group soon comes to a consensus, that the man may have been behind Tadashi's death, and Fred believes he knows who it is: Alistair Krei. Fred explains that it was Krei who wanted Hiro's microbot technology, and most likely, has gained it at the expense of Tadashi's life. Baymax also surprises Hiro, when he explains that during the fight, he scanned the masked man, and has information on his health and vitals. Hiro wants to identify where their adversary is, but he would need to scan everyone in San Fransokyo to find out. The group then decides to band together to stop Krei, with Hiro helping to design them each special suits based on their specific abilities. Once Hiro has done this, he and Baymax fly up above the city, and scan the city from an aerial fan. Baymax's sensors pick up their adversary's health vitals, coming from an island in the bay. The group flies there, to find a deserted base. One room shows the twisted metal remains of some machine, with the red bird symbol on it. The group then goes into a control room, where video shows that the room was used for testing a teleportation project, called \"Operation: Silent Sparrow.\" Suddenly, their masked adversary appears, and the group attempts to take him down, but are completely unsure what to do. Hiro manages to unmask their foe, but instead of finding Krei...he finds Professor Callaghan. Callaghan explains that in the fire, he managed to use Hiro's microbot technology to shield himself from the explosion. This infuriates Hiro, who demands that Baymax destroy Callaghan. Baymax claims that his programming doesn't allow this, leading to Hiro pulling out the chip Tadashi put in him. The removal of the chip causes Baymax to follow Hiro's orders, and he charges at Callaghan. However, Hiro's friends attempt to stop Baymax, with the robot fighting back at them, before Honey manages to restore Tadashi's chip to his programming. Callaghan has escaped during the fight, and Hiro demands that Baymax find him, only for the robot to explain that his scanners are damaged. Bent on revenge, Hiro blasts away with Baymax back to the garage. He attempts to update Baymax's programming, but Baymax refuses to open the port where his chip information is. In desperation, Hiro finally breaks down over the death of his brother, with Baymax countering that, 'Tadashi is here.' As Hiro watches, Baymax projects video of Tadashi's numerous attempts to get him running, with the 84th test being a success, and Tadashi claiming that Baymax is \"going to help a whole lot of people.\" Hiro's friends eventually return to the garage where he is, and reveal that they have found further footage of the military test. The footage shows Professor Callaghan also at the test area, and reveal his motives behind his actions. During the test, a human test subject was propelled into the portal. However, the portal became unstable, and Krei ordered it shut down. It turns out that the test subject, was Callaghan's daughter, Abigail ( Katie Lowes). The next day, Krei is revealing the opening of a new facility in the heart of San Fransokyo, when Callaghan appears, using the microbots to piece together the last active portal, over Krei's building. Callaghan claims he's going to ruin Krei's life like he ruined his, as the portal comes to life, and starts to tear apart the building, sucking its pieces into the other dimension. It is then that Hiro and his friends appear, pleading with Callaghan to stop what he's doing, but the former Professor refuses to listen to reason. The group attempts to stop him, but Callaghan uses the microbots to counter their attacks. During the fight, Hiro notices that the stray microbots are being sucked up into the portal, and he and the rest of the team work to hack away at their structures, until Callaghan is soon down to a bare minimum. Baymax manages to remove the control mask from him, but once he's done so, notes a faint life signal from within the portal. Even though it is unstable, Hiro and Baymax head into it. Within the otherworldly atmosphere, they find the test pod, with Abigail inside. Baymax and Hiro then attempt to maneuver her out of the dimension, but a stray piece of debris from Krei's building slams into Baymax, ripping away much of his suit, and rendering his rocket boosters inoperable. Baymax claims that he can get Hiro and Abigail to safety by using his rocket punch. Hiro doesn't want to lose Baymax, but the robot assures the boy, that he'll \"always be with him.\" Tearfully, Hiro utters \"I'm satisfied with my care,\" and Baymax launches off his rocket fist, getting Hiro and Callaghan's daughter through the portal, just before it tears itself apart. In the aftermath, Abigail is taken to a hospital, and Callaghan is arrested for his crimes. In the meantime, local news reports on a band of superheroes that saved the city. However, Hiro and his friends celebrate by having some downtime at his Aunt's place. Shortly afterwards, Hiro starts his classes at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology. Taking residence in the same lab that Tadashi has, Hiro has brought along the rocket fist Baymax wore...only to find wedged in its closed fist, the green microchip card that Tadashi had put into Baymax. Hiro manages to rebuild Baymax, and places the chip inside him, embracing his fellow comrade. In the end, we see Hiro, Baymax, and their friends, running through the streets of San Fransokyo, ready to help their city, in any way they can.",

         "Back in 2009, Disney purchased Marvel Comics for four billion dollars. Shocking and surprising the world, many fans of both sides were curious whether Disney would make an animation film based on a group of characters from the comics. Three years later, Director Don Hall approached John Lasseter on making a film with Marvel Characters and found the Big Hero 6, a comic book series that even the most well known of comics didn't know who they were. In fact they were so obscure that Marvel themselves even forgot that they had the characters. Marvel gave Disney the liberty to change the characters so that they could be seen as a Disney Animation Film. And the result is simply refreshing. Big Hero 6 is a beautiful film, showcasing how much animation has become. The east and west coast mash up of San Fransokyo combines to make such a spectacular scenery, that the city may as well be a character to the film. The cast is also fun to watch. One annoyance films try to do is by shoving the diversity of characters in your face. Big Hero 6 doesn't do that, instead the focus is on the characters themselves and not the diversity, making it enjoyable to watch. One of the biggest highlights is the girls of the cast. I took my 3 nieces with my friends and I, and they loved how they were smart, enjoyable and didn't need to fall for a man. The cast is truly relatable, whether you are precise like Wasabi, positive like Honey Lemon or just a guy who loves media like Fred. Of course the star of the film is the robot of Baymax. Any scene that he is in steals the show, whether it is his introduction or his care for Hiro and Company. The Villain by far is one of the best villains in recent Disney history, he doesn't sing, dance or monologue, he simply gets the job done. The film showcases the action greatly by giving large scopes and music that fits exceptionally well. Emotionally, the film captures the audience by showcasing the bond of brotherhood between Hiro and his older brother Tadashi, as well as his friend Baymax who is like a Surrogate brother to our main hero. A strong lesson in this film, is that family can be more than blood related, you have friends, who become part of that. That really showed how much I cared for the loved ones around me, especially my older brother who is in the military, creating robots and fixing medical equipment. If there was one complaint I would give, I would've like to see a little bit more about the rest of the team. Other than that, Big Hero 6 is a heartwarming tale that captures something for the entire family. Big Hero 6 is another showing that Disney can continue to make great films after the juggernaut that was Frozen. This film showcases that the Disney Revival (Films such as The Princess and the Frog, Tangled, Wreck-it-Ralph and Frozen) is not over yet, and I cannot wait to see what the next film has to offer.",
         "To be honest, when I saw the preview I thought it was going to be another Disney movie gone bad. So when the movies came around, I had really low expectations for it. But holy crap nothing has made me laugh this hard at a movie since maybe Amelie or Up! Baymax is a non-threatening huggable robot who's only purpose is to nurse those who are in need of medical attention. The only way to wake him up is to scream out \"OW\" and he is alive and will help you until you are better. The only way to put him back to sleep is to say \"I'm satisfied with your work\" (Or something like that I'm only paraphrasing) and he has gone back to sleep. But this movie isn't all comedy: it does have a bit of an emotional side to it which I won't go into too much detail about. However I do know that the movie isn't really like the comic books: the back stories of the characters aren't how they are in the movie and even the plot itself isn't like how the movie is, so for the devoted comic book fans, I understand if you hate this movie. However the people who didn't read the comics confuse me when they say it's \"Cliche\" \"awful\" \"boring\". I found none of these things in the movie at all. I was smiling right from the beginning and found myself a little teary-eyed towards the end. So I do recommend this movie if you're up for a nice light movie with a lot of laughs: it might be better than you think.",
         "Contains spoilers, pass this review if you don't want to see any spoilers, such as end scenes and more. I actually wasn't planning to watch this particular movie, until my friends told me it was a good movie and that I should watch it. I decided to try it and see how it goes. I instantly fell in love with Baymax. He's huggable and simply adorable. Along with that, he's a HEALTHCARE companion! It was certainly a HILARIOUS movie, and I enjoyed every last bit of it. I love how that Hiro, originally a boy who was interested only in bot fights, decides to do something big- starting with joining the nerd lab. There. he meets people like Wasabi, Fred, Go-Go, and more. This movie also played with your emotions. And no, not just a little bit, but a lot. Disney seriously did a good job doing that. This movie was one of those that actually almost made me cry. Near the end, Baymax had supposedly \"died\" and that made me very emotional. I was so happy that at the end, Hiro managed to make another Baymax using the chip the original Baymax had left behind. All I have to say is that this movie is definitely one worth watching, especially if you like humorous animated films.",
         "Big Hero 6 [2014] is the Disney 3-D animated comedy action film that centers on Hiro Hamada, a 14-year old robotics prodigy, Baymax (an inflatable health companion robot) and an unlikely team of superheros. 5/5 graphics. Big Hero 6 transports viewers into a new visual realm and relatively individual style (besides its anime resemblance). The story is set in the futuristic city of 'San Fransokyo'. A little of Tokyo and San Francisco in one place. This explains the amalgamation of both Japanese and American components within the story and setting. It should be noted that Big Hero 6 is not a wholly original idea, and the animation is inspired by the Marvel comic by the very same name. Baymax. Voiced by Scott Adsit, this lovable robot is animated to appear soft, cuddly and adorable, credit goes to the graphics and writing team on this one. Hiro's close friendship with Baymax is a highlight. Baymax can hold his own on the screen alone too, just strolling through the city streets, caring for others health and well-being. So yeah, he's cute and he knows it. Expect to have a couple of teary moments. I won't describe or skim through details, out of utmost respect for those who haven't had a chance to see it yet. Since more serious topics aren't the usual in children targeted animation films, it's a nice change of pace. Fantastic message for the young'uns. The main character Hiro (voiced by Ryan Potter) and the rest of the superheros team study robotics at the local university (including T.J. Miller from Silicon Valley and Damon Wayans Jr from New Girl). Reach your potential, practice non-violence and exercise sacrifice. That's just the tip of the iceberg. There are more spoiler-worthy ones that will be omitted from this review entirely. By the way, it's not 'preachy' in the slightest.",
         "As much as I am shocked like everyone else is, this movie gets too much undeserved hatred. Did I watch the same movie like those who didn't like it did? Was this movie really that horrible or stupid or a \"waste of time\"? My answer to those questions are: Nope, I don't think so. Are we \"really\" going to live in a generation where we're supposed to believe that almost every movie that makes today is the same and filled with overused clichés? I won't believe it people, that's just a stupid fact. While BH6 is based upon a superhero comic it worked out just fine, I can't remember the last time I truly enjoyed a superhero film especially when it's 100% animated. But first of all I just want to say that I am ridiculously tired of hearing and reading from people saying that this is a movie that only kids will enjoy. Whenever I hear that thought it makes me feel sick about it, if I can comment to that thought everyone and I do mean everyone can enjoy this film. Don't let this \"thought\" fool you because Big Hero 6 deliveries more than just what that particular thought wants you to believe into. And I don't even want to remember in the future that a movie like Big Hero 6 is being known as a \"just another ordinary kid flick\", no screw that! That's just preposterous. My next comment is that I am also getting tired of hearing people saying that it wasn't like or as fun as \"Frozen\". Why on Earth does it have to be like or as fun as \"Frozen\"? This movie was nothing like that other movie and it didn't have to be either. And frankly this movie is so much better and smarter than \"Frozen\" which BTW I was disappointed with (no offense I really wanted to like that film but there were too many things I just couldn't bare into.) Without any musical numbers I still enjoyed it, although I dig the main theme song by Fall Out Bay (no I'm not familiar with them but the song managed to be catchy.) But wait I have another comment and that goes to those who says this was a complete \"ripoff\" of \"How To Train Your Dragon\". 1. Hiro did not find Baymax it was Tadashi who introduced him at first and then Baymax himself found Hiro by hearing his pain, plus he was moved to their house. 2. BH6 and HTTYD have different issues: BH6 is about technology coming in the wrong hands. HTTYD is about the conflict between humans and dragons. I simply don't see any resemblances. 3. Just because actor T.J. Miller appeared on both films it doesn't make any copies of his characters he voiced to since two of them are completely different characters. So stop believing that BH6 is a ripoff of HTTYD. Like I said before BH6 delivers more than what you might think it is. I won't spoil any important plot lines but I will say some things that kept this movie for being such a watchable film especially it's good morals. If you've been looking for an animated movie with good morals this is the movie you have been waiting for and some of the examples are: 1. What makes Tadashi such a good and thoughtful person is how he cares about his little brother and wants him to do something good and he's careful with people he don't know. He did a good job to remind Krei not to steal one of Hiro's Microbot just like that. 2. When was it the last time a certain supporting character in the movies of Disney were really this smart and helpful and would give a lot of good ideas to help someone who's depressed? Baymax apart from being adorable and funny was always there for him and never left him out of his sight. But also a character that learned his own way of helping people. 3. And of course Hiro himself whom I'm happy that they showed a character of how it is like to be cocky and later realizing to finally do something good for once in his life instead of squandering his gift. Oh and let's not forget about Hiro's friends Go Go, Wasabi, Honey Lemon and Fred. I know what many people has said about them but trust me they're not characterless, each of them had different personalities which is what made them a memorable team and they were always there for Hiro whenever he needed them. Let me also say that the animation was undoubtedly gorgeous and detail rich that the sets nearly looked photorealistic (apparently IMDb doesn't seem to know that the word \"photorealistic\" is indeed a real independent word) plus the Microbots were extremely well presented. I just couldn't resist to say it but it would be good to know since I know that many people are worried if the animation process hasn't been taken seriously but fear not BH6 was beautiful to look at. Even though if it wouldn't have won the Oscar I still think it would be a worth watching film no matter what. In addition: A movie isn't bad just because it couldn't be like previous movies by the same company that made it. I for one enjoyed this, it felt fresh and added a story that at least looks for goals and learning them. The movie did an amazing job to tell its superhero story, I don't even think I've seen a similar story like BH6 before.",
         "I can't believe the reviews. people saying: too predictable, too cliché, the same all over again. Hey, people, IT'S A MOVIE FOR KIDS. Now you expect that all the cartoon and animation movies for kids fills your expectations? Are you kidding me? This is a great KIDS movie that teaches respect, vengeance is not good, friendship, to pursuit your dreams and most important: If you are talented, don't waste it. I'm 30 years old. I didn't wanted to see this movie and I absolutely loved it. the part when Baymax is running out of gas, he is acting drunk. I was laughing in tears. Stop trying to make Pixar, Disney or Dreamworks work FOR YOU. Their movies is FOR KIDS. We apologize that kids love this film but you didn't because \"it's too predictable\". maybe if you people see this movie in a child's' eyes, you would like it and enjoy it as I did.",
         "Im more of a renter then a movie goer, and i watched this movie right after watching Interstellar, so i will always remember this sequence as probably one of the most satisfying weeks of watching new movies. The movie is well balanced (besides having no romance whatsoever), suspenseful, unpredictable, action packed, innovative, touching (even tear jerking) and beautifully presented with a fantastic ending (always important). There is a little bias, it is set in San Frantokyo and I reside in the bay area so i loved that part (because were kind of the center of the world over here), and its not a first time seeing the idea since they did something similar in Cloudy 2, but none the less it was done way better and way less dumbed down. I won't get too much into the story line, but the ride takes quite a few turns turns. Certain goals are made in the movie and once their met, a sudden turn is taken in an unpredictable way, making it pretty suspenseful. They also make an interesting connection between Hiro, his brother Tadashi, and Tadashi's invention \"Baymax\", the worlds first robotic health care companion. The other 4 of the 6 don't have the hugest role (similar to How to train a dragon), and their powers aren't amazing either, however, when needed they make a mark in the action scenes and in some of supportive situations as friends. There's no pure evil in the movie, always rationally fueled evil. And the fact that its futuristic, animated and about robotics and inventions, gave the staff plenty of potential for innovation and they did a great job with it. Once again the movie was so well balanced, and though i could see a girl maybe not liking this because there isn't romance, the connections between brothers and friends, and some of the other family references make it watchable for most people. It should be an additionally exciting watch for the older and perhaps nerdy type who can catch on with some of the technology and subtleties. However, even my GF said that some of the sadder moments were extremely touching. Once again, they use animation and futurism to their advantage with the touching scenes. The first Marvel Animation made under Disney and they start it off with a bang. It wasn't hugely advertised, and there was a large Asian influence on it Hence the city San Frantokyo which might be why it wasn't advertised greatly(Disney tends to do that) but I absolutely love this movie. I rented it again a week later, and i think i will purchase this one for sure (along with interstellar).",
         "Please don't listen to the bad reviews and watch this yourself. I registered with IMDb just to write this. That is how much faith I have in this film. I really cannot believe some of these bad reviews.. \"Not a kids film\"?? kids would go mental for this. Animation was nothing short of exquisite Comedy was extremely funny (and i'm not one for comedies) Story line was really great too Also made me cry a little... meh please please please watch how awesome this is. i'm nearly 28 and I absolutely loved it.",
         "I refuse to believe that this is an awful movie that users around here with such abysmal ratings and thoughts wants you to believe it is. If you happen to read those reviews you'll find that they are only perturbed that the movie and it's story is predictable, filled with clichés, fast paced or being an idiotic film or the fact that they still don't like the idea that Marvel is being owned by the Disney Company and it's certain characters have received some brief changes. I'm really starting to think that those users didn't take the movie seriously, just because a certain movie happens to be a \"Disney\" movie it does not mean that every movie from them should be the considered for doing the same typical actions. Big Hero 6 delivers more than just of those prejudices for what Disney is famous for. If you really want to know how the movie was, let me \"just a little bit\" tell my experience with it. First of all the beginning of movie worked fine, it showed a good-spirited brotherhood with Tadashi for caring his little brother Hiro and giving him his thoughts of what he really should do with this gift. Hiro as the main character reminded me a lot of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, sure just like him Hiro was a flawed character but in the movie it showed him how he shouldn't be squandering his gifts as well. I didn't find him bratty or annoying, you will find that deeply inside of him he's a good person despite being a little shy to show it. The supporting characters are not ghosts or unnecessary filler they are indeed one of the important keys to this movie and its title. We do get to learn them well enough. What's wrong with a movie that happens to be a little fast paced? Fast paced movies can be entertaining too guys, remember Inception? But unlike that movie I got to learn the supporting characters well and they're likable as well with their own personalities. Just to inform it wasn't that extremely fast to follow. What about Baymax? He is in my personal opinion one of the best robots in movies I have seen. I was glad to see him being both likable and smart at the same time. I had so much fun to see him learning about the humanity from both Hiro and his friends especially the Fist-Bump scenes. Of course this movie was based upon the Comic books but I don't really understand why some people think that it's title should have been changed just because it didn't become the movie they expected. Look the movie is about how the team got created in the first place while showing a good story and reason to their build up. I strongly disagree that it should have been called Big Hero 1 or 2 no, no, no you must be kidding here :P. But most importantly I'm happy to see that Big Hero 6 managed to deliver good moralities. I haven't seen a Disney movie having so many good thoughts since \"Wreck-It Ralph\". I dare to say that this movie surpasses my disappointment from \"Frozen\". This is not an idiotic film, there's plenty of both the entertainment and good moralities that I don't think I've seen from other previous Disney movies. Like (just an example): be careful for someone you don't know or trust yet. See? And another thing, ignore those who says its a kids flick and that stupid prejudice about \"animated films are for kids only\". No! Everyone no matter the age should see this. I wasn't angry at all to find out that it won its Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film and I'm happy that finally a movie with such good-spirited presentation got what it deserved.",
         "I popped along to the most anticipated movie of my Babes Inflatables. Big Hero 6. The film surrounds an Inflatbles that sets about saving the a town. How it stats that is that a young kid Hiro has an amazing relationship with his Bro Tashadi. Hero starts with Robo Fighting. His bro Tashadi is exceptionally looking out for him. I've never seen such closeness. He brings his Bro Hiro to a Nerd School college kinda. Hiro is overwhelmed. He meets Baymax(INFLATBLES). He's an Inflatable Robot that is a \"Healthcare Companion\". They go on a journey in finding out the mysterious person who was involved the fire. Overall a FANTASTIC film. Pure emotional at times. But fantastic. I smell a sequel on its way."
