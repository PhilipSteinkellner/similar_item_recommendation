         "I first saw GRAVE SECRETS about 10 years ago and recently bought the DVD here in the UK. I myself am a paranormal investigator and found this movie to be one of the best movies based on a factual ghost story I've ever seen, Yes it is a TV Movie, So if you are expecting Special effects galore and Hollywood-ised horror then you wont get it here. This is one of the most realistic movies based on ghosts and is mostly like how it really is. The story is based on actual events \"the legacy of hilltop drive\" and stars the amazing actress \"Patty Duke\" who is well known for all her excellent \"based on real events\" TV Movies. This movie has an excellent story, and what makes it even more gripping and interesting is that its based on real events that happened to the whole neighbourhood at hilltop drive. Every house hold had a ghost and eventually the whole neighbourhood was empty as everyone eventually moved away as they could no longer take living with the ghosts. It is fact that the real Hill top drive is now a abandoned neighbourhood and no one lives there. I highly recommend this movie to serious Patty Duke fans, and people who like a good ghost movie that doesn't have all the scary factor thrills that come from Hollywood movies. Although the movie IS SCARY, it just doesn't need special effects to make it scary!",
         "This made for TV movie is actually a pretty good little ghost story without all the gore and blood and guts. Patty Duke is always good in whatever she is in, and this is no exception. The movie is based on a true \"haunting\" of a home in Crosby, Texas. The Williams family saved their whole lives to build their dream home only to find out after moving in it was built over a cemetery. There aren't many special effects, only toilets flushing by themselves and some \"shadowy\" looking figures roaming around, so that part of the movie is pretty weak, but this movie is more about the wife trying to convince her husband that there really is something supernatural going on, and their struggle with the developer of the subdivision. So it is not a conventional \"horror\" movie, but worth watching nonetheless.",
         "In the late 80s, Ben and Jean Williams sank their savings into having their dream home built not knowing that the developers had callously and coldly plowed over and built on top of a hitherto forgotten old black cemetery. Actually, you may want to blame the original owner for not telling the developers.Of course,the spirits of the dead are not going to sit still for this and fight back as only they can - dirty!. Instead of a psychological good-notch ghost story, the movie tells the plight of the Williams against the developers who built the Williams house. Sounds like the plot to \"Poltergeist,\" doesn't it ? This true story is the more accurate account of the actual events near Crosby,Texas. David Selby goes from fake ghosts on \"Dark Shadows\" to dealing with real ones in this factual if not stirring movie. Patty Duke plays his forceful and endearing wife (I guess his DS co-star Kathryn Leigh Scott wasn't available) who tries to convince him of the ghosts' existence, but fails to do so until he gets the cahones scared out of him. David Soul plays the neighbor,Sam Haney, who put in a swimming pool and accidentally dug up the bodies. Stand-up comedian Blake Clark from \"Home Improvement\" is the jovial neighbor next door whose wife gets scared in the middle of the night and permanently moves out. Interesting enough, Blake has seen real ghosts himself in the haunted Laugh Factory Comedy Club in Los Angeles,California. This movie though has a wonderful plot, but it's more of a re-enactment than a movie. Thank goodness, the Warrens never got involved (see the movie \"The Haunted\" - 1992) or else this whole story might have smacked of a hoax. Not to insult the Warrens, of course, I really respect their profession, but every time they get involved, someone screams \"Hoax !\" (such as in the whole \"The Amityville Horror\" mythos). The characters are wonderfully portrayed, but the supernatural aspects and suspense has been played down for a more than intelligent ghost story. The only ghosts seem to be paper cut-outs seen as shadows, but then they might not have had the budget for all the special effects. The best but most brief shot is when Selby first comes across the ghosts. The movie is very realistic and emotional with some thought-provoking questions. For the full story, you need to read, \"The Black Hope Horror\" by Robert Curran who must have had \"The Amityville Horror \" in mind when he conceived the title. Don't get that movie confused with this one; this one may not be as chilling, but it makes much more sense.",
         "+------------+ WARNING: SOME SPOILERS AHEAD +------------+ I really enjoy this film, simply because it's well made for a TV movie. Generally many TV horror movies are largely forgettable, simply because they are limited as to what they can include. Theatrical movies usually do more since they can show more that the TV genre cannot. Grave Secrets was shot in 1992, so it's 11-12 years old as I'm writing this. The special effects may appear somewhat dated by today's CGI razzle dazzle, but they still work well. The only thing that some people might not be able to suspend their disbelief about, is the \"ghost shadows\" in a couple of scenes. But, if you research the unknown you may have heard of \"Shadow People\", or \"Shadow Beings\" as some would call them. It is an actual documented phenomenon, just as a normal ghost sighting is. When you research this in advance, it lends those scenes a much creepier and realistic effect. I think the acting was especially talented and well executed. Patty Duke especially, but all of the cast members did a great job. True, the story of Grave Secrets is nothing entirely original and has the feel of an Amityville Horror sequel, but it's still quite entertaining. I wouldn't say everyone will be scared or disturbed by Grave Secrets, but if you like ghost genre movies you'll most likely enjoy the movie. I've seen the movie at least six or seven times before, and I still enjoy it!",
         "This movie is about a true ghost experience that happened that happened to a couple in Texas. Other comments have been made about that it wasn't a good plot or that ghosts don't have shadows. This was not just a movie but a true story and those things really happened. For a true story, this was a pretty good movie and not just some made up Hollywood fantasy movie.",
         "for a \"made for TV\" movie,this offering isn't too bad.there are a few genuinely creepy moments for sure.one good thing is there are no cheap jump out of seat scares.you know,loud noises,or someone,or something appearing in a mirror,or a cat jumping out of a closet.that sort of thing.the acting seemed a bit suspect at first,but as the movie went on,it seemed to improve.i got involved enough in the story and cared enough about the characters that i really felt for them as they were going through their ordeal.this one has based on a true story tag on it,but you have to take that with a grain of salt.either way,i did find it much more compelling than the recently released The Haunting in Connecticut.for me,Grave Secrets: The Legacy of Hilltop Drive is a 6/10",
         "Pretty much what you would expect from a '90s television horror movie; a retread of plot themes already covered - in a far better way - in many other films. Bad acting, scenes of sentimental dross. And this film doesn't even give us any special effects to laugh at, which makes it very dull indeed. The acting is consistently poor, performed by low-level actors who fill out bland, uninteresting roles. I mean, one guy is called Shag, which pretty much sums up the awfulness of this film. The only actor of interest is a slumming David Soul but even he doesn't appear very much. The plot has generally been stolen from POLTERGEIST, with bits of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR and the odd scene from THE BIRDS thrown in for good measure. Except, forget any frightening phenomena...the ghost in this film delights in repeatedly flushing toilets and making the garage door go haywire. Yeah, really scary. The main trouble is that the plot just doesn't go anywhere. It briefly looks like it's going to get interesting with the family contacting a lawyer to start some kind of legal battle with the estate agents, but even this theme is not explored fully. At least they didn't opt for an overly sentimental ending, instead one of the main characters, who has a weak heart, drops dead, and the family moves out, defeated. This is probably about the only mildly interesting point of the entire film. It's long, it's boring and it doesn't go anywhere. So what if it's based on a true story, I want sensationalism in my films, not endless scenes of nothing happening! Forget this one at all costs.",
         "Think Poltergeist minus the crazy special effects. I enjoyed the film, quite a bit. Patti Duke, David Soul and Dark Shadows' David Selby were all a huge part of my childhood so seeing them all in the same film was very gratifying for me. For a made for TV film, the look of the film was quite good. It's a more realistic view of how an average family would deal with a haunting, as opposed to many blockbusters, where the characters seem less unconvinced and more vehement that everything is okay. The only problem I had with the film was some of the over done \"folksy charm\" of the characters. If you're looking for the Conjuring or Insidious, this isn't the film for you. If you're looking for a spooky little film with familiar faces, you'll love this one.",
         "A couple move into their dream home, unaware that it and its neighbours have been built over land formerly used as a cemetery. The film is said to have been based on a true story, although how much of it is supposed to be true is not disclosed. The plot is hardly unique - see Spielberg's 'Poltergeist' (1982). Within a short time, they experience various supernatural phenomena: these range from the disturbing - mysterious shadows, the serious illness of the daughter - to the frankly ridiculous - toilets continually flushing and garage doors going out of control. There is little depth to the story: once it has become established that the land had been used as a cemetery, we do not learn anything more. The plot does not seem to develop. The characters are not particularly well drawn or in any way memorable, nor is the atmosphere particularly special. The film could be disturbing to some viewers. There is no sense of catharsis or any kind of positive message from it.",
         "Jean and Shag are a retired couple who move into a house that once upon a time on a cemetery. From the moment they move in, they see shadows on the walls, have strange illnesses and the toilet flushes over one million times. After hearing that toilet flush over and over again, I wondered why Jean didn't go and get her hearing checked or at least go to a psychologist. I mean this woman was obsessed with that toilet and that is what ruins this movie. The movie does have some good parts such as the crow pecking on the window and how the old man looks when he tells them who is buried where. The cat having kittens is pretty gruesome but if you can get past the toilet scenes, this wouldn't be such a bad movie.",
         "This film closely chronicles the haunting in a housing subdivision in Newport, Texas and may be of interest to those with experience of ghosts and those interested in the occult. (The movie Poltergeist is the gussied-up, Hollywood version of the same story.) This film gets the haunting phenomena correct, unlike most Hollywood films about ghosts/poltergeists including shadows and poltergeist phenomena. British television did a short, documentary piece at the actual site on their \"Ghost Stories\" series, entitled \"Real Life Poltergeist\", which can be seen on YouTube. This film is recommended to anyone with an interest in the occult although it may not have enough Hollywood pizazz for those who just want a good scare.",
         "Bathebo, you big dope. This is the WORST piece of crap I've seen in a long time. I have just stumbled onto it on late night TV and it is painful to watch. Really painful. How does something like this get made?? Horrible, horrible, horrible! OOOOOO ..... The toilet is flushing by itself again! Scary toilet! Scary toilet! Scary toilet! 1992 doesn't seem like that long ago to me, but watching this makes it seem like 1952. I mean its horrible. Please don't waste your time on the drivel! Scary old black man telling them not to build the pool in the yard. Scary! Scary! How does this stuff get MADE???",
         "Grave Secrets The Legacy Of Hilltop Drive is not a scary film with no depth not much of a story to it rubbish acting and i don't think much to this film. and one thing GHOST DON'T HAVE SHADOWS Just name some Haunted House films worth checking out Amityville horror 1979 Amityville 2 1982 The Haunted tv-film 1992 The Entity 1981 Giving this film 2/10"
