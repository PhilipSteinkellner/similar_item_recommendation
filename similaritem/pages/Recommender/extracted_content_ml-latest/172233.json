         "As someone who used to work in a telemarketing gig in Las Vegas (two months of my life I would rather forget about), I can tell you that the first half hour of \"The Prime Gig\" is the most realistic look at telemarketing ever filmed. The look, the feel, the characters and the situations all ring incredibly true. One of those characters is Penny (Vince Vaughn), the best salesman in this small time operation. He is the typical big fish in the little pool, but the title promises that he will soon achieve the big time. Of course, he does move on to a \"prime gig,\" and this is where the realism of the movie breaks down. But becoming less realistic doesn't mean the movie becomes less engaging. As much as I enjoyed the first 30 minutes, the last hour is pretty powerful itself. Two things sustain this movie and make well worth watching: First, the acting. Besides Vaughn the cast includes Ed Harris, Julia Ormond, Wallace Shawn and George Wendt. All are excellent. Secondly, at the heart of this movie is a morality tale. Director Gregory Mosher has peered into the depths of the American telemarketing industry. He has looked at the small time operations and the prime gigs. And what he has found is disturbing. He has found a greed that does not care who it hurts. A greed that will rob an elderly woman of her life savings without a second thought. A greed that will rip off employees as easily as customers. The ending of this movie may be predictable, but it is still very powerful. So while others on this site have bashed this movie, pay them no attention. You will love \"The Prime Gig.\" Trust me! Hey, would I lie to you? Just give me your trust, and I won't let you down!",
         "I once worked for an old line telemarketing company. I was the guy who trained sales people, not telemarketers who read scripts. I was also the guy who filled phone dialing consoles with scammers when it came time to bid contracts, scammers being the type of people I could not hire for anything other than contract bids. Scammers are good. If you take a deep breath, they can close a sale on that. So, movies like The Prime Gig and Glengarry Glen Ross are fascinating because, if you pay attention, you'll get to see things that most people never get to see, never mind believe. The Prime Gig is well done and more than real enough for those who like stories about scams. The acting is good and there's an absence of melodrama. Everything is done straight up. Movies like this are difficult to end but here we are given a real life ending. The ending works. The movie works. I very much enjoyed it.",
         "I saw this in the indie channel & it kept my attention all the way, except for the phony love scenes (why does Hollywood always have to make sex look so artificial - doesn't anybody do it out there)? The acting is really terrific, especially Ed Harris & Vince Vaughan. Julia Ormond is OK in a part that looks written for Julianne Moore. The beginning is the best, the middle a bit too set-up, like imitation Mamet, the ending is hopeless. But definitely worth seeing for the acting.",
         "I love watching movies. I work for blockbuster for God's sakes....I watch movies all the time. I thought this movie had a good premise and that the actiing was fine(although not stellar). The thing that bothers me about this movie was the ending...it left too many unanswered questions....to many unknowns....It is good for a bored night when u don't have anything else to do but don't ask questions after it's over because they will be unanswered and unknown...big dissappointment. Overall decent movie but not great. if you can see it for free like I did...it's not a bad way to spend an hour and a half if not...wait till it comes on cable",
         "\"The Prime Gig\" begins promisingly enough as a comedy about telemarketing with wonderful character actors like Wallace Shawn and George Wendt. Vince Vaughn plays the main character, the \"star\" marketer at a two-bit storefront telemarketing outfit where the crammed in workers have detailed cue cards posted on the walls to help rebut the customers' objections. The movie quickly throws in a sub-plot -- Vaughn cajoles the boss to hire his bitter handicapped friend. And then, fifteen minutes in, the movie switches gears completely. The first shop closes up, and Shawn, Wendt, et al are never seen again. Instead, we get a corporate expose about a high roller operator (Ed Harris)putting together a team to sell multi-thousand dollar shares in a purported gold mine. Vaughn is skeptical, but is enticed by the prospect of big money, and his attraction for Harris' protege, the beautiful Julia Ormond. The rest of the film alternates between the Vaughn-Ormond tryst, the high pressure goings on at the telemarketing office, and an occasional foray back to the relationship of Vaughn and his handicapped friend. None of the pieces add up. The ending is forced and almost unbelievable in terms of the character development that preceded it. The acting is fine, but wasted. This is a case where the parts are better than the whole.",
         "Knowing the subject matter of this film - shilling fraudulent \"whatever's\" in a boiler room - I assumed it would follow closely in the footsteps of David Mamet's incomparable \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" (as was the case in the over-hyped and disappointing \"Boiler Room\"). Almost immediately, however, it becomes apparent that such is not the case. While \"GGR\" gave us stark images of the salemen's desperation in the context of their work, \"Gig\" delves completely into the life of Pendleton (Penny) Wise, played by Vince Vaughn. It is in showing the emptiness of his entire existence - and not just his work life - that one can see how susceptible he is to the machinations of the almost mythical Kelly Grant (Ed Harris), and his partner Caitlin Carlson (Julia Ormond). From his shabby apartment to his touching relationship with childhood friend Joel (Rory Cochrane) - who is, in spite of or because of his physical handicap, an even bigger loser than Wise and all of Wise's foundering sales cronies - you know he is destined for littler and worser (hey, if Shakespeare can use it, so can I) things. Wise is, as Grant puts it, \"a big fish in a little pond.\" His ego won't let him believe it, but ultimately experience is a hard teacher. For those who just like Harris' style, you won't be disappointed. And Ormond does manage to sum up far more emotion than she did in the pathetic \"Sabrina.\" But it is Vaughn, as stoic as Sheriff and as cynical as Trent Walker, who draws you into his character and keeps you from guessing too far ahead. The movie is worth watching just for the last five minutes or so, from the time Grant claims, \"I'm not a closer\" to the rolling credits. You'll think about this one for quite a while after viewing. And that's a good thing.",
         "Telemarketeers...just the sound of it makes some of us cringe because not everyone likes those telemarketers to 'harass' us over the phone over something they want to promote on. And when moral questions are being raised about what is right and wrong, it has become a grey area. This is where Penny Wise (Vince Vaughn) has to deal with his own conscience. Scamming people through the phone is what Penny is good at for his job as a telemarketer, and when he was being hired to be part of this million-dollar scam, he was rather being hesitant at first. It's where his conscience starts to collide. Very interesting and quirky look at telemarketers who scam for the sake of money. Vince Vaughn portrayed it that well. Guess I will never see those telemarketers the same way again.",
         "I had no idea what to expect from this movie. It just happened to be on cable and Vince was in it, so I watched. I liked the portrayal of each character in this film. Greed, desperation, betrayal...I found myself disgusted with some of the characters, mainly Julia Ormond and Ed Harris. I can't stand Julia Ormond so to watch her as a conniving shrew was quite satisfying. If you can't stomach the dark underbelly of human behavior,and watching how bad someone can screw over another person, than this film's not for you. At the end I found myself bummed out - but that's not necessarily so bad. You need to be in the right mood to watch this. It's low-key, though not boring and definitely not a 'feel good' film. I can understand how some people didn't like it, but I think Vince Vaughn fans will be happy enough (I'm one myself).",
         "No great lines, no memorable scenes (okay, maybe one with the old lady near the end), no interesting twists of fate, no comments on the human condition. A downer of movie, with unrelentingly unpleasant people being unrelentingly unpleasant. You never get to know any of the people or find out their motivations; just as well. If you're going to rip off David Mamet, you should at least have a real nude scene, not just some steamy pillow talk. Some decent acting (notably Ed Harris) and okay cinematography saved The Prime Gig from oblivion, but I could give it no higher than a 2.",
         "My better half raved about this...'a must see.' I can only say it left me with many unanswered questions. The relationship between Penny and Joel, now that was rather unusual,it didn't seem well developed or explained. I kept waiting for something meatier, but that never came. The acting, as a whole, was creditable, though not stellar. Ed Harris, as usual, gives a star-winning performance, albeit, a rather smallish part. Vince, is, well, Vince. Ms Ormond did okay...I suggest she start taking better care of her skin...looks dry! It is so typical of so many 'other' movies out today...the plot is seen coming a mile away...no real surprises...with one exception: \"spoiler:\"...when Penny is speaking with Evelyn on the phone and visualizes them actually speaking in person...that made this movie worth watching...what a neat idea...that was great. The ending left me with a great big \"?\"...did I miss something??? Maybe I just wanted a little more...all in all, it's okay...not great by any stretch of the imagination...but if you are bored...rent it.",
         "This movie was total crap. I am quite embarrassed that there is record of me having rented this film. I'm a really big fan of Vince Vaughn, but a 5 minute scene of him posing is not exactly what I'd call 'entertaining.' The dialogue was very noticeably forced, and I can actually list porn films with a more intriguing plot than \"Let's take Boiler Room, strip it of all interesting characters, remove any semblance of a plot, and film THAT.\" If you're interested in Julia Ormond love scenes, or have some kind of obsession with that odd kid from Empire Records, this film is for you, but otherwise I suggest consuming a large quantity of painkillers before watching this drivel.",
         "Prime Gig, The (2000) A Conversation with the Devil This film has EVERYTHING to recommend it, and is one of the most thought-provoking films I've seen in a long time. With a careful viewing and attention to the dialogue, much can be learned here. In fact, I will need to watch it a number of times, as there is so much there... just \"skimming the surface\" or bubbling beneath. I wish I could read the dialogue in script form, as it has so much power. Obviously, much attention was paid to the writing of it. This film is truly \"A Conversation with the Devil,\" with an angel at hand... There are so many pointers, yet they are easy to miss... He knows just what your weaknesses are, and plays only to that. Does he succeed in the end? One on-screen example that comes to mind, is something to the effect of (paraphrasing here), spoken by Ed Harris, as the Top Dog: \"I watch TV, not for the shows, but for the ads: the ads are the Truth. I know what you feel, watching all those things you don't have (the fancy watch, the expensive car) and I know how worthless it makes you feel... And I never knew how easy it is to find Peace. Remember Christmas, what was the thing that gave you the most pleasure? Not the bike you got for Christmas or for Hanukah; not the gifts you received, but the Frisbee you bought for your brother and the look on his face when he opened it. That's what you remember.\" Another scene has our scammer asking for `The Truth,' and in response he is told: `She trusts you. Don't disappoint her' and leaves the final decision and `fact-finding mission' up to him. What does he do? Does he trust his `instinct' that he stated at the start? This determines the outcome to our fallen hero, does it not? The Devil never lies to anyone; he just twists or leaves out all of the truth. This is an amazing display for which everyone involved falls for, just like we all do in real life. Yet would `love' make a difference in this world we see on the screen, which is a reflection of the world that we create. We don't know what difference an `expression of real love' would have made, but are left to wonder and perhaps to `try again next time.' How to trust, what to trust, who to trust? What is Real and What is False, and What Difference Does It Make in the End? These are the BIg Questions here. The Devil gives many, many examples of \"trust\" when he falls off the back hoe into the telemarketers arms; he has \"set the stage\" perfectly for the things to come, where nothing is as it seems to be. Just how the Devil operates here. And all are tested; how far will they go in their treatment of others, and this determines their own \"reward\" or their own fate, it seems. We start out with a scammer, who ultimately gets scammed. This scammer has a good side (as do we all?) in that he takes care of a childhood friend who is crippled, and we see the loneliness and heartbreak he goes through as he 'enables\" and \"cares for\" this physically helpless friend. But does his friend take advantage of him; does he take advantage of others, does he ever feel \"love\" for anyone else? He wants the gorgeous girl (played by one of my favorite actresses, Julia Ormond), but when he \"has her,\" what does he do? Would she have acted the way she did, in the end, if he had acted differently? Smashing performance from Ed Harris, as the resident \"Big Dog\" devil. I'll watch anything with Harris in it; in his \"later years\" he is becoming the Clark Gable / Cary Grant of our generation, able to play good guys and bad. Vince Vaughn plays this character perfectly, and my estimation of him has also risen many notches. Will be looking for more work from him. The rest of the cast were perfect (especially the \"lead salesman\" who says \"this is MY house!\") as was the dialogue and direction of this `low -life - low-key\" REAL LIFE film. No \"blockbuster easy-ending\" here; we wander through the world on this incredible journey, looking for love, looking for love, looking for security; we wander through the maze and get blown away at the end. Just like in our own lives, at the end of the days.",
         "Imagine eating an Oreo cookie with the cream filling removed or a jelly donut with the jelly sucked out of it. The cookie sides of the Oreo and the donut itself would still be tasty, but you wouldn't be getting what you wanted or expected out of either. The experience would not be unpleasant, just unsatisfying. The Prime Gig is a film where most of the conflict has been extracted. There are still things to enjoy while watching it, but it's a fundamentally boring story. Penny (Vince Vaughn) is a salesman, currently selling travel packages of dubious legality in a bottom-of-the-barrel telemarketing firm. He's the most successful one in the storefront office, which is a little like being the thinnest fat person at Weight Watchers. The rest of the crew are either desperate losers or bitter malcontents. When that job goes up in smoke, Penny is recruited to work for Kelly Grant (Ed Harris), a legendary figure of somewhat questionable business practices. Grant claims to have a gold mine worth $30 million and needs Penny and a warehouse full of other phone salespeople to get $2.5 million worth of investors to sign on to the project. Penny thinks it's a scam, even after Grant goes to extravagant lengths to prove otherwise, but doesn't care as long as he gets paid immediately for every sale he makes. The tempting presence of Grant's beautiful associate, Caitlin (Julia Ormond), is also on Penny's mind and other, more southern parts of his anatomy. While all that's going on, Penny is also trying to help a childhood friend named Joel (Rory Cochrane). Joel is crippled, lazy, pretentious and self-destructive. Why Joel is all of those things and why Penny makes extraordinary efforts to help him is never explained or even hinted at. After a rough start, Penny begins to rack up sales and boink the hell out of Caitlin. That just goes on for a while, giving Vince Vaughn and Julia Ormond a few decent scenes together and then the story simply swirls down the drain. There's a twist at the end that is pulled off in the most backasswards way imaginable and Penny is left to walk down the sidewalk as the closing credits roll. As I mentioned earlier, there are some good things in The Prime Gig. Vaughn and Ormond are very engaging. She also shows off a breast, which is greatly appreciated. The crew at the storefront, including Wallace Shawn, George Wendt and Stephen Tobolowsky, are very entertaining in their misery. It's also fun to listen to Penny and the rest of Grant's team try to manipulate people into investing in the supposed gold mine. All of that is undermined by the tedious lack of conflict in this movie. Some exists at the beginning, where everyone at the storefront is angry with each other and fearful of losing their jobs. It all disappears when Penny joins up with Grant. There's no meaningful conflict between Penny and Grant, Penny and Caitlin, Grant and Caitlin, Penny and the salesman competing with him to be number one, Penny and Joel, Caitlin and Joel or really any other combination of characters. There's a silly attempt late in the film at inner conflict with Penny, but it's so contrived that no one could take it seriously. The bottom line of The Prime Gig is that you spend the last two-thirds of the movie waiting for anything to happen and nothing does, until something happens at the very end that you knew was going to happen from the first second Kelly Grant was mentioned. This film has a few moments of interest breaking up the dullness, like driving through Nebraska and seeing topless hitchhiker every 150 miles, but unless you've got really long attention span, this movie isn't worth your time.",
         "I love movies that feature clever scams. The cycle started with \"The Sting\" where the audience was no longer in the position of observer but was surprised to find that it had also been conned. David Mamet has often visited the genre with the clever \"House of Games\", the intriguing \"Homicide\", the interesting \"The Spanish Prisoner\", and the very ordinary \"Heist\". Ridley Scott does it justice with \"Matchstick Men\", but not everyone can pull it off as the derivative and self-satisfied \"Confidence\" demonstrates. \"The Prime Gig\" is one that gets it right, and it features Vince Vaughan in a role that stands comparison with his Jeremy Grey in \"Wedding Crashers\". The movie takes a look inside the world of telemarketing. Our worst fears about the industry are realised when many of the techniques are revealed. The ethics of the sales people in this movie seem flexible at best or as one of the characters says, \"The problem with telemarketing is that it is fundamentally evil because it is set up on selling some people some bulls*#t they don't need\". Pendleton 'Penny' Wise (Vince Vaughan) is a hot telephone sales guy. He shares an apartment with his physically handicapped friend, Joel (Rory Cochrane) who he also supports financially. When his current job ends abruptly, Penny gets the chance to work for Kelly Grant (Ed Harris) - a high end operator who is putting together a sales team, a room, to sell shares in a newly discovered gold mine. Although Penny is not as overawed by Kelly Grant's reputation as his colleagues, he has a slow start. Finally, Penny gets into his stride and outsells everyone on the team, earning a fortune in commission. However, he complicates his life and compromises his relationship with Joel when he falls for Caitlin (Julia Ormond), Kelly Grant's girlfriend. Although Grant seems to accept the situation, we begin to wonder if Penny has dialled the wrong number. Ed Harris is superb as usual and Julia Ormond is suitably enigmatic as Caitlin, but this is Vince Vaughan's movie. He lives and breathes his role as Penny. He brings his familiar screen persona to the table - the big, reassuring guy, quick with a one-liner who is not easily fazed. He's the one others look to when things go pear-shaped. However, Vince Vaughan has built a nicely rounded portrayal on that familiar character. Penny does have a conscience, and draws the line at ripping off vulnerable old ladies. He is also loyal to his friends - especially Joel. The movie ends on a slightly ambiguous note. Although Penny thought he had the answers, he learns some lessons about human nature and human greed including his own. \"The Prime Gig\" is a movie that seems to have got lost in the shuffle but it's a great little discovery, and is full of surprises; it's definitely one call worth answering.",
         "This is a great movie with a great cast however Vince Vaughn gives perhaps his best dramatic performance to date. Unlike Will Ferrel, Vaughn can do both comedy and drama. This is a great movie thats shows us the real sleazy and corrupt world of telemarketing. In fact if your a telemarketer watching this film , youll probably be mad since it exposed your corrupt jobs!! lol Vaughn plays Penny Wise, a small but great telemarketer who knows how to con people into making sales for his cheap company. Eventually a bigger telemarketing scheme headed by the character of Ed Harris wants to use Penny's \"skills\" in this area to pull of a Million Dollar scam. Meanwhile Penny's friend is out of work and relies on him for support. Penny is caught in a corner, work with this rich white scoundrels to steal millions and sell his soul to the devil , so to speak, or do the right thing? This a great movie about moral dilemna and what you really do if you really had to put your money where your mouth and live up to your own idealogies. All the performances are great and the movie, doesn't really tell you what Penny's \"final decision\" will be until the 10 minutes he \"goes along\" with the scam and looks like he will do it with the rest of them. Highly recommended.",
         "Do not read these comments past the 2nd paragraph if you haven't seen the movie! So we're walking through Blockbuster right? Through the sea of assembly line movies we come across a Vince Vaughn movie we hadn't seen yet. Amazing. It's like finding the pot of gold. Further examination of the case reveals that it also has Ed Harris & Julia Ormond. Wow! We need to look no further. The cover boasts an unpredictable ending. Sweet! (I never learn) The movie begins and the first few minutes are full of Vince goodness. It was fun seeing George Wendt too! Norm! Ok, I hate telemarketers that call people. It's one thing if you call them but when they call me I long for lightning to hit their phone system and electrocute every last one of them. Vince plays one of these types of bastards and is good at getting people to give up the green. Ok, enough. This is to comment not give a synopsis so let me get to the point. I love a good set up in a movie but 30 minutes is a bit extreme. This movie leaves no surprises. You know every step of the way how it will end and it just doesn't try to make it interesting. The best scene is when Vince is trying to sell the old lady on the investment. The ending left you with the empty feeling that \"Penny\" was feeling. Wonderful. Still, 2 good things do not make a great movie or even a good movie. They wasted everyone's talent and our time.",
         "This is a tough one because I can't really call it a bad movie and it wasn't a great movie, it has a pretty interesting story and a lot of cool stuff in it, but it's REALLY SLOW!!! I kept hoping it would pick up the pace a little, but I was let down, it's VERY slow. This movie reminded me a lot of \"Boiler Room\", which I thought was a much better film, so I'd probably recommend seeing that one instead of \"The Prime Gig\", but don't get me wrong \"The Prime Gig\" was ok in it's own right. But of course if you are a die-hard Vince Vaughn/Ed Harris/Julia Ormond fan, then by all means, see \"The Prime Gig\". The film had some very good acting on all accounts, and like I said earlier, a somewhat interesting story-line. In all honesty, I would put this one off till you have some time to kill, I wouldn't rush out and rent it. But ya know, do what you will. Thanks for reading, -Chris",
         "\"The Prime Gig\" tells of a small time boiler room pitchman (Vaughn) who goes to work for a master telemarketer and scam artist (Harris) and his girlfriend (Ormond). The film is an earnest slice-of-life indie drama which emphasizes character depth over plot with Vaughn at the center as a man in conflict with morality and the demands of his job. Not a \"feel good\" flick, \"Prime Gig\" will appeal most to those who appreciate reality over melodrama and sensationalism. Good stuff with limited appeal.",
         "I saw this movie at the Venice Film Festival because it fit into my schedule; I had no idea what it was about. All I have to say is that I am Vince Vaughn's character in that film is me! The way he looks at the world is the way I see things as well. This could be kind of a spoiler... But in my life, I am so cynical and untrusting, yet I want to believe that things can change, that things will be better. But that will never happen. You can't trust anyone; life sucks and it will never get better. I've always felt that way and this film expresses my feelings completely. I love it.",
         "The film \"The Prime Gig\" is sure to stun you throughout it's ensemble of \"prime\" casting, and \"prime\" story line. In this film, Vince Vaughn plays Penny, an aspiring man that wishes to hit it big with a well known man in the telemarketing world, named Kelly Grant. He finally snags the gold, and promises to himself that he \"wants to make money.\" What Penny doesn't know is that his affair with Kelly's assistant and former lover could and will turn for the worse and bring his life to a stand still. For any Vince Vaughn fans this flick is a must, and for movie-goers period it is a jaw dropper with its fantastic, twisting, \"prime\" ending! It will definately leave you with a \"whoa\"! I gave this movie a 9 out of 10. Buy the DVD! -n8gray315",
         "Very good character development and actual good acting from Vaughn. Without spoiling anything, lets just say the movie blew me away. Not 'Reservoir Dogs' blow me away like in certain scenes, but it certainly laid it on kind of thick. You're kept wondering about that 'angle' :P If you liked Glengary Glen ross, then this is your take :)",
         "...and the protagonist's name is \"Penny Wise,\" should be avoided. Make that banned. As in \"Bandon DeRun,\" for the hero of a rock film. Or, \"Hi Nune\" for a western. Or...you get the idea. This movie is about telephone scams, this review is about movie scams. Viewer Beware!",
         "Vince Vaughn makes a convincing \"trapped looser\" and the frustration emanates off the screen. The love scenes made the ending that much more vital and Julia Ormand is convincingly and sexily enthralling. Had to watch them twice. I saw this on DVD, did not hear of it in distribution and it may have been appropriately sent direct to video by the studio. It's not a BIG picture, but the characters are entertaining (Wallace Shawn, Stephen Tobolowsky, George Wendt, Rory Cochrane, et. al.). Ed Harris, as always, is very good. The coverage in some of the scenes was inadequate to provide enough editing material for smooth scene movement (bedroom scenes). Nice camera work from veteran John Alonzo. The ending left me hanging, but it still seemed like the only finish for this story that made sense.",
         "Picked this one up at the video store last night (hey - a girl's gotta spend a Friday night somehow...) and was pleasantly surprised. I don't think this one ever made it to the big show, but it was pretty good. Kind of reminded me of The Last Seduction. You'll have a good time trying to figure out who's scamming who and how. It's also a must-see if you're a V.V. fan. He's so damn hot in this movie it'll just about make you cry. A couple of scenes had me working the Rewind button so much I was glad to be watching it by myself."
