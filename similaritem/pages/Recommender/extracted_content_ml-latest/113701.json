It may be perfect for those who enjoy a simple fast-paced happy ending. Very little brain has to be exercised to wrap around the theme. This is one of those films where everyone is the good guy. It leaves very little room for any realistic connection. Too much fluff! Too good to be true! It lacks some key elements for a descent field trip into fiction. It's like viewing an episode of Lassie, and maybe not that good! The horse is the best actor in the film, if that tells you anything."],
