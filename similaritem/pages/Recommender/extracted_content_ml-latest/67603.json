         "What's the best way for a bandit to maintain a low profile? How about making noise while robbing a safe, leaving behind an identifying spur, and wearing a polka dot neckerchief. Yakima Canutt is Danti, the Polka Dot Bandit in this 1934 Lone Star Western, but the gimmick is not fully carried out in the film. The central plot involves an unscrupulous town boss Malgrove (Edward Piel Sr.) who schemes to buy out all the local ranchers because of gold discovered in the topsoil (?). John Wayne portrays U.S. Marshal John Carruthers, and he aids a suspicious Sheriff Jake Withers (George pre \"Gabby\" Hayes), who seems to regularly uncover evidence pointing to Carruthers as the Polka Dot Bandit. Eleanor Hunt is Betty Mason, the romantic interest in the film, who brings to the screen a wide eyed silent film appearance. For fans of B Westerns, there's a lot to study in \"Blue Steel\"; for starters, it's interesting to see Wayne's character shoot directly into a crowd to knock a gun out of the hand of bad guy Canutt. This technique is used as late as the 1950's in a number of the Lone Ranger TV shows. In another scene, two baddies attempt to get the drop on Wayne's character. As he escapes into a lofty barn, he uses a lasso to scoop up one of his antagonists, but the roped victim never cries out to his partner for help. Similarly, as he engages the other in a fist fight, both remain silent throughout the encounter. Director Robert North Bradbury makes use of an interesting film technique where he fast forwards the motion during an action scene, usually involving riders on horseback in a non threatening sequence. It's effectively done and is also used by director Harry Fraser in some of his Wayne Lone Star films such as \"Randy Rides Alone\". Pay close attention during a chase scene as the bad guy posse pursues Miss Betty on horseback; when hit by a shot she falls to the ground seemingly unconscious, and as she lands she ever so slightly uses her leg to shift position. Within seconds she's scooped up by the vigilant Marshal aboard Gabby's buckboard, and then she miraculously climbs aboard her own horse to once again gallop away - what a gal! By the time it's ready to wrap things up, Marshal Carruthers and Sheriff Jake lie in wait, six guns trained on sticks of dynamite planted in the side of a rock face. As the bad guys make their way into the pass, their fate is sealed under tons of tumbling mountainside. As in so many of John Wayne's Westerns of this era, his character gets the girl without even trying. The scene fades with the marshal and his future bride riding off into the sunset, until it's time to do it all over again in at least another dozen or so Lone Star films.",
         "What a wacky opening scene. The thunderstorm's got to be the loudest on record-- and why is Wayne sneaking into the hotel lobby. I guess he doesn't want to pay for a room. Then there are the newly-weds right out of the aw' shucks school of acting. And most curiously of all-- how did they get the groom's\"I couldn't find it\" snippet past the public watchdogs. This amounts to an astonishing innuendo, and no doubt one for the boys-- in the movie, that is. Probably there are more than a few audience 10-year old's still puzzling over that one. In all likelihood, it was someone's private joke that made it to the screen on a bet. Lone Star popped for some great location photography. The boys get to ride around the Alabama Hills with the scenic Southern Sierras in the background. The story doesn't make a lot of sense, but who cares, especially when the canyon explodes in a really great effect worthy of an A production. Also, some good crowd scenes of ordinary looking people. When they talk about getting forced off their homesteads, I expect more than a few folks in 1934 wished they had a Wayne on their side. As others point out, this looks like an early stage in the evolution of Hayes' unforgettable \"Gabby\" character. He's not called that, still the crusty old coot is definitely coming out. How delightful the Gabby-Wayne pairing proved over the years, especially in their masterpiece Tall in the Saddle. Wayne always seems genuinely amused by the ornery Gabby. Watch some of his reactions here. Those broad grins are not acting. Great final shot that still brings a tear to the eye.",
         "This western was the second significant film in the development of George \"Gabby\" Hayes' cantankerous character who emerged as the old whiskered comedy sidekick in the Hopalong Cassidy films. Gabby plays it straight here as a sheriff who even shoots a baddie. The only \"funny\" things about him are the hole filled hat he wears, his big walrus mustache, & his typical slurred speech. The acting is good all around, except for Eleanor Hunt, who has that cute Clara Bow look, but she's brought that old silent film style to this movie. I love the old B westerns, & aside from my favorite, Hopalong Cassidy, to me the early John Wayne series is the next best. This is not one of Wayne's best, but it's a must-see for Gabby Hayes fans. I rate it 6/10.",
         "Blue Steel finds sheriff Gabby Hayes on the trail of a bandit known as the Polka Dot Bandit by his distinctive polka dot neckerchief. After a robbery at a local hotel, Hayes has reason to suspect a tall stranger played by John Wayne as the bandit. But before he can act on his suspicions both of them get themselves involved in foiling a scheme by a group of outlaws who are starving out a town and they're an especially murderous bunch, attacking supply trains and killing everyone on the trains. It's not too hard to figure out who's behind all this dirty work, especially when you hear one of the town's leading citizens make a 'sacrificial' offer for everyone's land. Wayne and Hayes come to the same conclusion as the audience does and spend the rest of the film foiling the dastardly scheme. Blue Steel has lots of action in it, the action covers up some of the holes in the storyline. The villain also has designs on the daughter of another town leading citizen and Eleanor Hunt plays the daughter in the best Little Nell manner of all those Victorian morality plays. Still John Wayne and Gabby Hayes work well together and it's not the best or the worst of Wayne's Lone Star films.",
         "\"Blue Steel\" is an excellent example of John Wayne's acting talents in 'B' westerns. This was distributed by the ultra-cheap company \"Lone Star Pictures\", even though their pictures were probably made for about $1.50, this is also a good example of what they could do. The story concerns some bad guys who want people to sell their ranches so they can steal the gold that's lying under them. Enter John Wayne. While cheap and stilted, it is entertaining and worth watching.",
         "A fairly involving 'Lone Star' film (even though it lacks enough dialog to provide any character) because of: 1) The opening sequence, with great silences, where we are caught up in John Wayne's mysterious and sudden presence in a hotel during a rain storm, 2) the registering 'bride' and 'bridegroom' at the hotel, shy and secretly excited; later the bridegroom, George Nash in his last film, comes back from the bridal suite saying 'I can't find it.' 3) Yakima Canutt's amazing stunt work-- pulling up a fallen Eleanor Hunt thru the coach horse team, and then helping her onto John Wayne's horse, 4) the extensive final chase sequence, excitingly paced and edited as the bad guys (at least 9 of them) chase our heroes across the vast prairies -- whew! This time, without any preamble of romantic intentions anywhere else in the film, John Wayne and the girl do ride off into the sunset holding hands!",
         "Almost all the Lone Star John Wayne movies have one or two quite unusual and memorable scenes. Here, it is the bizarre opening scene and the beautiful last shot. The opening is actually quite a mess. It takes place in a hotel room on a rainy night and it is hard to tell what is going on for most of the scene. There is also the only risqué double-entendre that I've seen in a Lone Star film when a newlywed husband comes back downstairs from his bridal suite and announces \"I can't find it.\" The ending shot is Wayne riding off into the mountains with his girl and it is just lovely. The confusing and messy hotel sequence in the beginning is atoned for at the end with one of the best final chase sequences in the series. As mentions by other users, the stunt work is excellent and the scene of Wayne picking her his fallen lady from the ground while riding a team of galloping horses is still sweet, if not quite breath-taking. As the ten minute final chase scene is a big element in all the Lone Star Westerns, I would have to rate this highly, although the other 40 minutes does drag a bit. Edward Peil Sr. plays a great villain as he did in \"Man from Utah\". He was in some 375 films in his 40 year career. Yakima Canutt, as usual, is effective as a bad guy too. With a little luck, he would have been as big a star as Wayne. Not the best Lone Star, but it is effective.",
         "\"Blue Steel\" is one of a series of \"B\" westerns made by John Wayne in the 1933-35 period. As with most entries in the series, these Lone Star productions had a stock company all their own. Robert N. Bradbury (father of Bob Steele) directed most of them. The supporting cast usually consisted of George \"Gabby\" Hayes, Earl Dwire and Yakima Canutt playing various roles. A definite asset to the series was Canutt who doubled Wayne and perfected many of his legendary stunts in these films. Unfortunately, he also \"acted\" in many of them. This one starts out amid a driving rain storm. John Carruthers (Wayne) seeks shelter by sneaking into a hotel run by a sleeping Hank (George Cleveland). Also seeking shelter is Sheriff Jake (Hayes) who is after The Polka Dot Bandit. As luck would have it, the bandit (Canutt) robs the safe while everyone is sleeping and Jake sees Carruthers going through the safe after the bandit escaped and thus blames him for the robbery. Jake trails Carruthers to a cabin and is about to arrest him when they hear shots. Now it seems town boss Malgrove (Edward Piel) and his gang are preventing supplies and ammunition from reaching town. Betty Mason (Elinor Hunt) and her father (Lafe Mckee) are attempting to bring in the latest shipment when they are ambushed and the father is killed. Carruthers and Jake rescue Betty and bring her to town where it seems Malgrove has taken a special interest in her. Well, needless to say, Carruthers sorts things all out by the final fade out and everyone except the bad guys, lives happily ever after. Wayne was still honing his skills at this time and it shows at times, but he was getting better with each picture. Hayes played a number of roles in this series from villain to father of the heroine to sidekick to lawman. He had not yet arrived at his \"Gabby\" character although Sheriff Jake was pretty close. Earl Dwire has a minor role as one of Piel's henchmen.",
         "Enjoyed this old time Western from 1934 with John Wayne, (John Carruthers) who sneaks into a hotel during a very bad thunder and lightning storm. The Sheriff, Jake Withers, (Gabby Hayes) gets a room and keeps his eye on a large sum of money deposited in the hotel safe. There is a man named Malgrove, (Edward Peil,Sr.) who owns the town and is a crook and he is trying to tell the town folk about selling their homes, because he knows that a gold mine is under all their homes and he wants to cash in on all the benefits. Betty Mason, (Eleanor Hunt) adds some female charm to the film and John Carruthers falls madly in love with her big brown eyes. If you like classic western films, this is the film for you, the film locations are outstanding for 1934. Enjoy.",
         "The 5th of John Wayne's 14 Lone Star Westerns is nothing if not a lively piece. True, it gets off to a remarkably slow start, but once the bandits arrive on the scene the pace picks up no end. Although the heroine is somewhat lacking in thespian talent, she's pretty enough and has little to do or say anyway. It's Wayne and Hayes who set the action rolling and keep it up�interspersed with some spectacular Canutt stunt-work�right to the finish line. And it's good to see Yakima Canutt in a sizable role on camera as well as doubling Wayne in the action spots. Director Robert North Bradbury has a grand time once the action switches to the wide open spaces. You can virtually see him riding the camera car as it swoops along with galloping-hell-for-leather riders in super-fast tracking shots. And I love those whip pans! Photographer Archie Stout, a specialist in location work, is also most at home with awesome vistas of wide open plains, ringed by rugged mountains and fleecy clouds in the Alabama Hills, Ca."
