Does a good job of being beautiful without trying to be, and is easily my favorite independent film of the year. It is graphic, rude, hilarious, sad, and honest- much like the hand we are dealt in life. The acting is superb, Eleanore Pienta providing a very true turn as a pregnant girl in a world of pressure. Her sister, played by Molly Plunk, is a loving albeit opinionated body in said world while her seething disdain for her mother (an awesome Dana Eskelson) is only countered by the warmth and acceptance of her girlfriend Sylve (top-notch Keisha Zollar). The events that follow these characters and their situations are very real and most people in this world (let alone an audience) can connect to them. Do yourself a favor and see this movie. It might just be the best thing you've seen this year."],
