         "The true story of the Indianapolis is a compelling one of bravery, intrigue, unimaginable suffering and governmental cowardice. This movie never comes close to conveying any of that. It rushes through the set-up, never pausing for us to get to know any of the principals in any depth. The movie can't wait to get to the sharks, but when it does, it almost turns into a comedy of unconvincing action, gaps in logic, ridiculous dialogue and clumsy CGI. Poor Nic Cage is reduced to a near catatonic state, forced into unnatural situations and dubious decisions. In Jaws, Spielberg did a better job in five minutes with Quint's recounting of his Indianapolis experience than this movie does in two hours. A fiasco. McHale's Navy was more realistic.",
         "The single scene in the movie Jaws where Robert Shaw scares the crap out of Richard Dreyfus as he describes the sinking of the USS Indianapolis and the terrifying shark aftermath, has more truth, terror, realism and great acting than the entire movie USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage. This film's amazing true story was hijacked along the way to make room for fictional back lines of power, love and racial tensions that all fall flat. Anachronisms abound--FNG is from the Vietnam war, the neon sign is not of the period, and Wayne Gretzky wouldn't make his \"miss 100 shots you don't take\" quote for another 50 years. It's like the scriptwriter used Google to write the script but forgot to use Google to fact check it. I wanted to like this movie, to pass along a great history lesson to my son watching with me, but from the first wobbly special effect to when we gave up and went to bed as the wrong shark species showed up, USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage never failed to disappoint. At least we know how it ends and at least there's Google to get it right and Jaws to tell it better.",
         "I was really interested in this movie but oh boy, what have these people done? This is one of the worst CGI works I have seen in years, they simply destroyed the movie as a whole. The ship appears washed out, never matches the surroundings. Every action scene is CGI'd, in a cheap way. Scenes on the deck, when explosions happen are clearly fireworks!!! I could not believe my eyes. And some scenes are repeated! I never reviewed on IMDb but created an account just to tell others what a bad work this was. I was really interested in the movie but the lousy work that has been done simply could not pass without being noticed. Watch it and see for yourself. What a disappointment!",
         "The movie just doesn't do service to the real events. If you're really interested in the story just read the Wikipedia page. You'll learn more about the events and it'll save you from wasting 2 hours and ten minutes of your life to this awful movie. I always expect that Hollywood will bungle the details in military movies and usually give them a pass for those. There are SOOO many anachronisms and inaccuracies in this movie though. EVERY scene has something wrong with it. The ship itself, the uniforms, the orders given, the weapons, the lingo, even the sharks. It's beyond distracting. The most glaring example is that they the used a battleship to represent a cruiser. You can have a movie like U-571, which is fictional, and they have more accurate depictions of the submarines and even a German destroyer. Mario Van Peebles is like \"hey, the USS Alabama is located in Mobile, let's go film on that.\" \"It's the wrong type of ship though.\" \"It's only a film based on true events, accuracy doesn't matter.\" On top of that the writers couldn't have stuffed more cliché, trite military lingo into this movie if they tried. The focus they have on the sharks is weird, and inaccurate. The captains speech made me groan out load. Nicholas cage don't ever do another war movie again! If you've seen Windtalkers you know what I'm talking about. Again, if you really want to know what happened to the USS Indianapolis, take 10 mins and read the Wikipedia or better yet go to the library and find a book about it.",
         "Men of Courage is not meant to be anything more than a generic mid- budget war movie with sharks, but it underdelivers even if you keep your expectations low. The script follows historical events pretty closely, but writing has lots of flaws, and romantic storyline is disappointing. Nicolas Cage gives a sensible performance, but his character doesn't move anywhere from \"good captain\" cliché. The writers add lots of voice-over narration to add depth to characters, which makes things worse. The Japanese captain is reduced to ridicule near the ending, where the two captains burst into tears while saluting each other. If you only look for special effects, war scenes and sharks wreaking havoc, this movie won't be any less disappointing. Warship effects are of acceptable quality (for television at least), but man-eating sharks are either roughly made CGI, or replaced with smaller sharks which are obviously harmless. Not a single scene shows sharks biting humans; edits carefully avoid that part. No attention is given to the actual details of shark species present on the site of USS Indianapolis demise. For a movie that closely follows actual events (and even includes documentary footage), Men of Courage has an unacceptable number of inaccuracies. It's also badly edited, with scenes interrupted and tied together in strange places. Two hours last like four. The story of USS Indianapolis appears more fascinating when you read the sources and memoirs, and it certainly deserves a better adaptation than one made by this movie's screenwriters.",
         "Bad across the board. One of the few movies I would really want my money back from. Bad acting, bad plot, horrible cgi, bad script. I really can not find anything positive to say about this film. Even at 128 minutes its was way too long for the lack of substance. There is a scene where McVay speaks to the Japanese Sub Commander. It was pretty schmaltzy, but it had a moment of decent drama when they just looked at each other. I am embarrassed and ashamed that this pile of crud is supposed to reflect on what happened to those men. You are better off reading the book \"In Harms Way\" to get some sort of feel for what they went through. Heck for that matter you are better off watching Jaws and having Quint (Robert Shaw) tell the story about his tattoo, and the story of why he will not wear a life jacket.",
         "An actual true story I was expecting an amazing film but wow was this hard to watch! The start is like something from a cartoon not a big budget film from 2016! some of the scenes looked like props from a school play. terrible acting from all. Look at the scenes from top-gun on the ship real very tense this was more like a local theater show. Completely ruined this story just awful. Id racked my brain to find some part of it that was at least watchable but its really bad the start is just unbearable. Cage is not 1 of my favs but this was a terrible part as its meant to be a tense film but doesn't come close it was actually embarrassing to watch the acting honest I've seen better effects and acting from Sinbad the sailor. I pray that its just me and every one else enjoyed it but not me I'm afraid",
         "Set in mid-1945 during World War II, the USS Indianapolis, led by Captain Charles McVay (Nicolas Cage), was secretly tasked to deliver parts of an atomic bomb (which would later be dropped on Hiroshima) unescorted to a naval base in the Pacific. Back in open sea after successfully delivering their cargo, the ship was torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese submarine in the Philippine Sea. The sailors spent five gruelling days with minimal supplies floating on life rafts in shark-infested waters. Only 317 of the original 1,196 crew members survive the ordeal. The first hour of the film was quite brisk and eventful. The main storyline was laid out within the first scene. The backstory about some of the young sailors were introduced, oddly not too much on McVay himself. The USS Indianapolis embarked on its mission, torpedoed and sunk all within that first hour. However, this meant that the entire second hour would only be dealing about the survival ordeal of the sailors among the sharks awaiting rescue. It got maudlin and repetitive after the first few shark attacks. This was definitely not the war action film people were expecting to see. The actors all seem to have come from the Nicolas Cage school of hammy acting. The major side story was about two friends who were in love with the same girl back home. Another side story was about a couple of sailors, one white, one black, constantly at odds with each other. There was also another side story about an arrogant young officer and his despicable attitude. All these rehashed side stories just served to fill out the rest of the running time before and after the sinking. The best actor for me would have to be Yutaka Takeuchi, the Japanese actor playing court-martial witness Commander Hashimoto, who displayed dignified subtly in his brief role. For its Philippine release, this film's subtitle \"Men of Courage\" was replaced with \"Disaster at (sic) Philippine Sea.\" However, for Filipino moviegoers expecting to actually see some part of the Philippines or see Filipinos in action in this film, they will be disappointed. The Philippines was mentioned but was never actually shown except for scene labels to establish the location. There was an extra card interrupting the closing credits stating how the search for the wreck of the Indianapolis was undertaken in 2001 in cooperation with the Philippine government and National Geographic. That was all about the Philippines here, nothing more. 5/10.",
         "I wouldn't say that you shouldn't watch this film, although, I would defiantly say don't pay money to see it, or have high expectations. The effects were not very impressive, nor the props, sets, etc. it had a fake feeling about it. It was produced to the effect of being historical, but it seemed to skip important points, and embellish others. The story itself seemed to try to stuff in cliché sub-plots, a love story, a racial argument to fit the times, an officer vs. the crew, none of which seemed to fit. I couldn't get over the sharks being mostly great whites, when it is widely regarded the sharks were whitetips; I guess not as scary in Hollywood? The shark scenes themselves were reminiscent of a scifi movie, less the comedy, well it was comedic, depending on which light you see it in. I really won't touch on the acting, they made it on set, they acted, that's about it. It wasn't the worst film ever, but it could have used more heart, and less cgi great whites jumping out of the water, or maybe a whole lot more, and they could have called it USS Indianapolis vs. Jaws, in which case I would have scored it a 4 not a 2.",
         "To my surprise I was actually enjoying the movie. I did not put up too high expectation as I was not sure what the movie was all about and as I said, there were not a lot of star power (except Nicolas Cage who sometimes can play in good movies, but sometimes not too good). This movie was not a war movie where you would be bombarded with the scenes of war through out the whole film. Instead it was more like a survival drama movie, with the war as background. The focus of the movie were on the crew of USS Indianapolis as well as the captain. Watching this movie made me read more about the history of Captain McWay (yes you can read in wikipedia about him as this film was based on true events and quite honoring the actual events). It was sad seeing his life story but also glad at the end. The movie had a lot of touching moments especially when they relate to those crew and the captain. The relationship between the crews, the sacrifice and even the love triangle between Bama, Mike and Clara were also nice to see. This movie was not having a large budget like other blockbuster movies and therefore please do not expect very high tech special effects. But that was not the main attraction anyway. So if you are looking for the kind of war movie with war scenes and cool special effects, perhaps the 2001 movie Pearl Harbor may suit you better. But if you are looking for a survival drama, then this one would totally be satisfying. In addition to the touching moments, there were of course some fun moments and suspenseful moments at the sea involving sharks. Those definitely made the audience (including my wife) screamed at times. Overall, I think this movie is worth to watch. This prove that it does not have to have a high budget to produce a good movie. But then again, this is my personal view. As usual, people may not be able to appreciate certain movies which other found entertaining and vice versa. For my complete review, pls read in michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",
         "This horrific true story about the sinking of a WW2 ship on a secret mission delivering atomic bomb parts has been done before in a miniseries but I enjoyed this one more. There are some faults with the story clichéd characters like the unlikeable captain and choppy editing and slightly cartoon like visuals but the story is so good that it is worth watching. There is a rather clichéd love triangle but I think Michael Bay's Pearl Habour was more annoying. The racial element to the story seems a bit forced. Where it needs to succeed, the movie succeeds. The plot is clearly told - sometimes obviously so. The characters are quite defined so you don't feel confused among the different characters - that helps a lot. The cast is likable enough and there is a connection to the characters. The sinking doesn't look too big budget but it's quite scary. The horrific shark experience in the water is handled well so that thing are tense and not repetitive. The deaths and rescue are surprisingly emotional. The infamous subsequent trial and court martial are shown but would have liked a bit more detail about the scapegoating. Some of the Japanes point of view is shown. Liked the postmortem at the end. The acting is fine and doesn't depend too much on Nicholas Cage. The supporting cast are okay with appearances from Matt Lanter of 90210 and Paul Walker's brother Cody. I would ignore the bad reviews and small opening and lack of marketing - this is a surprisingly good movie. Not a downward trajectory for Nic Cage's career as some may feel.",
         "I don't really expect much from Nick Cage these days. I suppose he did OK trying to pull this disaster of a disaster movie through, one which I watched with a sense of hope that it'd be a reasonable nod of respect to those who lost their lives. The first 30 minutes were reasonable fare. Factually accurate and relatively tense. Unfortunately, when the torpedoes hit the Indianapolis, they appear to sink the entire film. From the absurd idea of a great white perpetrating not one, but a series of ever more daring attacks on the stranded, to the horrendous \"CGI\" and cut shots, which are seriously out of light sync and setting. The \"rogue great white\" nonsense has been to done to death. The Shallows, The Reef etc., whilst not exactly exceptional either, do it better. The shark fin sailing past was laugh-out-loud funny, like the fake fin the kids use to scare swimmers in Jaws. The acting was, at best, ropy. The factual inaccuracies were offensive. The shark attack scenes were ridiculous. At least I watched it through, but that's two hours of my life written off as experience.",
         "In time past movies like this would receive the blockbuster push as well as budget. I remember, for instance, the movie Pearl Harbor which had a big release with the current young actors/actresses of the day. Maybe this movie was shelved or something similar which caused it to be delayed until now. I would have thought the film would have come out in the early 2000's on the coattails of the bestselling book \"In Harms Way\" which caused a spike in public awareness of the USS Indianapolis and it's saga. I just get the feeling there was some delay in the big screen story finally being made to which it is sometimes seen in the lesser than current state of the art CGI and even the choice of side stories. In spite of the anything that may have been going on with getting a movie made about the USS Indianapolis I'd say it's better late than not at all. While the big things like the ill-advised decision to not allow a destroyer escort are depicted with truth and realism making the USS Indianapolis a sitting duck for disaster, I'm not sure if the fictional side stories concocted by the writers add as much? All in all even with the lessened production budget I enjoyed watching this movie. Even though he's past his prime, perhaps, Nicolas Cage did an admirable job of giving Lt. McVay that air of a great officer put into an almost impossible situation. It's literally a miracle the ship made the first leg of it's trip to deliver what would be not just a war ending cargo but a new age in which all the world would be thrust into. The crew of the USS Indianapolis deserve a movie to remember their sacrifice and since this is what we have I say see it. It's good enough if not exactly what they deserve. It can't be stressed that the final act of surviving captain McVay was needlessly tragic: the Navy being responsible for one more huge injustice.",
         "I've titled this puzzling and muddled, because it's always 'puzzling' to me how, given the resources they have at hand, some directors manage to produce something of such poor quality. 'Muddled' because the screenplay jumps from theme to theme and scene to scene with no obvious logic. The film starts creditably enough with some basic character building - suitably gung-ho or sensitive crewmen, the respective American and Japanese captains with their professional concerns and personal issues, and there's a generic love story thrown in. It is difficult to go much further without plot-giveaways, but from then on the film descends into something resembling a collection of out-takes from Titanic, Pearl Harbour, Moby Dick: 2010 and The Hunt for Red October. The recreation of the Indianapolis is impressive, 'photo-relistic' initially, but the money or enthusiasm for quality CGI seems to have rapidly run out, because thereafter the ships and sharks move about obviously too fast, too slow or with peculiar quirky motion. The Indianapolis's angles as it is sinking change repeatedly, one moment it has tutned almost upright in the water, the next it is at barely 30 degrees from the horizontal. The actors, including Cage, give reasonably competent performances, but as another reviewer has already said, the whole caboodle would have fared better as a TV movie without big-screen pretensions. So, sorry everyone, while it has a promising opening, the quality of the production then drops rapidly.",
         "I for the life of me, do not understand people handing out bad reviews for movies that are quite good. It's as if people have nothing better to do than to act negative to fellow human-beings. I really enjoyed this movie. I was interested from the get-go. Very well-written story, and excellent acting by all who was cast in this film. Nicolas Cage and Tom Sizemore were brilliant as always and the rest of the cast as well. Keep in mind Nicolas and Tom are Oscar caliber actors, Nicholas Winning one and Tom Sizemore should have got a nod for Saving Private Ryan, I thought he stole many scenes in that movie. Anyway, this is a story long overdue and I'm glad someone finally told a great story of it. Very good directing! Thanks to all who took part in this film, I truly appreciate the effort and applaud you and this awesome film!",
         "I have been waiting for a long time for a feature film to be made on this tragedy (There was a TV movie, Mission of the Shark). My grandfather was one of the survivors so I have some emotional ties, but I will not let that sway my opinion. This movie is NOT as bad as a lot of these reviews make it out to be. I think people complain just to complain about movies and Nicolas Cage and they don't look at these films objectively. One reviewer mentioned all of the factual inaccuracies but fails to mention any of them. The movie was based on Doug Stanto's 'In Harms Way' and from what I know, it and the film stick to the main facts. The CGI was pretty bad in some spots, but that is a limitation based on budget. There were some unnecessary subplots such as the love triangle, which seemed to be a complete ripoff from Pearl Harbor. Some of the scenes were drawn out a little too long, especially when they were in the water, but I think they really wanted to demonstrate in a 2-hour film just how long these guys were in the water...four and a half days is a long time. All things considered, this film is worth watching for sure. Go into it with the attitude of learning about this tragedy and not expecting to be blown away with special effects and terrific acting. I think if people do that, they will appreciate the film much more.",
         "The USS Indianapolis was one of the Navy's older Cruisers and served with much distinction. My Ens. David A Jump was a crew member on the ill fated Indy. The movie story is pretty much the way we were told as to what happened to the ship and the crew. My uncle died aboard the ship with the 1st torpedo attach. The story about what happened to Cpt. McVay is very real. The Navy didn't let the families know what really happened so many people hated Cpt. McVay and blamed him for the loss. The movie has historical value. It is well documented that the Japanese Commander did testify at the trial and he and McVay did meet each other. The loss of the Indy crew should never have happened. The Navy should have had better contact with the ship and when it didn't arrive at the next stop, the SOS should have been looked at much closer. It was known that the Japanese sub was in the path of the USS Indianapolis.",
         "i really enjoyed this movie, though im not a fan of nicolas age, non the less, he did a great job. and thank god i didn't read the review before watching this movie, the plot is good, historical enough, and very important in shading the light on this important case of history where the hero was murked or oppressed, this was just what i didnot expect. i can say that i enjoyed with emotions in this movie better than the stupid suicide squad. if u a history fan, or interested in good written and executed cinematic work, then this movie is for u, and also it is a re- watchable movie, to put in ur collection. don't read other review who suggest otherwise, watch the trailer, read the summary, watch the movie and form ur own opinion about this movie. enjoy. regards.",
         "It starts off hard, with heavy action and glorious CGI effects, like a James Bond movie. Japanese Zeros crashing on the deck as Cage directs the gunners to defend the ship. Then it goes limp after the first minute... bring those pills back, damn it! \"Tora, Tora, Tora\" and \"Midway\" for their time were far more ingenious, going so far as to use radio controlled model airplanes for most the stunts. In a later scene, a Jap sub just pops out of the water..... PLOOP!!! No splash at all, no water displacement, no slow motion while surfacing.... just PLOOP! $40M, huh? I truly BELIEVE these big budgets are really fronts to launder drug money by Hollywood, HOW you blow $40M and get such cheesy visuals is amazing to me! Too bad Carrie died, bet she could tell us. WHY do they have to COPY what's already been done to death and stick a half-arsed romance in the middle of rockets and bombs? I'm a pilot, so I like Warbirds, aircraft and aviation. I also LOVE pussy. Yet I know for a fact we pilots NEVER bring our women out to the airport, that's like sticking your pecker in a meat grinder! What is it with these Hollywood Crackheads anyway, huh? And it's ALWAYS a war movie that takes place in the Pacific which has the romance, never in Europe or the western front, maybe Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn! Nick Cage makes CRAP anyway.... where's the scene with him on a Harley with a flaming skull, barreling down the road after vampires or demons? OH... that's in the sequel! Queue the sharks.... a whole hour of that.... YES, AN ENTIRE HOUR.... which I skipped to see Nick put a bullet in his head for his failed career.",
         "This is based upon a true story In 1945 the USS Indianapolis was on a secret mission to deliver the Atomic Bomb to Tinian Air Base in the Philippines. The ship was to go and return without escorts (to handle enemy subs). The USS Indianapolis was sunk on the return and the crew was in the water for 5-days without food, water and with hungry sharks all around before they were rescued. There is a court-martial afterwards. (Whaaaaat?) Most of the movie shows the crew of the USS Indianapolis in the water waiting to be rescued and trying to stay away from the sharks and that was not all that easy. The CGI and camera work were spectacular and we found ourselves jumping more than once when sharks attacked. We see red in the water but there is nothing gory seen. (And that was a good thing) There was too much screen time of the men in the water and let's face it there was too much repetition with these scenes. We could have seen more story in the courtroom later on. I was surprised at the amount of water in those rafts and there was no effort to bail that water out. Maybe those rafts were built like that. Who knows? There were a couple mini sub-plots: two sailors in love with the same girl and two sailors fighting each other on land and need to learn to survive in the raft. But did we care about any of this? Of course not. There was no real character development as the emphasis was on the crew stranded in the water and later the court-martial. Notables: Tom Sizemore as Petty Officer McWhorter; Currie Graham as Capt Ryan a lawyer at the court-martial; and Yutaka Takeuchi as the Japanese Commander Hashimoto who sunk the USS Indianapolis and he gave the best performance. The acting was okay, sparse but okay and it got better at the court- martial (Whaaaaat?) To be honest I was completely surprised there even was a court-martial. The Nicolas Cage Impersonators didn't really have much to go on in here as Mr. Cage played it too straight. (As he should have) The ending is very surprising and it may even make you angry. Watch the statements at the end to see what happened to some of the survivors and how an injustice was corrected. (7/10) Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Small stuff only and not much of it.",
         "Before I say anything critical of the film I have to admit; it's about damn time someone has attempted to tell this story. With that said, time to get a little critical. First, if you are a Cage fan like me, this film does not get Cagey. Nor should it. This is a restrained role with Cage sharing screen time with many characters throughout. I feel like this film has many components, or parts - some hurt it while others help it. It has the generic feel of Michael Bay's \"Pearl Harbor\" to introduce the characters and plot; while I didn't care for that film I know many do - yet for me, this hurt. Second, many scenes with sharks are no better than a Sci-Fi Channel-made shark horror TV movie; it is sensationalized and way over-the-top (including the inclusion of great white sharks not even present at the actual event). A better way to have depicted it would have been to focus on the suspense of the sailor's predicament, the emotional impact, and the effects of exposure and dehydration. Obviously, this really hurt the film in my eyes. The last component I see in this film is that it does have elements that remind me of an Eastwood film - a la \"Flags of Our Fathers\" and \"Letters From Iwo Jima\"; these reminders are few in number but do strike emotionally deeper - in particular the face-to-face between McVay and Hashimoto. See, for me, unrealistic shark attacks and run-of-the-mill storytelling don't pique my interest - make me feel something and you win me over. This film scores a 4/10 on that scale and receives another 2 on top for even addressing the fate the USS Indianapolis and her crew - in particular the fate of Rear Admiral McVay. Would this film have been worthy of seeing in theaters? No. But it definitely is worth a rent or having up your sleeve when other options aren't available.",
         "I wasn't attracted by the so called A lister Nicolas Cage as I think he's overrated and inconsistent. I fancied the film because of Tom Sizemore as he doesn't usually appear in poor movies. However I'm not sure what went wrong but both were badly directed, and ended up acting like second rate amateur drama actors, along with most of the rest of the cast. The story is interesting especially as it's true, although there's been not much of an attempt to stick to real military principles so it takes away some of the authenticity. However while the story is interesting it's badly told with poor acting, uninteresting dialogue and poor direction. Special effects aren't great. Not that the movie was supposed to be about special effects, but the simple launching of a torpedo has been around in Hollywood for decades, yet even that was almost cartoonish. Poor effects and poor dialogue and poor acting and that godawful music which was totally out of character for the movie means there was no real emotional impact for most of the movie. It has been said that due to it's low budget people ought to have a lower expectation of this film. However, it cost $40 million to produce. Get your head round just how much money that is...$40 million, for that amount of money it should be slick and polished and well acted. I gave this film 4 and 1 of those points was for the memory of the real men who were on that ship. Personally if you like a good story...I would avoid this film. You're really not missing much.",
         "I struggled to stay with this film from the first historically inaccurate portrayal of officers on deck in battle, without the proper gear, shouting fire at each target to the horrible CGI and sparse sets. The CGI was actually worse than many video games. The life rafts look like they were salvaged from a war 60 years ago, not off a ship of the line of the US Navy in 1945. I actually at one point questioned when Nicholas Cage decided to to do a 'made for TV' movie. The true historical story is fascinating drama, this film is a shadow of that story that is not worth the viewing. I tried to hang in to see the stranded at sea play out only to continue to be disappointed by the unrealistic shark sequences and a wounded sailor gratuitously holding a segment of his severed leg, shoe attached and all, through far too much dialog. Cage's performance was if he knew all this during the filming and just wanted to get it over with. Now I know what critics call, phoning in a performance. The Indianapolis was sunk by the CGI, script, directing and budget. I so much more enjoyed reading the story in wiki and listening to the story told by Robert Shaw's character Quint in Jaws.",
         "I was surprised that there is a HD version available through the Kodi streaming platform in the Exodus app. It is the Russian titled copy, but is English language. The front story does make you realize that it is not about Nicholas Cage, but more about the crew of the Indy and the captain of the sub that sank her. Script was thought out for the characters pretty good, with typical Navy Romance (Sailor brings friend to visit someone, friend meets girl, friend asks girls to marry him before going out on deployment). You can easily tell that the CGI scenes are not the best thought out part of the movie. They do tend to make it cheesy in that part. It is almost like you are watching a Military History Channel documentary of a battle. The biggest failure that is typical of any Navy show or movie, is that there is barely no crew in the scenes and way too many higher enlisted and officers."
