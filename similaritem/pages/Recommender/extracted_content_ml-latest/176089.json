It runs for 4 minutes and does not feature the colorful shapes from the first, but instead the animation is slightly better in terms of shapes and movements. I thought this one starts slowly, but becomes an acceptable watch around the 1-minute mark. Still, it is not on a level that I would recommend it, but there is also worse stuff out there, especially from around that era. Nonetheless, it was still a long way to go for animation, especially in Germany which still has not really been outstanding ever unfortunately and always far far behind the American efforts. I cannot recommend \"Opus II\"."],
