         "I was able to guess the ending within the first half hour. This was just a very bad movie . The jokes were lame, the characters were not likable at all. The only welcome character in the movie was Vincent Pastore aka Big Pussy from Sopranos. Even the couple of scenes he was in could not save this movie. It was one of those movies where everything goes wrong. Like this has not been done to death . Very juvenile and watchable in the sense that you can not believe how bad a movie you are watching. Just when you think the movie can not get any worse it surprises and it does. In my opinion the best part of movie besides Mr. Pastores scenes were the clips that showed the Vegas strip or downtown Vegas.I did not expect much and thats exactly what I got. Kal Penn already has a slew of these movies with those White Castle flicks. I wonder if this guy has any acting range at all. Than again white castle burgers are small and evidently so is Kal Penns acting range. If you must watch this please watch it on cable already paid.",
         "A very funny movie. It is a movie about five best friends taking a trip to Vegas to say goodbye to one man's single life forever. They think this trip is all about \"stretching their morals,\" getting wasted, watching hot women (maybe even participating), and remembering (or not remembering) this as the best weekend of their lives, but the party planner has much more in store for them. You will not be prepared for what this movie has in store, and I recommend you to watch at least the first 45 minutes of this movie because it will have you cracking up with laughter. I guess you can kind of compare it to \"Harold and Kumar go to White Castle,\" just because you never know what is going to happen next. I wouldn't call this movie a \"must see,\" but I will definitely call this movie funny and entertaining and something you should get if you have seen everything else.",
         "Vegas Baby (2006, Dir. Eric Bernt) Nathan (Bennett) is getting married and he's left his four friends to plan his bachelor party. But what Z-Bob (Penn) thinks is a fool-proof plan to a wild night in Vegas, ends up as a chase across Vegas in what would be a weekend they would never forget. Vegas Baby really tries hard to be a truly funny comedy film, but falls flat most of the time. There are jokes placed around, but these come mostly from Lin Shaye (who shows more than needs to be seen) and the unknown Himelstein. The main comedic draw of the film, Kal Penn fails to present any funny jokes at all, that he is known for. I'm Cassandra. I also teach preschool. � Cassandra (Lin Shaye)",
         "I watched this film with no expectations!!. That's the key to enjoying movie's like these. Really enjoyed it and so did my friends. It's a Bachelor Party Movie (no donkey snorting coke this time). So you would think it's in the same spirit as a National Lampoon Movie. If you want to watch a film where you don't have to think, just RELAX and Laugh this is the film for you!. Seem's to me a lot of people being hard on it, or did they expect it to be a documentary of Bachelor Parties?. Too much Reality Show's on already In my opinion. I would watch again and will purchase. I liked seeing some familiar face's and some new face's that did a good job.",
         "The guy who plays Kumar Stars. That sort of tells you everything. A colorful movie that is dumber than you can imagine. truly the worst most absorb lower than low jokes. Nobody talks like this. Here's the \"plot\". Nathan is getting married and he's left his four friends to plan his bachelor party. But what Z-Bob thinks is a fool-proof plan to a wild night in Vegas, ends up as a chase across Vegas in what would be a weekend they would never forget.",
         "Of course I already had the bar quite low for this movie, expecting a good crude humour comedy, may be even a bad crude humour comedy but still enjoyable. Why? I like Kal Penn and the Harold and Kumar movies, I even liked Hangover, so in a streak of retrospect to Hangover and respect to Kal Penn I decided to rent this DVD in 2014. I regretted I did it. I never imagined that such senseless script could exist. Hopeless zero talented directing to boot as well. Kal Penn wouldn't have helped his movie even if he was a living deity of acting. The stop button took action in about 15 minutes from the start of Bachelor Party Vegas. You've been warned. Stay away from this junk even if you like below the waist humour and Kal Penn.",
         "A lot of people have made terrible reviews on this movie, but I think people have just watched the movie with their expectations low and have just watched it to criticise it and to pick out all the bad bits, but the things they missed were the good bits. This movie is entertainment through and through, its quick paced, its got good actors and its got a good story. The only thing that let it down was the script, (which luckily enough was pepped up by the actors) and the other thing that let it down also was the over use of half naked women. I'm not saying there shouldn't have been any, I understood there was going to be quite a lot, it being a bachelor party and all, but you know it's gone too far when you begin to feel uncomfortable watching it by yourself. There seemed to be a hot girl round every corner and they kept popping up in the most bizarre places... but that's my only criticism It's a fun movie, which takes you on an entertaining adventure with these five guys, all of whom have very good characters. Some jokes made by them did just pass by me, but I did smile and laugh at some others, which I think is a huge accomplishment for a movie, because I know there are some big Hollywood comedies out there, which people don't laugh at, yet they're big movies. Also, the reason some of the jokes aren't so funny is not because they're bad jokes, it's because they just glaze over you. But when watching this movie look out for the character Eli, played by the talented actor Aaron Himelstein, he's the one that makes you laugh and the majority of the funny jokes come from him and his awesome nervous character. I liked the ending, simply because as the movie was getting closer to the end they gave you enough clues to guess what was going to happen, so therefore it was less disappointing than it could have been. The ending was also well explained, rather than it being a simple, unexplained twist, it actually had a nice story behind it and it made you smile. This is a movie that I would have probably enjoyed a lot more if I hadn't of read all of the terrible reviews, simple because no movie can be enjoyed when you know the bad bits that people have found. I'd say the only down fall was the over use of sex and gross out humour, which I don't particularly mind in a movie, but in this movie it just lasted a bit too long. Over all, I was entertained, I enjoyed it, which in the end, is all you want from a movie. So ignore the bad reviews, and try and forget about them when you watch this movie, because it really isn't that bad, it makes you laugh and smile and has a good story and good actors, which is all I wanted from it.",
         "I would've figured this to be just another lame joked Bachelor Party movie. Well it was pretty lame when it tried to be funny, but it actually had an excellent story if you can believe it. I wouldn't technically call this a comedy movie, because it didn't make me laugh at all. But this is a pretty decent adventure movie with a fantastic story to it. You may feel let down because the movie did pretty horrible, but if you watch the entire movie and follow the story you will find it to be a little better than the story of comedies that have made it big at the box office. I thought the movie was a little overboard with trying to be funny and all, but once again the story and plot is the only thing that can save it. 4/10",
         "Although I practically live on IMDb, I've never written a review before. I have good taste but am not afraid to watch a good, tacky, prepubescent T&A flick. However, I feel I owe it to humanity to warn the rest of the world how awful this movie is. I went to the video store to rent the original movie which I caught the last half of on cable not too long ago and loved (which shows I'm not some high-brow snob). Unfortunately, they don't carry it, so I decided to try this POS instead. I'm not going to waste considerable time to write why this movie sucks so badly. Just take my word for it and do yourself a favor, forgo this movie, and rent the original 1984 \"Bachelor Party\". I think someone should refund my money and pay damages for the pain and suffering I endured watching this movie.",
         "Rated R for strong sexual content and humor including dialogue, nudity, language and some drug use. While this rating and the DVD cover of this movie may make the so called lovers of cinema , wriggle their noses, ITS EXACTLY THE KIND OF RATING I LIKE MY MOVIES TO HAVE. So trust me when I say, I AM THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR SUCH FILMS. That being said I'm not a big fan of direct to DVD movies, if the movie isn't good enough to see in the theaters there's no reason it should be good enough to see on the TV. But still THIS MOVIE HAD ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS I LIKE IN A COMEDY MOVIE AND KAL PENN. So I rented this movie but automatically lowered my expectations. The movie started with promise with a hilarious joke on the racist nature of airport security, immediately the Multi-cultural nature of the cast struck me A black, A nerd, A fat guy , A Normal White Guy in Love, an Indian.......... no rational mind can accept this scenario and its been clearly done to increase the range of the audience as much as possible. The movie had crude jokes, nudity, hot chicks, ugly chicks , fat chicks, Gay jokes but somehow I was hardly laughing, I even remember most of the jokes but I seem to recall laughing only for a couple of them namely the Airport Security one, the Porn Set, the hotel entry etc. THIS IS A PERFECT CASE OF GREAT JOKES GONE WRONG. We all know a jokes is not all about its content but on its execution and this movie has clearly gone wrong there. The background score was in fact quite good WHEN IT WAS USED, this movie completely forgot that sound effects can be used in films.The opening sequence was a great example of this. The acting was in fact very good, the characters may have been stereotypical but the actors displayed their acting talents in the limited premise that was given to them. For me the winner was the nerdy guy who would do the most nerdiest things possible in all situations. Script writing and direction are never fortes of such films and were not worth mentioning here either. Towards the end the movie tried to be something its not, IN THE MOST PREDICTABLE MANNER POSSIBLE and it was the looser for it. For a moment this movie felt like a Chick Flick. The only thing nagging me was that I saw the movie with the wrong company, and MAYBE ON A BETTER DAY THIS MOVIE COULD HAVE MADE ME LAUGH, given the potential of the jokes. But even then being a lover of such films this should have been a mere triviality. All in all a ordinary film which wasted its potential and failed in execution. THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THIS MOVIE MAY MAKE YOU LAUGH (more than a a couple of times) BUT THE CHANCES ARE LOW. Worth a miss.!!! +s great jokes, good acting, a few well executed scenes +/-s may be able to make you laugh if you like such movies (a gamble) -s bad execution, tries to be what is not (unsuccessfully and predictably), no sound effects. total 4.5/10 (factoring in Made for DVD and bad company)"
