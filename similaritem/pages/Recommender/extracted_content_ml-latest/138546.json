         "When we rented this DVD (under the name \"A Bet's A Bet\") last month, we didn't know what to expect. What a pleasant surprise! This movie is a riot! Geoff Stults as Vince (competitive attorney and ladies' man) kept us laughing for 90 minutes! His lines and his point of view regarding women and life are hysterical (and not typical). The scenes where he is hanging out with his male friends are hilarious - all his friends are funny! Vince meets his match when he meets Jane (Mena Suvari) and she is great! She is perfect in this movie! Another pleasant surprise in this film: When conversation became more serious (between Vince and Jane), the actors and lines were believable and not corny or clique like so many male-female love stories. We enjoyed this movie so much, we are going to buy it online. It is definitely the kind of comedy we will watch again and again!",
         "How can a man be the best divorce lawyer and in his personal life to be a complete idiot? Because he has 3 other friends as goof? No, just to be in another film full of talk (quite naturally by the way), and finally to turn into a loving and understanding man, to defend the interests of the woman which, he says, would be in love. I wanted to see this movie for Eric Roberts, he is the most famous of all the cast, an actor with many interesting roles in previous movies, excellent in \"Runaway Train\" (1985) directed by Andrei Konchalovsky. But big disappointment, Eric appears only about two minutes in the whole movie, just a very small role. And even bigger disappointment, the film is an absolute total waste of time. Words, words, words, only babble. Or makes you sleep, or makes you want to end sooner.",
         "How is it that we are still making jokes about fat people? I had to turn this movie off after the scene where both Mena Suvari and that other unknown guy make a bet to talk to the lady in the bar and her FAT friend. Would we all be okay with that joke if the fat lady had cancer? what about if she had anorexia instead? Obesity is a disease people and it is linked to many other heath problems, for example; diabetes. The more we make fun of it the less we take it seriously. How about we stop making fun of fat people and start treating them as human beings who have a HEALTH PROBLEM. Its not funny, it is very serious, and the more we make fun of it the more stress we place on our health systems. Lets not treat it as something that is comedic, lets look at it as a serious problem - not something a comedian uses as a gag."
