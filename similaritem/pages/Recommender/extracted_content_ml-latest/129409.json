         "Here we see once again how it is possible to make a movie with a classic scenario and turn over the whole genre. The musical/college style was revisited by french comedy and turned into a cynical parody of rivalry at American High Schools and its consequences. Although these consequences are clearly overdone, and arguably at some points the directors went even over that limit ----SPOILER ALERT!!!---- //don't read any further if you don't want your movie experience to get ruined// when alleging to Kennedy's Assassinate or when turning towards black humor,----END OF SPOILER---- it is characteristic of what makes french comedy: not to be afraid of exaggerations nor of political (un-)correctness. I do recommend this movie to anyone, with a slight preference to people familiar with the french language and its expressions. Indeed, a lot of jokes are about french/English language mix-ups who might appear boring or unoriginal to those who can't identify with their subtleties. 8/10",
         "This feels like the love child of Grease and terrible humor that no one could possibly find funny. In all honesty at first I thought I was watching a bad C grade kid's movie, but it was far, far worse than that. Everything from the middle aged women playing teenagers, to the overuse of the word \"Foon\", was just, well, horrible to watch. It honestly made me question French comedy as a whole, is this really the kind of crap they intend to put out for the rest of eternity? SPOILER ALERT: But don't worry, I'm just saving you the trouble of watching this piece of- well yeah, you get the point. Alright, so like many other high school movies, this is about geeks and ugly people overcoming the popular kids (known as \"Foons\" in this movie?), but the catch is, the popular kids are in fact ugly too, and terrible actors at that. So out of the popular \"Foons\" you've got your 2 big breasted middle aged females playing teenagers and, you have your typical Travolta-type character, but here's where it gets interesting. You've got a Hispanic guy who thinks hes Elvis (to make matters worse, he actually sings like Elvis, but in French later in the film, possibly the most horrific thing I have ever seen.) So all in all, a bunch of stuff happens, and they all end up killing each other, which may sound interesting, but trust me, its not. at all. if you value yourself in any way shape or form, do not ever see this movie, ever. I don't care how bored or stupid you are, just don't see it. 0/10, and that's being generous."
