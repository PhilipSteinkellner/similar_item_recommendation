         "First off, I saw the Italian version of Pinocchio, subtitled in English. After watching the Italian version on DVD, we decided to switch to the English-language track to hear what it sounded like. It was like fingernails on a chalkboard...As unprofessional as watching a dubbed Godzilla movie. Anyway, after hearing all the incredibly negative press about this film, I'm not sure why we rented it. But when my family got a free rental, we decided to choose a movie that we wouldn't actually pay money for...and we chose Pinocchio. First of all, the movie is certainly not an excellent, 5 star affair. But it is a decent film that entertained the three of us for close to two hours. Strong Points- Technically speaking, the film is beautifully made with beautiful sets, cinematography and scenery. These are not enough to entertain anybody but the most pompous film critic of course. The best part of the film for me, was the very faithful adaptation of the original classic story (foolish American audiences may say too dark...and yes, I am an American). It brought back fond memories for all of us, of the original story we had enjoyed as children. And Kim Rossi Stuart as the doomed Lucignolo (not Leonardo) is charming. Weak Points- Well, as many commenters have noted, Roberto Benigni is simply miscast in the role of Pinocchio and the sight of a 50-year old man playing a little boy does get annoying. But even so, he's not half as bad as they say he is. All in all, it's an entertaining, if average, film as long as you have the brain cells to read the subtitles. Just a quick trivia note....one of the reasons the English dubbing is so bad (in my opinion) is that it was incredibly rushed. Benigni was supposed to dub his own voice, but dropped out at the last minute and was replaced my Breckin Meyer. By this time, the US release date was fast approaching, the film was directed at a childrens audience and the studio felt it couldnt release a childrens movie with subtitles. *** 1/4 stars.",
         "First a warning - do not watch the dubbed release of this film - it's terrible. Watch the original Italian version with English subtitles - it makes all the difference in the world. Visually stunning while only partially flawed by Benigni's casting of himself in the lead role (you have to like him to like the movie), this film is wildly entertaining - more in the vain of Terry Gilliam's The Adventures of Baron Munchausenthan the Disney classic Pinocchio.",
         "I'm Italian and i know perfectly the book \"Pinocchio\" and the mentality in which it had been written,because it's my mentality too. Now, just the fact that Pinocchio is played by a 50 years old actor that says lines with a false child's voice,should make you feeling a little strange.The blue Fairy is played by an actress(?) that never changes expression,but she's Pinocchio-Benigni's wife,so everything comes clear.Moreover,the entire movie is cold,just a collage of episode based on the book. It's sad that the most expensive Italian movie is such a bad one. Benigni is a great actor and why,WHY after a poetic masterpiece like \"La vita √® bella\"(Life is beautiful) had to ruin himself with such a crappy movie??? If you want to see a movie based on Collodi's book really faithful to the Italian spirit, you've to watch \"Le avventure di Pinocchio\" by Luigi Comencini.THAT is the real story beloved by people in Italy and all over the world.",
         "I must admit I admired the set designs and the effects of this film, which were quite colorful and entertaining. The film started well and I settled in expecting to be amazed. Then Pinocchio spoke, and I saw Roberto Benigni as the wooden puppet who longed to be a boy. WOW was that bad casting! I couldn't keep track of the amount of times I winced in pain and rolled my eyes as Benigni, a middle-aged man, ran around like a spoiled brat spouting things many 3-year olds have outgrown. I must admit I wanted to make kindling of this puppet. Worth seeing for the set pieces, costumes and effects. Too bad we can't edit out the parts with Pinocchio! 5 out of 10 (all 5 for the sets and costumes).",
         "i wonder why everyone is insulting this movie.. i think it's a great movie with a beautiful cinematography.. and about the dubbing, i watched this movie in italian with english subtitles, so there's nothing wrong with it.. then the storyline, indeed it's not like \"the usual pinocchio that you've known\", but for me that's the interesting point, the story is a little bit different and we need more imagination in watching the movie since it's lack of special effects, so our imagination is tested, and that's what interesting.. i think it's more like an artistic movie.. in conclusion, benigni has done a great job and pinocchio is not a \"hollywood movie\", so watch it..",
         "I'm an Italian-born longtime US resident, so I think I'm well-positioned to explain this film to the US public :) First and foremost, this isn't just \"a film\" -- it's a \"Roberto Benigni\" film. By that, I mean something analogous to a \"Woody Allen\" film, i.e. a film where the actor/director's imprint is so POWERFUL that you can't separate the two. Imagine considering a \"Woody Allen\" film without taking into account the \"Woody Allen\" part! Well, Roberto Benigni is essentially an Italian Woody Allen -- though, IMHO, less neurotic. LOL My advice: watch other Benigni films BEFORE \"Pinocchio\". I highly recommend the much acclaimed \"Life is Beautiful\", and the much-lighter \"The Monster.\" If you love his other films -- as I do -- you'll do just fine with \"Pinocchio.\" Also try to understand the \"Pinocchio\" story before watching this movie. I grew up with it -- its popularity in Italy is like that of \"The Wizard of Oz\" in the US\u0085 \"Pinocchio\" is a very old-fashioned story, with quaint charm in its heavy-handed moralistic approach. In short, a boy (or a puppet wishing to be a boy) who disregards adult advice will get into all sorts of dire situations. Skip school and get transformed into a jackass! The real charmer is the lively personality of the puppet, and the other endearing characters, both human and magical. Benigni is PERFECT for the role of the boy-puppet. It doesn't matter one iota how old he is; it's not just an \"actor\" -- it's Benigni. Once again, Benigni is THE film in a Benigni film, just like Woody is THE film in his films. Playing a rambunctious puppet is second nature to Benigni!! He's a total natural for that. Foolishly, I was discouraged from watching this fine film by the negative reviews. Don't do my same mistake! BTW, rent the \"Italian version\": it gives you A CHOICE between Italian, English and French spoken languages. I speak all 3, and listened to all 3! I recommend the original, unless you really hate subtitles.",
         "Although far from a great film, this is certainly not the worst thing I've ever seen. I saw without prejudice and enjoyed it although I did find it full of oddities. I was very surprised when I looked it up afterwards and saw all the hate being spewed out, which is why I felt I should write this review. Sure it has some curious ideas such as: The boy Pinocchio played by a 50 year old man. Actually once you get over his age, he puts in a playful joyful performance which reminded me of Danny Kaye at times. Bad dubbing. Not much can be said in defence of this, but the voices used, such as John Cleese and Glen Close are appropriate in themselves, it is just the bad syncing that is annoying. Some rather cheap-looking special effects. This could certainly have been better but it is sad that people can no longer use their imaginations. As said, these detract from an honest attempt to remake the children's classic. But why the hate? As many have said, I think that this is a much less sentimentalised version of the Disney, closer to the original story and some have taken against it. All in all, children of all ages will enjoy this film and probably learn some valuable life lessons from it. See for yourself and make u your own mind.",
         "Now, one word of advice: watch the English-subtitled version, NOT the English-dubbed version. I had no option but to watch the dub, and it lacked, well, everything. Then, later, I had the luxury to watch the subtitles. Still lacked quite a lot, but much better than the dub. For my review, now. The movie didn't have much substance to it. Honestly, I love the story of Pinocchio, but the movie turned it into a bland, empty form. There was no good acting, nothing that really stood out. I never really laughed at anything, or had a heartfelt feeling towards anything. To me, it was just about 2 hours of people talking. And nothing happened that made too much sense. They changed the story so much it took everything away. Even a fantasy like Pinocchio was so unrealistic, beyond the point of belief. I didn't feel there was much moral, as the boy says he's learned his lesson, but continues to lie and lie and lie. Too many things just kept happening. There wasn't just a basic storyline like: Event 1, 2, 3 (maybe even 4), and a resolution. It was more like Event 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, etc. The characters just change randomly, also. You don't know whether to like them or hate them. The whole time, I was thinking \"I love how sweet Pinocchio is, oh wait, he lied. He betrayed her. But he realized his mistake! Good boy! Oh no! He ran off on a promise!\" And so on. All the movie lived off of was slapstick humor, drastic character change, and unnecessary repetition of events. I hope I won't have to watch this horrendous movie ever again.",
         "It stays much closer to the book than the Disney movie, but it doesn't capture the magic of either. The Disney movie's story was different from the book, but it stood as its own version of the story. That version was classic. This film fails to capture any of the charm of the book or movie. All charm and magic is replaced by annoyance, and stupidity. The dubbing is the worst I have ever seen, and the voice actors of the dubbing do a horrendous job. The children are played by adults, and it feels so strange and awkward. I like strange things, but this the kind of strange that makes you scratch your head. The feel is all wrong. If your a big fan of the Disney film like me you will feel hurt watching this movie. 0 stars out of 4",
         "OK for idea, OK for old Benigni as Pinocchio, OK for the heck of it. But what is not OK is a devastating flaw. They don't respect my adequate vision, they don't respect my intelligence. EVERYTHING you see on the screen is verbalized. Take away the dialogue and you get the full experience anyway. This would have been a fine silent movie. Not one line of dialogue is not reading aloud what they depict. Mostly the characters are talking to themselves to make sure we, the dumb audience, get it and believe our own eyes. Or is this really a joke, a movie for blind people!? Gee Benigni, that's a good one, wink-wink! Or maybe the soundtrack was meant for radio broadcast? This idiotic dogma of having the characters say aloud what we have just seen on the screen is ubiquitous in nearly every Hollywood trite flick and it was sad to see this from an Italian production. Maybe it was a courtesy to an expected American audience. I often wonder, is the broad American public audience really dumb and blind or is it the Hollywood industry that is stuck in a rud of condescension."
