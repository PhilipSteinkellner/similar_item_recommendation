         "I watched blank: A Vinylmation Love Story and loved it! I think the creative group that worked on this movie was extremely passionate at Disney and they put all their hearts into this project, the results definitely shows! The dedication the team put into this series was unbelievable! The love and time they dedicated to this project was so much! The commitment to finish and make of BLANK a total success was such a delight to see evolve! The passion they shared with others about the project made it come to all the public! The Vision to make it a success shows and is something to be so proud about! Congrats Blank team I loved it!",
         "I cannot deny that I found the title \"Blank: A Vinylmation Love Story\" slightly confusing as I expected animated characters that look like records in this movie. But that's not what we get. At least you could understand that it is an animation film as love story with items is usually animated and here it is the case as well. There were some cute moments in this film, but I still believe this would have worked a lot better as a film that runs between 5 and 9 minutes and not for almost 40. It was sometimes fairly difficult to understand the exact action as there is no dialogue in here at all. The music is nice to listen to, but cannot make up for that. Maybe it is one of these films that you have to watch several times to understand it exactly, but my motivation to rewatch is pretty much zero. It was neither interesting enough or good enough for that. Overall, looking at how many people wrote and directed this film, it is another case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. Not recommended."
