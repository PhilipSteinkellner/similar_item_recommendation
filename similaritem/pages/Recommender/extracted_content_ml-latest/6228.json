      "reviews": [
         "A superb comedy from 1942, written by Sidney Buchman and Irwin Shaw, and directed by George Stevens, this movie has a little bit of everything in it: comedy, drama, social commentary, suspense and mystery. It also features three of the most charming stars to ever grace the screen: Cary Grant, Jean Arthur and Ronald Colman. As this was filmed on the Columbia lot it has a Capra-esque feel to it. There is also a dark, austere quality to the photography and lighting that evoke the wartime mood, otherwise not evident in the film. The story concerns Cary Grant escaping from jail and hiding out in the summer cottage of middle-aged bachelor law professor, Ronald Colman. Grant's character (named Leopold Dilg, who has a fondness for borscht with an egg in it), was falsely accused of burning down a textile mill. Jean Arthur's local gal vacillates bewteen these two very different men, who, as things turn out, get on quite well with one another. Grant teaches Colman a thing or two about real life, while Colman instructs Grant in the law. The problem is that the gentle professor doesn't know that Grant is in trouble with the law. Things gets awfully complicated near the end, as the story turns melodramatic, not altogether happily, as it had been for the most part up till this time a warm, funny study in character and mistaken identity. Overall, the movie is hard to fault. The actors are so engaging and the dialogue so good, one can forgive almost anything. There's a nicely suggested small-town New England feel to the film, which does not caricature Yankee types, as was so often the case at the time, and is most refreshing here. Grant is, as usual, so excellent that one forgets that he is acting, as he manages to suggest working-class origins, genuine intellectual curiosity, and a hint of anger, especially in the eyes, as his performance perfectly sums up what the film is about, without drawing too much attention to itself. A remarkable achievement, for Grant, director Stevens, and everyone involved in this happy production.",
         "I don't understand why this movie isn't more popular or regarded as a classic in the canon of early Hollywood movies. All the stars are wonderful in their roles, but Ronald Coleman is fantastic as an ivory tower jurist who is forced to rethink his philosophy. Maybe Claude Rains could have played this part, but without the subtly sarcastic bemusement that Coleman brings. Maybe because it can't be categorized definitely as a screwball comedy or a \"serious\" movie, it has been overlooked. I found it much funnier than \"Bringing Up Baby\" for example, even though \"Talk\" is a great deal more serious and introspective. A lot of the suspense that might have been put into the story was bled out by the philosophical approach that the movie takes. Every potentially suspenseful situation that could have been played out for at least half of the movie is extinguished within fifteen minutes at the most. But that's part of the fun! It gets rolling, and you can't quite tell where it's going all of the time. Watching Cary Grant mug suavely and Jean Arthur speak like she's ad-libbing, you just have to sit back and enjoy it. It's not interested in manipulating its audience, it's actually trying to present real characters in a compelling story. I loved it!",
         "Never will you see a movie that mixes comedy, romance, social commentary, and drama as well as this one. In some ways this movie pre-tells the McCarthy era of the 50's. Also, this movie takes some interesting turns and does what only a handful of my favorite movies have accomplished; it does not reveal it's true dramatic arc until well into the second act. But hey, you've got Cary Grant, Jean Arthur, Ronald Coleman, and even \"Uncle Joe at the Shady Rest\" having a wonderful time on-screen, and the audience goes along for the ride. I won't hide the fact that Jean Arthur is my favorite classic era actress. She's talented, smart, funny, and had the guts to stand up to the movie moguls of the 40's, putting her career in jeopardy in the process. Only some stiff supporting acting prevents this movie from receiving my highest rating. Check out this film and be reminded how great an \"old\" movie can be. ****1/2 out of *****",
         "Talk of the Town is an excellent combination of a screwball comedy and legal drama. Grant plays well in both genres and is aided here with very capable co-stars, Arthur and Coleman. The discussions between Dilg and the professor concerning the practical and theoretical aspects of the law are both entertaining in their tit-for-tat presentation and thought provoking in their philosophical content. Jean Arthur is also very charming as the love interest who helps move them to compromise. I thoroughly enjoyed this intelligent, witty, funny, and well-acted film and strongly recommend it, 8/10.",
         "The Talk of the Town puts visiting law professor Ronald Colman in a delicate situation. He's rented a cottage for some peace and quiet before going before a Senate committee dealing with his nomination to the Supreme Court. But things are anything, but peaceful in the town of Lorchester, Massachusetts. The factory owned by Charles Dingle has burned down, arson is suspected and Cary Grant in an unusual working class role is the suspected arsonist. He's a man of radical opinions in the town so he's a convenient suspect. As the factory was the main employer in the town you can imagine that folks are crying for blood. Which brings an escaped Cary to that same house that Jean Arthur has rented to Colman. Though there are some amusing moments to be sure from all three of the stars, I find The Talk of the Town to be more serious than dramatic. Grant challenges Colman to come down out of the ivory tower he's been living in and apply his high minded principles to real life, if not necessarily his case. When he does Colman does it with a vengeance and it brings down a whole lot of Lorchester's leading citizens. Though Grant and Arthur are first billed, this film really belongs to Ronald Colman. His character is modeled I believe on a recent Harvard law professor who was also appointed to the Supreme Court, one Felix Frankfurter. Of course what the impeccable English Ronald Colman playing WASP Michael Lightcap and a Viennese Jew have in common is not obvious at first. But before becoming mentor to a host of New Deal civil servants, Felix Frankfurter was not only a professor of law at Harvard, but concerned himself with a host of social issues. He was for instance, very prominent in the defense of Sacco and Vanzetti whose plight in the twenties is very similar to Cary Grant's. Like Colman's character Lightcap, Frankfurter was also known as a man of impeccable integrity, who even his worst enemies conceded. He could also be a bit too high minded at times and had to be brought to realize in his philosophy of judicial restraint, that the courts are and should be an instrument for progress and social change. His story would make an excellent film itself. Although I can't see Felix Frankfurter putting the moves on beauty parlor owner Glenda Farrell to learn the truth about the arson. Farrell who graced many a Warner Brothers crime feature in the Thirties has the best of the supporting roles in The Talk of the Town. Also the ever unctuous Charles Dingle is wonderful as the very corrupting influence on the town itself. Colman's final speech to the mob who are ready to lynch Cary Grant is a masterpiece, one of his best moments on screen. The words ought to be required reading and viewing for those who would dismantle our judicial system out of heated passion of the moment. As a film that challenges folks to live up to the creed they espouse The Talk of the Town should not be missed.",
         "Talk of the Town is a good movie! It is well written with witty and interesting, sometimes even surprising dialogue. It is well directed and well played. Even the score is really good (I am not sure if both John Williams and Frederick Hollander borrowed or it was just Williams who borrowed form Hollander for Star Wars). I grew fond of Roland Coleman through this movie, he is simply debonair. Sure, the preaching toward the end of the movie is a bit thick, but it is in character\u0085 and should you listen closely you would find that the message is as relevant today as then. And about the love triangle plot\u0085 It keeps you guessing till the last moment (only one other movie successfully does the same: Casablanca). Talk of the Town is an intelligent and endearing mix of comedy and drama, it does not use comedy only for the introduction but keeps it up, in parallel to the drama, well through the movie; in that it is remarkable. To say the least it did not deserve to be forgotten, for it does what movies do best: give you a good time.",
         "It's entertaining suspense with lively lines and conversations, even discourse on law and justice --- fugitive scenario with the ever radiant Jean Arthur as the spunky heroine in the whirl of it all. Suspenseful tale touching on society's reactions to law and order, yet comedic with subtle hints of romance, delivered in polished words and flowing pace -- thanks to the wonderful trio of Cary Grant, Jean Arthur and Ronald Colman -- humor not missing a beat even at the critical moments. Simply well-crafted direction by George Stevens, optimizing a sharply written script by Irwin Shaw and Sidney Buchman, based on Sidney Harmon's story. It's absolutely delightfully enjoyable. Cary Grant is Leopold Dilg, the fugitive. Jean Arthur is Nora Shelley, a schoolteacher whose house becomes the hideout for Leopold. Ronald Colman is Professor Lightcap who happens to arrive on the scene to occupy Miss Shelley's house for summer rental. Such crisp delivery: using newspaper headlines flashing across the screen, the first 5 minutes -- short of 2 brief spoken lines -- set the atmosphere and tone of the story simply by what we see on screen (enhanced by music). The ending was just as succinct in few spoken words -- well-edited character expressions and the quick cut scenes were effective vs. using dialog. Music essentially complements the unfolding plot -- sometimes spices up the tempo of the film. No words are wasted here. No foul language (an occasional \"darn\" perhaps), no gratuitous action/violence, no car chase (a just as exciting dogs-chasing-man scene there is). Wit, charm and humor abundantly applied. The film also attempts to have a moral message (not at all preachy) on how everyone should treat law and order. It presents questions (serious and light): \"Why does man lie?\" \"If you want to get information out of a woman, how do you go about it?\" \"What are extenuating circumstances about the law?\" and not forgetting a pun or two: \"Your cold will thaw. Everything thaws.\" Lively lines with comedic pacing are blended into the precarious situations of the storyline with flowing humor. Every supporting role has his/her particular part in the grand scheme of things and each little scene is flawlessly integrated into the plot. It's wonderful to watch this film. Rarely do we have a suspense that's so very entertaining -- comedic and romantic, too -- all wound together into 1:58 length -- colorfully presented in Black and White. Simply timeless. MUST-SEE classics this is. Made in 1942, the subject of law and order still applies today. Other B/W timeless pieces with Jean Arthur, the ever energetic talking-continuously-in-one-breath heroine, are three from Frank Capra: \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\" 1936 with Gary Cooper, \"You Can't Take It with You\" 1938 with James Stewart, and \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\"1939 with James Stewart encore. More B/W gems with Cary Grant besides the Hitchcock classics, and the famous George Cuckor's \"The Philadelphia Story\" 1940 with Katharine Hepburn and James Stewart, are: Cuckor's \"Holiday\" 1938 with K. Hepburn, Howard Hawks' \"Bringing Up Baby\" 1938 also with K. Hepburn, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's \"People Will Talk\" 1951 with Jeanne Craine. Albert Lewin's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" 1945, based on a novel by Oscar Wilde, is yet another rare gem of B/W classics, somehow with (necessary) true color segments included. Intriguing contemplative tale.",
         "Cary Grant has a curious role in this film - he is a labor agitator. He has been stirring up matters in his native town against the local big business factory, owned by Charles Dingle. Then, there is a fire at the factory - an arson fire. Grant is suspected and arrested for the arson (and subsequently for the murder of Tom Tyler, the factory foreman who is missing and presumed dead). Grant manages to escape capture, and heads for the home of one of his oldest friends - Jean Arthur. What he does not realize is that Arthur has rented the house for the summer to a law professor of note, Ronald Colman. Arthur is willing to hide Grant in the attic, but Colman does arrive, only to find that the sheriff and a pack of hounds are at his door (and due to some unexpected clothing switching the hounds chase Colman up a tree). Starting with this situation, THE TALK OF THE TOWN blossoms into a neat little comedy triangle that tackles the issues of what is law, and what do we expect of it? Colman's Professor Lightcap is a quiet judicial scholar - a man of books. Probably too many books. Later in the film, Grant's Leopold Dilg tells Arthur's Nora Shelley that he's looked at the legal tomes Colman reads (and upon which his judicial philosophy is based) and they are intelligent, comprehensible, \"and dead.\" Colman, in short, is a legal conservative, and so has a tendency to support the status quo. He is also an appointee (awaiting confirmation) to the U.S. Supreme Court. All this is hardly promising for Grant and Arthur, who hope that Colman can assist them in saving Grant from prison or worse. Grant's attempts at getting Colman into the real world is limited by his inability to appear in public (he is a wanted man, after all). But Arthur, and Grant's attorney Edgar Buchanan, are capable to take Colman around the town and make him realize that Grant has not been given a fair chance to defend himself. The film concentrates on Colman's slowly becoming a realist - seeing that the opinions of one hundred years of precedents are not the be all or end all of justice. It begins when he meets Dingle, and then the trial judge (who seems all too prejudiced against Grant before the trial - not to mention too chummy with the owner of the factory). As he comes down to earth, he even strips himself of his badge of ivory tower-ism - his beard, which he shaves off (much to the distress of his valet, played by a subdued but funny Rex Ingram). I leave it to the viewers to see how Colman eventually does get Grant out of his legal difficulties. The movie is one of the few (up to that date in the 1940s) that looked at the legal system critically. The massive dislike of the townspeople towards Grant (where they all have been financially hurt by the factory fire they blame on him) makes a fair trial in that town impossible. It reminds us of the issue nowadays about media coverage of crimes where local jury pools get tainted by prejudgments of defendants thrust down their throats. Yet Colman is warned by his political friends to avoid involvement - to keep himself clean before he is confirmed. You wonder what is the value of a seat on the Supreme Court if the would-be judge cannot make sure that justice is even handed and as near pure as possible. To me TALK OF THE TOWN may not be a great film but it is above average, and an unusual one for both male leads - for Grant in his character's personality, and for Colman for his gradual concentration less on his rivalry with Grant over Arthur as with the battle for justice. Before TWELVE ANGRY MEN came out over a decade later, TALK OF THE TOWN was the best movie about the philosophy and reality of the law (except for THE OX-BOW INCIDENT) Hollywood produced.",
         "Social commentary either elevates the value of a film or bogs it down, and with comedies it is generally the latter. \"The Talk of the Town\" is no exception; while it is a fun film that has much to admire, the pretensions of the film-makers often get in the way of what could have been a masterpiece of comic suspense. The tone becomes almost unbearably preachy at times, and some of the monologues on `justice' and the `pursuit of truth' are excruciating on the ears. Thankfully, the good people at Columbia hired just the right people to star. The specific political stances of Leopold Dilg are never made clear; we're just supposed to accept the idea that he's a good guy who is put down by a corrupt system. Fortunately, Cary Grant uses his remarkable charm and talent to turn in a performance that allows us to sympathize with a character whose background is far too vague. Likewise, Jean Arthur and Ronald Colman are able to invest interest in characters that might otherwise have come off two-dimensionally. The charisma of the three leads fuels a love triangle that does a far better job of moving the story forward than any \"serious message\" that the film-makers were trying to impart to the audience. Grant, Arthur, and Colman are rightfully remembered as three of cinema's finest actors, but they deserve special credit for adding some much-needed pizzazz to this movie. All in all, \"The Talk of the Town\" is a rambling, misguided movie saved by smart casting and disciplined acting, not to mention more than a few laughs. It is a classic example of skilled performers triumphing over flawed material.",
         "This movie, \"The Talk of the Town\" is George Steven's only serious comedy. He copies Frank Capra's theme of the common man against big business and big government and he makes a home run. The casting was supreb from the three leads to all the supporting cast in the smallest of roles. This is Jean Arthur's most romantic movie where she must decide who to love. It's a great ending. She gets kind, adult talk with the most romantic kiss from one of her co-stars. It's a shame they don't make love scenes like this today. Today they are into graphic love scenes. Besides, you get a history and moral lesson on ethics in business and government."

         "In suburban Lochester, New England, three people end up living together in high school teacher Nora Shelley's rental house. The first is her new tenant, renowned Harvard law professor Michael Lightcap, who has rented the house for the summer while he writes his new book. The second is Nora herself. Despite having an auspicious first meeting, Lightcap hires Nora to be his live-in cook and secretary for a week until his manservant Tilney arrives. The third is Joseph, the property's gardener, who is currently laid up with a sprained ankle. In reality, Joseph is Nora's childhood friend Leopold Dilg, who has just escaped from prison. Leopold was being tried for the arson of the factory where he worked, and for murder for the death of the factory foreman Clyde Bracken, whose body was never recovered but who is assumed to have died in the fire. Despite the danger to herself, Nora hides Leopold since she believes his story that although he, as an activist, did speak out about the dangerous conditions at the factory, he did not set the fire, which he assumes was done by the factory's owner, Andrew Holmes, to collect the insurance money, all the while having Leopold as a scapegoat. Nora campaigned to get the job with Lightcap if only to be able to better hide Leopold in the house. Leopold escaped if only because he knew he would not get a fair trial due to the rabble rousing being conducted by Holmes against him. Lightcap and who he knows as Joseph end up getting along famously, although activist Leopold believes Lightcap's view of the law is too clinical for him truly to be a great lawyer or great judge, those thoughts arising if only because Nora and Leopold learn clandestinely that Lightcap is being appointed to the Supreme Court. Nora, Leopold and Leopold's lawyer, Sam Yates, try to get Lightcap involved in helping Leopold by showing him that Leopold indeed will not get a fair trial. In the process, Lightcap may in turn show Leopold and Nora that his current way of thinking has much merit.",

Escaping, Leopold hides out in the home of his childhood sweetheart Nora Shelley ...which she has just rented to unsuspecting law professor Michael Lightcap. As Lightcap's unwelcome guests, Nora and Leopold drag the professor, willy-nilly, from theory to practice. Blends comedy, thriller, philosophy, mystery and romance.",
         "When accused arsonist Leopold Dilg escapes jail, he hides out in the home of old friend (and sweetheart) Nora. Nora happens to be renting a farmhouse to Supreme Court candidate Michael Lightcap, but she lets Dilg hide in the attic while Lightcap gets settled. The next day, she introduces Dilg as the gardener. In conversation, though, Lightcap realizes that the gardener has a lot to say about the law! Nora and Dilg team up to convince him that Dilg was framed. The three dodge the cops, try to capture the real crooks, and discover that both men have fallen for Nora. Two different endings were filmed, one in which Nora gives her heart to Dilg, the other in which she leaves with Lightcap. Guess which one remains the classic comic conclusion.",
